# Chapter 1: I Will Never Miss You in the Next Life

New Year’s Eve, West City Cemetery.

“This might be the last time I come to see you…”

“Don’t worry, even if I’m gone, everything’s been arranged. Someone will come to pay respects every year.”

“When we were kids, you promised to spend every New Year with me. How many years has it been now? Liar…”

Qin Yang gazed at the woman standing before his tombstone, murmuring endlessly to herself.

She was around middle age, her face touched by the traces of time, but her features clearly showed that in her youth, she must have been a stunning beauty.

This woman was his childhood sweetheart, Tong Wanhua.

Only someone as stubborn as her would come out in such freezing weather, with snow falling no less.

A gust of cold wind swept through, and Qin Yang frowned, instinctively reaching out to pull her away.

But his hand grasped nothing.

He’d forgotten again—he was just a wandering soul.

Seventeen years ago, he had died.

Back then, he was thriving, having saved up a good deal of money, only to pass away unexpectedly.

He had no family left, so the government was supposed to handle his affairs. But to his surprise, Tong Wanhua stepped forward, claiming to be family, and had him buried here.

From that day on, Qin Yang had lingered in this cemetery as a soul, drifting until now.

“Tong-jie, all the paperwork’s done.”

A young woman jogged over, handing a tablet to Tong Wanhua.

Qin Yang recognized her as Tong Wanhua’s personal assistant.

Tong Wanhua focused intently on the tablet, and Qin Yang leaned in to look. His heart jolted in shock.

It was a cemetery plot purchase agreement.

The document stated that Tong Wanhua had bought a plot in this very cemetery. Qin Yang estimated its location—it was one row behind his own grave, slightly to the side.

From there, she’d have a clear view of his tombstone.

Who was this plot for?

Tong Wanhua was only middle-aged. It was far too early for her to be buying a grave.

And what did she mean, this was her last time visiting him?

Was she never coming back?

Qin Yang’s mind swirled with questions.

But Tong Wanhua said nothing more after reviewing the document. She signed it, gave his tombstone one last lingering look, and turned away.

The biting wind howled, and her eyes seemed to shimmer with unshed tears.

That gaze held reluctance, longing, and a hint of resolve before she walked away.

Was she going home?

Qin Yang instinctively followed her.

It wasn’t until he climbed into the car that he realized he’d left the cemetery.

He couldn’t stray too far from his tombstone, or his soul might dissipate entirely.

But…

As Qin Yang looked at Tong Wanhua’s profile, memories of their past flooded back.

They’d been childhood sweethearts, even bound by a childhood engagement.

But later, his father’s business failed, his parents divorced, and his family fell apart under a mountain of debt. They were no longer equals.

In his teenage years, pride and rebellion overshadowed everything else.

She was the school beauty and a top student, while he was more like a delinquent.

He feared others learning of their connection and felt unworthy of her.

So he distanced himself, even lashing out with harsh words on purpose.

At some point, he stopped seeing the little shadow who used to trail behind him.

Blinded by pride, he thought everything was going according to his plan.

After high school, he failed to get into college, while she went to Yanjing to study. They lost contact entirely.

Years later, Tong Wanhua, now a famous star, sought him out. She brought up their childhood engagement, saying she wanted to marry him.

He was no longer the reckless youth of before, but he made the same choice as his younger self.

He rejected her again.

She said nothing, only left in silence.

It wasn’t until after his death, when he heard her pouring out her heart beside his body, that he learned the truth—

She had always liked him.

Always harbored a secret love for him.

Never forgotten him.

And now, the Tong Wanhua before him merged with the image of her sobbing uncontrollably back then.

A powerful premonition gripped Qin Yang.

If he missed this chance, he’d regret it for eternity!

He’d already missed her twice.

If he had to die, so be it!

He was just a wandering soul anyway.

The car sped along and soon stopped.

Qin Yang floated out and saw they’d arrived at a private sanatorium.

He followed Tong Wanhua inside, where a professional medical team was already waiting.

A heavy unease settled in his heart.

Was Tong Wanhua sick?

“Ms. Tong, everything’s ready. Please sign here again.”

A nurse handed her a tablet, and Qin Yang caught a glimpse, his shock deepening.

It was a consent form for medically assisted death!

“Tong-jie, with today’s medical advancements, surely you…” The assistant’s voice broke with a sob.

Tong Wanhua signed with a flourish. “Late-stage liver cancer is hard to treat. I’ve lived long enough, and I’m tired. No need for regrets.”

Qin Yang froze.

Late-stage liver cancer?

She looked so healthy.

How could she have late-stage liver cancer?

It had to be a misdiagnosis!

No one could answer his questions.

The staff moved with calm efficiency.

In a daze, he followed her to a hospital room, where he saw the CT scans, the MRIs, the diagnosis reports.

They confirmed not only late-stage liver cancer but also severe depression, spanning twenty-seven years.

His heart sank, bit by bit.

The last time she visited his grave, she’d joked that when she was too old to walk, she’d put a QR code by his tombstone to “chat” with him, keeping up with modern trends like digital grave visits.

Just one week later, everything had turned upside down.

And… how could she have depression?

Twenty-seven years of it?

Questions piled up in his mind.

Tong Wanhua lay on the hospital bed as a nurse hooked up an IV drip of glucose.

Her assistant sat nearby, discussing inheritance and other matters.

The assistant hesitated. “Tong-jie, there’s still an empty plot next to Mr. Qin’s grave. Why didn’t you…”

Tong Wanhua gave a bitter smile. “Him… If I were buried beside him, he’d probably hate me even more.”

Pain stabbed Qin Yang’s heart.

How could he ever hate her?

He’d just realized too late!

Tong Wanhua pulled something from her pocket, her eyes brimming with nostalgia. “The spot I picked is nice. It has a good view of him.”

The item in her hand looked familiar. After a moment, Qin Yang recognized it—it was the Hello Kitty origami he’d made for her as a child.

Back then, Hello Kitty was all the rage, and Tong Wanhua loved it, so he folded one for her.

He never imagined she’d keep it all these years.

The paper had yellowed, yet she caressed it gently, as if it were a treasure.

She murmured softly, “Brother Qin Yang, I’ll see you again soon. If… if there’s a next life…”

A doctor entered with a vial of medicine, confirmed everything, and began administering it.

The medicine dripped slowly, drop by drop. On the bed, Tong Wanhua clutched the origami to her chest, her hands folded, a smile of anticipation and contentment on her face.

Qin Yang clenched his teeth, his eyes burning.

He was already dead.

How could his eyes still burn?

He sat by her bedside, placing his hand gently over hers.

He knew he couldn’t touch her.

But in her final moments, he wanted to be by her side.

The woman on the bed looked frail, and the wandering soul beside her bore the weight of years.

Yet in that moment, they seemed to return to their childhood.

To the days when they were still innocent playmates.

Qin Yang spoke words no one could hear.

“Tongtong, if there’s a next life, I swear I won’t miss you again.”

…

A flash of white light.

Qin Yang’s vision blurred, sounds fading and then rushing back.

“Qin Yang, daydreaming even here?”

A stern voice jolted him. He looked up to see his high school headteacher, Zhou Heping.

“Sleeping in class is one thing, but zoning out when I call you in? You’ve got the college entrance exam next year!”

Zhou Heping spoke earnestly, but Qin Yang barely registered it.

Where was this?

Why did it feel so familiar?

It looked like his high school teacher’s office.

Back then, he was hauled in every other day for a scolding. This place was all too familiar.

But… how was he here?

He was with Tong Wanhua just moments ago.

“Did you hear anything I just said? Transfer to the humanities track now, and with some rote memorization, you might scrape into a vocational college. Stay in the sciences, and you’ll graduate high school with nowhere to go!”

Zhou Heping spoke again.

Memories flooded back.

This was the conversation he’d had with his headteacher on the first day of his senior year.

Zhou Heping pulled out a transfer form.

“I’ve filled out the application for you. Take it home and get your parents to sign it.”

Qin Yang stared at the form, identical to the one in his memory.

So.

He’d been reborn?
