# Memorize - Chapter 12 (12/1068)

# 00012 Split in Half

Nobody spoke a word. Park Dong-geol’s words had pierced everyone’s hearts like a dagger. Licking his dry lips with a hint of saliva, he continued without missing a beat.

“I don’t think trust is necessary when you prioritize your own survival. The team I want is one where we help each other without holding anyone back. In other words, I only want to travel with people who are prepared for that.”

“That’s… too much.”

Lee Bo-rim’s voice trembled with emotion. She didn’t seem ready to back down, though. Meanwhile, An-hyeon, who had been keeping Park Dong-geol in check, and the sharp-tongued girl fell silent. Despair flickered across Lee Bo-rim’s face, but she soon opened her mouth with a desperate expression.

“Call me selfish if you want. It’s all or nothing anyway. Let me make this clear: if it comes to it, I’ll go off on my own. I’ve already got a target on my back… Honestly, I’m not the only one fed up with your half-hearted attitudes, am I? The guy with the crossbow got frustrated and left to scout, didn’t he? You all need to think about this.”

“Are you kidding? How can you know who’s useless or unhelpful without even trying?”

The sharp-tongued girl shot back immediately, but her voice lacked conviction. Park Dong-geol seized the moment, his face lighting up as if he’d been waiting for this.

“‘How can you know without trying?’ Are *you* the one kidding right now?”

“What did you say?”

“Do you still think this isn’t reality? Do you think you’ve got extra lives or something? This isn’t some computer game where you can reload a save point. Wake up! If we all rush out there and someone screws up, even just once…”

Park Dong-geol paused briefly, then drew his thumb across his throat in a slicing motion to finish his point.

“We all die.”

His final words hit hard, causing a visible stir among the group. Lee Bo-rim stared blankly at the ground, while the sharp-tongued girl chewed her lip in silence. Only the woman with the cool demeanor maintained her calm expression from the start.

“And let’s not misunderstand. I know you don’t like me, and I’ll admit I’m partly to blame for that. I’ll apologize again. But don’t stir things up with reckless words. I haven’t said anything about abandoning anyone yet.”

Seeing their reactions, Park Dong-geol flashed a sly grin, thumped his chest, and shouted, “Since we’re on the topic, let’s settle this now. If anyone agrees with me, come to my side. As long as you’re resolute, I’ll welcome you.”

The moment his words landed, a tense atmosphere enveloped the hill. His speech had shaken them, and now they were glancing at each other warily. As much as they hated to admit it, his words had effectively rattled their resolve. By tapping into the primal instinct for survival, he’d cleverly buried his own agenda.

The ripple effect spread like wildfire. Even An-hyeon and An-sol were hesitating, and the sharp-tongued girl, who had clashed with Park Dong-geol repeatedly, showed signs of wavering. In contrast, the thug casually tapped the polished metal rod he’d brought, exuding confidence.

Frankly, as long as An-hyeon and An-sol didn’t join him, I didn’t care much. But just to be safe, I activated my Third Eye and turned it toward the sharp-tongued girl and the woman I hadn’t checked yet. I needed to at least see their stats. My first target was the sharp-tongued girl, who seemed quite promising.

< Player Status >

1. Name: Lee Yu-jeong (Year 0)
2. Sex: Female (22)
3. Height/Weight: 166.3 cm / 51.7 kg
4. Alignment: Good · Neutral
   - [Strength 32] [Endurance 38] [Agility 50] [Stamina 30] [Magic 48] [Luck 46]
   - (Remaining Stat Points: 0)

*Hmm.*

No wonder she was bold enough to challenge Park Dong-geol—she had the stats to back it up. While An-hyeon and An-sol were exceptional, her initial stats were far from lacking. Her high Agility and Magic opened paths to both melee and magical disciplines, a rare blessing. I decided to keep Lee Yu-jeong in mind. Next, I turned my Third Eye to the other woman, who also piqued my curiosity.

< Player Status >

1. Name: Kim Han-byeol (Year 0)
2. Sex: Female (21)
3. Height/Weight: 170.2 cm / 48.5 kg
4. Alignment: Lawful · Chaos
   - [Strength 28] [Endurance 32] [Agility 46] [Stamina 24] [Magic 68] [Luck 40]
   - (Remaining Stat Points: 0)

< Unique Ability (1/1) >

1. Charisma (Rank: F Plus)

“Ugh.”

The moment I saw her Unique Ability, I couldn’t help but let out a gasp. *Charisma?* I was momentarily speechless, struck by a shock similar to when I’d checked An-sol’s stats. It hit me why Kim Han-byeol had reminded me of *her*—because *she* had talent in Charisma too.

I briefly regretted looking, but I shook my head to clear the thought. My mind felt tangled. Based on my original plan, both Lee Yu-jeong and Kim Han-byeol were talents I couldn’t afford to let slip away.

Lost in complicated thoughts, I absently gathered and released a handful of dirt. Doubts crept in. An-hyeon, An-sol, Lee Yu-jeong, and Kim Han-byeol—their stats were well above the average for new Users in the Hall Plane. Even if they’d been scattered, people of their caliber should have had a decent chance of survival.

*Is there something I’m missing?*

No matter how much I pondered, I couldn’t reach a conclusion. I could make guesses, but nothing was certain. I decided to set the thought aside for now and reactivated my Third Eye to assess the situation. Since I’d resolved to take all four of them with me, I’d have plenty of chances to observe them later.

---

The first to move was Lee Sin-u. With an alignment of Lawful · Good, he was kind but often lacked resolve, easily swayed by others. His Luck stat was decent, but the rest of his stats were unremarkable, so I silently wished him luck and let him go.

“I-I really want to join the team!”

“Hmm…”

Park Dong-geol sized up Lee Sin-u for a moment before asking in a low voice, “You have to protect yourself. If you become a burden, I won’t hesitate to leave you behind.”

“I understand! I’ll do my best!”

“Alright. If you pull your weight, I’ll do my best to help you too. Let’s survive this hellhole together. And… I’m sorry about earlier. I was too on edge. I sincerely apologize.”

The moment Park Dong-geol gave his approval, Lee Sin-u’s face lit up, and he rushed to his side. Their tight embrace wasn’t exactly pleasant to watch. Having secured Lee Sin-u, Park Dong-geol turned to An-hyeon next.

“You there. Think carefully. You’d be welcome anytime.”

The thug emphasized “we” with a subtle tone, and An-hyeon’s face showed hesitation. He stood at a crossroads, and the choice was entirely his. Not just An-sol but almost everyone watched him intently, swallowing hard. Finally, An-hyeon spoke slowly.

“My answer is the same. I’ll never abandon my sister.”

His voice was calm, without inflection. An-sol’s face brightened instantly, and the female banker looked relieved. But An-hyeon wasn’t done.

“Still… if your team includes Sol, I’ll consider it positively.”

*Oh, boy.*

With that, the situation tilted back in Park Dong-geol’s favor. The choice was now his, exactly what he’d wanted. He put on a slightly troubled expression before responding reluctantly.

“That’s a bit difficult. Honestly, you’re fine, but protecting your sister, Sol, would be tough—and I don’t intend to.”

“You don’t need to worry about that. I’ll handle both our shares.”

“It’s not that simple. Unexpected things happen… like in the clearing incident. If she holds us back, it’ll be a problem.”

“Then I have no choice—”

“Let’s put it on hold for now. If you’d spoken up first, maybe, but let’s discuss it again once the team is set.”

Park Dong-geol deliberately cut An-hyeon off, leaving room for ambiguity. His calculated move was clear. Only An-hyeon and I had actively fought the Deadman, but I wasn’t present, so the group’s weight naturally shifted toward An-hyeon. Of course, Park Dong-geol had no real intention of accepting him, but by leaving the door open, he’d successfully shaken the others again.

“You… do whatever you want. Arguing like this only wears me out.”

Park Dong-geol glanced at Lee Yu-jeong, brushing off her response vaguely. She frowned but didn’t say anything more. He turned away without lingering and addressed Lee Bo-rim and Kim Han-byeol, who were still standing quietly.

“So… I’d like to hear your thoughts.”

“…”

“Don’t get me wrong. If I really meant to abandon anyone, would I have accepted this guy? He clearly told me he wouldn’t hold us back, that he’d protect himself and contribute. I didn’t take on this role because I wanted to. I’m serious about going it alone if I have to. But if you want to survive, you have to act, right? So, if you want to join this team, make the same promise—in front of everyone.”

“What do I need to do…?”

Lee Bo-rim was the first to respond. Park Dong-geol glanced at Kim Han-byeol before continuing.

“Just say you’ll contribute to the team in some way, not just rely on blind protection. If I think you’re not pulling your weight, I’ll kick you out without hesitation. But if you contribute, we’ll do our best to support you. If you’re ready to toughen up, join us.”

Contribute in *some way*. The phrasing sounded odd, almost dangerous. Lee Bo-rim seemed to vaguely sense it, hesitating, while a look of contempt crossed Kim Han-byeol’s face. Park Dong-geol smacked his lips and turned to Kim Han-byeol.

“Same goes for you.”

“…Give me a moment.”

Kim Han-byeol, still wearing her cold expression, closed her eyes as if to think. I felt a twinge of concern, but if my guess was right, she’d likely hold off on deciding. Park Dong-geol, as if allowing her that space, stepped back and slung an arm around Lee Sin-u.

Assuming someone would naturally refuse to join was the stuff of novels or comics. In reality, humans are emotionally fragile creatures. When survival is on the line, pride often gets tossed aside.

How much time passed?

In the end, it was Lee Bo-rim, the banker, who moved first. She gave a faint nod, stood up weakly, and took a step toward Park Dong-geol. Her inner conflict was evident, but she ultimately lowered her head and joined him and Lee Sin-u.

At that moment, Park Dong-geol flashed a triumphant smile.
