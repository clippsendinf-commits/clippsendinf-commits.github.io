# Chapter 99: Su-hyeon's Madness

“Huuaaa….”

As the creature opened its mouth, a chilling murderous intent spread through my entire body. Yet, I didn’t slow my charge. The monsters we’d encountered on the second floor so far were all mere fakes. Even this so-called Wraith Knight was likely using some trick, so I could afford to remain calm. There’s always a difference between the real thing and a counterfeit. Well, except for Gigas.

Sensing the intensity of my approach, the creature firmly raised its shield and swung its sword. A dark blue sword aura surged forth, carrying a menacing energy as it flew toward me. But such a straightforward attack was never going to hit me.

If my goal had been to give the kids experience, I probably would’ve called for An-hyeon. I felt a bit bad for Yu-jeong, but I had already decided to end this fight quickly.

*Skeng!* *Sssss….*

With the authority of a Sword Specialist, I sliced through the sword aura in one stroke, and I could see the glow within the creature’s helmet blaze even fiercer. The Wraith Knight and I clashed head-on. I had intended to shatter its shield outright, but as I saw a dark energy seeping into it, I furrowed my brow.

At that moment, Jeong Ha-yeon’s voice rang out from behind, chanting a spell.

“───. Ice Cannon!”

Ice Cannon was a high-level water spell. She likely cast it to knock the shield away before I engaged. A long, icy beam shot forward, striking the creature’s shield directly. And then—

*Patzzt! Patzztzzt!*

“Ah…?”

The dark energy emanating from the Wraith Knight’s shield clashed with Jeong Ha-yeon’s Ice Cannon, sparking as they vied for dominance. But the struggle was brief. After a short tug-of-war, the Ice Cannon was absorbed into the shield. The Wraith Knight’s shield had consumed her spell.

Those laboratory freaks sure cooked up some bizarre stuff. I heard Jeong Ha-yeon’s puzzled voice, but I forcefully kicked upward. Whatever trick the creature was pulling, removing its shield would suffice.

*Crack!*

This time, I put real strength into the blow, and the Wraith Knight couldn’t withstand it, losing its grip on the shield. Though it had no face to show emotion, I could sense its panic. As the shield flew into the air, the Ice Cannon it had absorbed shot toward the ceiling, and I flashed a triumphant smile. So, it tried to redirect that at me, huh? Feeling a surge of indignation, I infused my sword with mana and struck its chest plate hard.

“Huuaaa…!”

The creature’s chest armor caved in, and it was pushed back forcefully. Seizing the opportunity, Yu-jeong darted past me, chasing after the retreating Wraith Knight.

“Haaat!”

Tch. No sultry battle cry this time, huh? No, that’s not the point. Anyway, as the Wraith Knight slid back and slammed into the wall, its guard was partially down after losing the shield. Yu-jeong immediately brandished her daggers, unleashing the frenzied dagger technique she’d shown before—her Drum Barrage Dagger Art.

“Hat, hat, hat, hat, hat, hat, hat, hat, hat, hat!”

Letting out sounds that were either laughter or battle cries—hard to tell which—Yu-jeong swung her daggers like a storm. Honestly, it wasn’t like An-hyeon’s precise, single-strike approach; it was chaotic slashing. But against a disarmed enemy, it was highly effective.

After checking the creature’s state, I sheathed my sword and turned around. The party, who had been watching silently, now stared at me with wide eyes. Even Vivian, who was preparing another spell, tilted her head in curiosity.

“Hyung,” An-hyeon called out.

“What?”

“Uh… isn’t the monster still…?”

“Hm? It should be done by now.”

I muttered casually and glanced back just in time to see the Wraith Knight let out a mournful scream before collapsing. In our initial clash, I had destroyed the core that sustained it and delivered a massive shock to its essence.

Shrugging, I turned back to the party, who were now looking at me and Yu-jeong with dumbfounded expressions. It couldn’t be helped. Since I’d decided to speed up our pace, I had to sacrifice some of the kids’ experience-gaining opportunities.

“Yahoo! I took it down! Did you see that, An-hyeon?” Yu-jeong cheered, bouncing with excitement, her mood clearly lifted.

Jeong Ha-yeon sighed, and Shin Sang-yong followed suit. They seemed to have some unspoken agreement, as they didn’t react further. But An-hyeon was different.

“This is ridiculous!” he blurted out.

“Huh?” I looked at him, surprised by his sudden outburst.

“Hyung!” he shouted, his eyes blazing as he glared at me.

“What?” I responded coldly.

“This wasn’t Yu-jeong’s doing! You did all the work, and she just landed the final hit!”

“Hm… and?” I countered.

At that, An-hyeon’s face lit up, and he turned to Yu-jeong with a smug grin. “See? Even Hyung agrees. You’re just gloating over a last hit!”

“…….”

I’d momentarily forgotten how stubborn these kids could be. That’s not the issue, you idiots, I wanted to say, but since it didn’t hurt me, I just sighed in response. Jeong Ha-yeon glanced between the kids and me, her expression a mix of exasperation and pity.

“Why are you looking at me like that?” I asked.

“…Raising these kids must be exhausting,” she replied.

“Haha… haa,” I let out a bitter smile.

Jeong Ha-yeon gave a faint smile in return. Meanwhile, An-hyeon and Yu-jeong’s bickering continued.

“No way! Didn’t you see my dazzling dagger technique?” Yu-jeong shot back.

“Dazzling, my foot. You were just flailing around!” An-hyeon retorted.

“Pfft. At least I don’t dance around with a spear like some people.”

Was she referring to the time An-hyeon supported me against the giant on the first floor? He’d nearly dropped his spear then, and she was probably teasing him about it. An-hyeon’s face flushed red, clearly recalling the incident.

The two started trading barbs again, their voices laced with occasional profanity—a real spectacle. The atmosphere was turning unnecessarily hostile. Did they completely ignore what I said earlier? I didn’t want to embarrass them in front of other users, given how long we’d been together, but I was about to snap.

“Stop it!” An-sol stepped forward, shouting sharply.

Her yell silenced An-hyeon and Yu-jeong instantly. The usually meek An-sol’s angry outburst stunned them. She seemed to think her expression was fierce, but to me, her pursed lips were just adorable.

“What are you two doing? Don’t you remember what Su-hyeon Oppa said earlier?” she scolded, invoking my name.

The two glanced at me nervously before lowering their heads. They had no comeback. I crossed my arms, deciding to observe. These kids ignored my repeated warnings, but getting scolded by someone younger might make them reflect.

“We’re in the middle of an expedition! Your bickering is ruining the mood for me, for Oppa, and for the two mages. Don’t you realize that every time you act like this, you’re making Su-hyeon Oppa, our caravan leader, lose face?”

Well said! I didn’t know she had it in her. Had she been waiting for a chance to shine?

Their faces showed frustration, but An-sol’s words were undeniably correct. Yu-jeong, unwilling to back down completely, spoke up in a sulky tone. “But… An-hyeon keeps picking fights with me. I fought hard too…”

An-sol nodded solemnly, as if acknowledging her point. Wait, since when does she get to acknowledge anything?

“You’re right. An-hyeon Oppa was wrong to start it,” she said.

“Hey! She was the one boasting about something she didn’t even do!” An-hyeon protested.

“That’s not the point. You overreacted, Oppa. Is it so hard to just praise her for doing well?” An-sol countered.

Yu-jeong flinched, clearly caught off guard. She’d meant to tease him, but An-sol’s defense left her unable to retort. Admitting she was just messing around would only invite more criticism.

An-hyeon, shocked that An-sol wasn’t taking his side, went blank before turning his head away sharply. “Hmph. Praise what? I can’t. No, I won’t. There’s nothing to praise!”

“Ugh… Oppa, that’s not what I mean,” An-sol said, stepping forward to block Yu-jeong, who looked ready to snap back.

“She just wants your approval. You always criticize her, Oppa, but never give her a single compliment or kind word.”

“…….”

An-hyeon stayed silent. An-sol, with a gentle, almost motherly smile, approached him and softly took his hand. He didn’t turn to face her but didn’t pull away either. The scene was like a mother soothing her son, and the party’s atmosphere grew somber.

An-sol, with infinite kindness, stroked his head with her other hand. “There’s a saying that even a whale dances when praised. If you praised her, Oppa, I’m sure Yu-jeong Unni would… no, wait.”

“?”

An-sol stopped mid-sentence, a question mark practically hovering above her head. She tilted her head, realizing she’d said something off.

The party, drawn in by her speech, felt a sudden sense of unease. Then, we realized what it was.

“…….”

“…….”

A heavy silence fell over the group. I closed my eyes, fighting an inexplicable urge to laugh. I tried to calm myself, but it was no use. This kind of struggle was rare for me.

*Grind. Grind.*

I cracked my eyes open to see Jeong Ha-yeon biting her lip, her teeth grinding as she tried to hold it in. Shin Sang-yong’s lips twitched, clearly in the same boat. Only Vivian, who hadn’t lived on Earth, tilted her head in confusion. But Yu-jeong wasn’t one for restraint.

“Pfft.”

“…Ahem. I got my words mixed up,” An-sol mumbled.

“Pffft!”

“Ahem, ahem. Anyway, Unni—”

“Pffhahahaha!” Yu-jeong burst out laughing, unable to hold back.

An-sol tried to keep the mood serious, but each time Yu-jeong’s laughter interrupted, she faltered. The others held it together, but Yu-jeong was rolling on the floor, laughing hysterically. An-sol’s face flushed red, and she shouted again in a trembling voice.

“It was a mistake! Stop laughing!”

“Haha! Dance, hahaha! Praise, hahaha!” Yu-jeong gasped.

“Stop laughing already!”

After laughing uncontrollably, Yu-jeong sprang to her feet, gripping her daggers in both hands. She dangled them loosely and began swaying her hips provocatively toward me. It was a ridiculous dance, but she giggled and said, “This isn’t dancing. It’s praising Oppa! Heehee!”

That one line from Yu-jeong was the spark that set it off.

“Pffhahahaha!”

“Hahahahaha!”

Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong couldn’t hold back any longer and burst into laughter. Even An-hyeon and I couldn’t help but join in. The solemn atmosphere An-sol had built was shattered by her slip-up, and it was just too funny. An-sol, red-faced, tried to regain control, but as the laughter showed no sign of stopping, she finally burst into tears.

“Waaah!”
