# Chapter 46: Preparations for Takeoff

“Yujeong-ah.”

“Yeah?”

“If a situation like the one just now… you know, something unavoidable comes up again, what will you do?”

“…I don’t know.”

Yujeong replied with a grimace. She must have felt incredibly frustrated. Even if such a situation arose again, she knew nothing and could do nothing about it. If she had to give an answer, her only option would be to let it happen. I was about to offer words that would be like a refreshing rain to parched seedlings.

“Does everyone know a bit about Mana Emission?”

After pushing them hard, it was time to ease up a little. The kids seemed to notice my softened tone, cautiously lifting their heads to gauge my expression. Their demeanor reminded me of children scolded by their mother, sulking before timidly looking up again. I couldn’t help but smile inwardly, though I kept it to myself.

“The ability that woman used at the table earlier is part of Mana Emission. It’s not the activation of a Special or Potential Ability but rather a Control Ability that anyone can use by manipulating their mana.”

To be precise, techniques like Sword Aura and Sword Energy were also considered part of Control Abilities. I could see Yujeong’s eyes light up after hearing the term “Control Ability.”

“Control Ability…? Oppa, does that mean we can use it too?”

“Yes. With practice, you can. Furthermore, in situations like the one earlier, you could resist or even defend yourself. Depending on how you respond, you might even be able to counterattack.”

“Teach us.”

Seeing the kids’ faces gradually come back to life, I gave a gentle smile. If they had stayed dejected, I might have been genuinely disappointed. But as a path opened up, Yujeong’s eyes began to blaze with determination, as if her earlier gloom had never existed.

The plan was to teach the theory thoroughly, demonstrate, and then move to practice. At Yujeong’s request, I nodded willingly and began.

“Does anyone know the stages Mana Emission can be divided into?”

“Sensing, Occupy, Coercion.”

To my surprise, it was Ansol who answered immediately. She was looking at me with eyes full of longing and intensity. When I nodded awkwardly in response, her face lit up. I briefly wondered if her odd expression earlier was due to jealousy because I patted Hyeon’s head but not hers.

…No way that’s the case. Anyway, Ansol’s answer was nearly correct. There were higher stages like Break Up and Demolition, but those were far too advanced for them to learn now, especially compared to the first stage, Sensing. So, I deliberately held back.

“From now on, I’m going to teach you a truly powerful technique.”

The preamble was over. It was time to get to the main point.

There’s a saying: “Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times.” It means you truly understand something only by experiencing it yourself. I slowly began to channel my mana and turned halfway around to face away from the kids.

I carefully regulated my mana, letting it flow across the entire floor of the room. Centered on my body, I created a circular field infused with my mana. Having done this thousands of times, it felt like second nature, an extension of my body. I sensed the kids staring at me blankly as I stood still. Closing my eyes, I spoke slowly.

“Hyeon, Sol, Yujeong-ah. From now on, don’t say a word. And try to move somewhere in the room as quietly as possible, without making any sound.”

At my words, the kids hesitated briefly but soon began to move quietly, one by one. They thought they were being stealthy, but with my detection active, they were like ants in the palm of a Buddha. I heard a faint creak and confirmed they had all finished moving. Still facing away, I spoke.

“An-hyeon. 38 degrees southeast from your left foot. In front of the wardrobe. Ansol. 26 degrees southwest from your right foot. Behind the central table. Yujeong. 90 degrees from my position. On the bed.”

The moment I finished, I heard the kids gasp sharply. If they were this shocked already, we were in for trouble. Smiling faintly, I continued.

“This is called Sensing, the first stage of Mana Emission. It’s often referred to as an invisible eye, but in reality, it’s about connecting your mana circuit to the objects around you. In other words, you’re arbitrarily expanding your cognitive range using mana. You all were startled when that woman appeared out of nowhere, right?”

“Now that you mention it…”

“Y-Yes… Yes, that’s right. So, hyung, if we learn Sensing, we’ll know when that woman is coming?”

I nodded without turning, sensing An-hyeon was starting to catch on.

“Generally, yes. But Sensing isn’t foolproof. There are ways to bypass it.”

This time, I intensified my mana to a level they could distinctly feel, letting an intangible force surge fiercely before spreading it through the air. Like heat shimmering upward, my mana instantly filled the entire room. Seeing the kids look around in wonder, I made another request.

“Now, express a number with your fingers.”

I gave them enough time to process and act, then spoke calmly.

“An-hyeon. Two fingers. Index and middle. Ansol. One finger. Index. Yujeong. Four fingers. Index, middle, ring, pinky… Two, four, one, five, four, five. This one’s tricky.”

Yujeong, in disbelief, quickly changed her fingers mid-way, but I answered effortlessly. I could sense her arm drop limply in defeat.

“Huh…?”

“What…?”

“Amazing…!”

Hearing their exclamations, I finally turned to face them. Their jaws were practically on the floor, as if they’d seen a ghost. Maintaining my mana’s hold over the room, I continued.

“There are several ways to bypass Sensing. Using speed the opponent can’t react to, entering through the air, or subtly blending your mana with theirs. To counter more reliably, the next stage after Sensing is called Occupy.”

“Oppa, so the ability that woman used was Occupy?”

I shook my head at Yujeong’s question. Occupy was the second stage. The ability that woman used was Coercion, the third stage.

“No. She used Coercion, the third stage of Mana Emission. It’s a higher-level technique where you infuse your will into your mana, going beyond merely expanding your cognitive circuit. The strength varies by user, but mastering Occupy allows you to fully defend against or at least partially resist such Coercion.”

“Then I want to learn Coercion! I want to learn it!”

Seeing Yujeong’s eagerness, I gave a faint smile and stepped toward her. I flicked her forehead lightly. As she pouted and rubbed her forehead, I spoke in a soothing tone.

“You can’t even walk yet, and you’re already trying to fly? Unless you’re a genius, Coercion isn’t something you can learn overnight. Even at the fastest, it takes three months of steady practice. Master Sensing first, then move up step by step. Don’t be too hasty.”

“Hyung.”

An-hyeon’s voice called out as he stared at me. Turning to him with a questioning look, he spoke up.

“I want to learn Coercion too…”

“Seriously, you guys. I said it’s too soon.”

Shaking his head, he clarified.

“No, I mean, I want to know more about Coercion.”

“Oppa, me too. I was so flustered earlier that I couldn’t think straight, but… at least I want to see what Coercion is like. Please?”

I paused at Yujeong’s plea, supporting An-hyeon. The essence of Mana Emission lies in how precisely and effectively you control your mana. They might learn Sensing quickly, but they didn’t yet grasp how difficult it was to project it outward and infuse it with will.

Yet, in their eyes, I saw a passion I hadn’t seen before. It reminded me of my early days in the Hall Plane, struggling to learn anything, clawing my way up through self-study without proper guidance. That bittersweet memory stirred something in me, and I spoke slowly, as if entranced.

“The third stage of Mana Emission is on a different level from the first two. It requires efficient mana control, precision, and flawless circuit deployment. But the most important and difficult part is infusing your will into your mana.”

“Will…?”

“The key is how effectively you can convey your emotions. You don’t even need words. The mana infused with your will says it all. Think back to earlier, Yujeong. What did you feel?”

Yujeong frowned, thought for a moment, and answered.

“My body felt heavy… I felt danger. Like I might die…”

“That’s called killing intent in technical terms. That woman was telling you she wanted to kill you, without saying a word, by conveying her intent and emotions through her mana.”

“…”

Yujeong didn’t respond, but her face paled instantly, goosebumps rising. An-hyeon tilted his head, still not fully understanding. I sighed softly. Since I was still maintaining Occupy, I figured a brief demonstration might satisfy their curiosity.

I steeled myself and called out to An-hyeon.

“Hyeon-ah.”

“Yes?”

“From now on, I’m going to want to kill you.”

“What does that mean…?”

Caught off guard, An-hyeon trailed off as he realized I was about to demonstrate something, just like with Sensing and Occupy. His face hardened, and he braced himself. Of course, to me, his efforts were futile.

I closed my eyes and entered a state of mental training. I set An-hyeon as my mortal enemy, someone I’d face in a life-or-death duel. After centering myself, I opened my eyes and explosively unleashed my mana.

“Argh! Aaaah!”

The reaction was immediate.

My initially ethereal aura transformed into a thick, murderous intent in an instant. A heavy, crushing killing intent filled the room, as if it could tear anything apart. The murderous urge welled up from deep within me, and I directed it entirely at An-hyeon.

It lasted only five seconds. Any longer, and I risked being consumed by my own past killing intent, so I forcibly suppressed it at the right moment. As I withdrew the energy and contained it, I saw An-hyeon sitting on the floor, trembling, his legs having given out. Yujeong and Sol were also shaking, indirectly affected by the killing intent.

I slowly approached An-hyeon. He flinched instinctively as I neared but then looked at me blankly, as if realizing something. I extended my hand to help him up.

“No matter how much you steel yourself, Coercion using mana is unavoidable. It directly exposes raw, instinctual human emotions. Good job enduring it.”

An-hyeon, still dazed, shook his head vigorously. He hesitated but eventually took my hand, struggling to stand as the shock hadn’t fully worn off.

As our eyes met, I noticed something intriguing. For a fleeting moment, a spark of competitive spirit flashed in An-hyeon’s eyes. Perhaps because he was a man, he had a unique belligerence that Yujeong and Sol lacked.

After helping him up, I addressed the three users, who were still staring at me.

“For now, Coercion is far beyond your reach, so just understand what it is. Sensing comes first. If you can’t even handle that, you’ll be useless out there. So, unless you can maintain Sensing for at least an hour, don’t even dream of stepping outside.”

At the mention of maintaining Sensing for an hour, Yujeong hurriedly asked.

“But oppa, when did you learn these techniques? We all had similar training, didn’t we?”

Her question caught me off guard, but I kept a calm expression. I couldn’t exactly say I learned them before my regression, so I needed a plausible response. Raising my hand, I extended my index finger.

“I made use of personal maintenance time outside of training. I also got a lot of help from the instructors. For reference, it took me one day to learn Sensing, about two weeks for Occupy, and I mastered Coercion near the end.”

“So, all those times you sat in weird positions before bed were for Sensing practice?”

An-hyeon’s timely comment bolstered my credibility. I just smiled, and he tilted his head, muttering, “I thought you were just meditating.” Ignoring their reactions, I continued.

“Anyway, that’s how long it took me. If you think you can surpass me, give it a try. I’m a bit curious to see who’ll master it first.”

My words, laced with a hint of provocation, had an immediate effect. As I challenged them to surpass me, An-hyeon, Sol, and Yujeong exchanged glances and suddenly began burning with determination.

“Well, I think I’ll be the first to succeed. Just watch, hyung.”

“Hohoho. Sounds like you’re saying your mana stat is higher than mine.”

“No, wait, guys…”

Seeing them glare at each other, I couldn’t help but sweat. It felt like siblings competing in front of their mother to see who’d get the best grades. I was increasingly feeling like their mom.

The theory was done. The demonstration was over. All that remained was the start of real training.

Regardless of the circumstances, the change in their attitudes was undeniable. As soon as they resolved to learn, they began practicing on the spot. After a while, as they sat still with their eyes closed, quietly channeling their mana, I added detailed explanations.

“The basic operation of mana starts with visualization. The principle of Sensing comes from ripples and waves. Picture a calm sea and a single drop of water falling onto its surface, creating circular ripples. Or imagine a drop of water falling onto dry paper. Create an image that feels comfortable and familiar to you, and move your mana along your circuit with that feeling.”

To be honest, the operation of Sensing itself is relatively simple. Unlike the advanced techniques required for Coercion, Break Up, or Demolition, it operates on a straightforward principle.

The key to Sensing is how cleanly and how long you can sustain it. You need to distribute your mana efficiently and maintain a consistent flow.

An-hyeon and Yujeong, who were diligently practicing Sensing, were starting to show signs of struggle. They succeeded in drawing out their mana and creating a circle beneath them, but maintaining it for an hour, as I had stipulated, was proving difficult. Their circles were becoming distorted, and the flow of mana was growing irregular.

At first, they wore confident smiles, but as time passed, sweat beaded on their faces, and they began to grit their teeth. I smiled faintly, watching them.

There was a reason I chose to teach Sensing first. It’s said that Sensing alone can gauge a user’s potential, and it’s a skill that will be useful time and again. Its benefits are numerous. In terms of training, it can be practiced anywhere, anytime. Beyond increasing mana, it pushes the body to its inner limits, potentially boosting other stats as well.

Moreover, though this is just my speculation, I believe my Potential Ability, Mind’s Eye, was heavily influenced by Sensing. I always stayed vigilant, maintaining a calm mindset in battle, predicting opponents’ attack paths, and striving for optimal combat strategies. In other words, it could aid in awakening Potential Abilities suited to the individual.

Additionally, consistently maintaining a steady mana flow can prevent wasteful mana expenditure when using Control Abilities. Thus, Mana Sensing training is a practice that can yield multiple benefits.

Over ten minutes had passed since they began Sensing. An-hyeon and Yujeong were a sight to behold. Their initial bravado was gone, replaced by profuse sweating and labored breathing, looking as if they might collapse at any moment.

As I watched them closely, I briefly activated my Third Eye to check their stat growth.

**User Information (Player Status)**  
**Name:** An-hyeon  
**Stats:**  
[Strength 59] [Endurance 57] [Agility 74] [Stamina 61] [Mana 49] [Luck 61]

**User Information (Player Status)**  
**Name:** Ansol  
**Stats:**  
[Strength 16] [Endurance 21] [Agility 24] [Stamina 29] [Mana 84] [Luck 100]

**User Information (Player Status)**  
**Name:** Yujeong  
**Stats:**  
[Strength 48] [Endurance 52] [Agility 64] [Stamina 50] [Mana 68] [Luck 56]

An-hyeon’s strengths lie in his balanced physical stats and high agility. Excluding mana and luck, his stats showed steady growth. His high agility is particularly advantageous for spearmen, suggesting great potential for growth if he maintains this trajectory. His mana stat is a slight concern, but with remaining points and proper training, it can be addressed.

Yujeong’s overall physical stats are above average or average at best. Her strength, endurance, and stamina could use improvement, but her agility and mana are her strengths. For a close-combat class, a mana stat of 68 is a remarkable advantage and a blessing.

Comparing An-hyeon and Yujeong objectively, An-hyeon currently has the edge. However, as a mercenary with versatile applications, Yujeong’s future potential is exciting. While I slightly regret she didn’t choose assassin, mercenary isn’t a bad choice either.

Ansol’s stat growth is the lowest among the three. However, I’m focused solely on her mana. Since she chose priest over monk, there’s no need to obsess over strength, endurance, stamina, or agility. Her high mana and near-maximum luck stats are perfectly suited for a priest.

Seeing her mana rise from an initial 75 to 84 points, I felt satisfied. Compared to Han-byeol, her growth rate isn’t as impressive, but considering that stat growth slows significantly in the mid-80s, reaching 84 fresh out of the Hall Plane is remarkable. I couldn’t help but wonder how far her potential could go.
