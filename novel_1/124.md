# Memorize - Chapter 123: A Small Rebellion

“Well then, that concludes today’s schedule. Everyone, use the remaining time for personal maintenance or rest.”

“Hmm.”

“Haauu…”

After finishing dinner, I announced the end of the day’s tasks to the group. Their reactions varied, but two stood out as particularly noteworthy. Yujeong was fidgeting, nervously biting her nails as if something was bothering her, while Ansol immediately buried her forehead on the table the moment I finished speaking. Her face was etched with exhaustion, likely from struggling to keep up with Hayeon’s teachings.

Hayeon, on the other hand, sipped her tea with a calm expression. Despite saying she wanted to rest today, she had clearly put in her best effort to teach Ansol. Knowing her personality, she wouldn’t have gone easy, so I could roughly guess the kind of ordeal Ansol had endured.

Still, I felt grateful to Hayeon. Not only had she accepted my request to mentor Ansol, but she was teaching her with genuine dedication. Ansol was a challenging student, to say the least—prone to getting frustrated and teary-eyed, ready to cling to someone if the tone of voice was raised even slightly. It was no small feat to handle her, and I’d often found myself at a loss. But Hayeon, never one to raise her voice, likely guided her gently, though her words probably cut like a cold breeze. Satisfied that Ansol had such a capable teacher, I was lost in thought when a voice interrupted.

“Oppa…”

Yujeong called out to me, her usual lively demeanor replaced by a hesitant expression.

“Yeah?” I responded lightly, pulling out a cigarette.

Her voice wavered with uncertainty. “Tonight… are you busy? Do you have more work to do?”

“Hmm. Yeah, I’ve got some things to discuss with Hayeon and Sanyong, and I need to organize some records.”

“What about tomorrow?”

“There’s work tomorrow too… Why?”

As I nodded in response, Yujeong pouted, her lips jutting out. “Never mind. It’s nothing,” she muttered before quietly sipping her tea. I tilted my head at her reaction but quickly turned to Hayeon and Sanyong.

“Hayeon, Sanyong.”

“Yes, Leader,” Sanyong replied.

“Yes, please go ahead,” Hayeon said.

“I’ll head up to my room first. We might have a lengthy discussion, so please wrap up whatever you’re working on and come to my room. It’d be better if you could come together to avoid repeating things.”

“Haha, sounds good to me. I was just discussing magic circles and summoning techniques with my mentor,” Sanyong said with enthusiasm.

His words piqued my interest. Vivian, though she could seem a bit clueless at times, always exceeded expectations when given a task. Today, too, she had grasped exactly what I wanted and acted accordingly. I looked at her with an approving smile, and she straightened her neck, elegantly sipping her tea. 

Seeing her like that, I couldn’t help but want to tease her a bit. “I want to mess with her,” my gaze seemed to say. Vivian caught it, gave me a playful glare, and her cheeks flushed slightly. I barely managed to look away before things escalated—definitely not wanting to cross that line. (I thought I heard her click her tongue softly as I turned, but I decided I must’ve misheard. Surely, I misheard.)

Vivian was an excellent teacher, and Sanyong was an eager learner—a perfect mentor-student dynamic. Hayeon and Ansol, however, were a different story. 

Hayeon nodded as if my suggestion was perfectly timed, while Ansol lifted her buried face, staring at me in shock. Hayeon’s next words showed no mercy.

“That works. Ansol, you heard him, right? So, we’ll add an extra hour of training tonight.”

“Ugh… uuu…” Ansol looked horrified, her eyes darting between me and Hayeon.

What kind of teaching had reduced such a gentle girl to this state? I gave Hayeon a questioning look, but she merely shrugged. Still, I was the one who’d requested her guidance and chosen to trust her.

“…Please take care of her,” I said.

“Of course. Don’t worry too much,” Hayeon replied with a slight smile.

I backed off, and Ansol’s soft whimpers filled the air as I sighed inwardly. Were they just immature? The kids were great, but sometimes I noticed small, frustrating flaws. They lacked a sense of urgency. They didn’t realize how fortunate they were as new users in the Hall Plane. Part of that was my fault. From the Rite of Passage onward, they’d never gone hungry or lacked for anything.

To reiterate, surviving the first year as a new user in the Hall Plane is nearly impossible. I’d experienced that myself. In my first cycle, I barely scraped by with one meal a day, constantly worrying about food and shelter, always lurking around the square to find a caravan to join. A mentor to guide me? That was unthinkable.

But these kids were different. Because I’d provided for them from the start, they had no idea how desperately most new users lived. If I took a struggling user, fed them regularly, clothed them, and gave them a skilled mentor, they’d probably break down in tears and bow a thousand times in gratitude.

They were like students grumbling about studying, unaware of their privilege. In time, as they gained experience in the Hall Plane, they’d realize how lucky they were to have this path. It was a distant hope, but I decided to embrace it like a parent raising children.

Hoping they’d grow quickly, I resolved to leave before their complaints escalated. 

“I’ll head up now. Take your time, but make sure to finish your tasks properly before coming.”

I drove the point home firmly and climbed the stairs, ignoring the stares boring into the back of my head.

“Suhyun, working again? It’s only been a day since you returned from the expedition. You’re pushing yourself too hard,” Hayeon said, knocking on my door about an hour later.

I was poring over records about the Cave of Screams. She looked at me with concern, worried about my health. Her care made me feel oddly like we were a newlywed couple. Wait—did that make Hayeon the stepmother to the kids?

“Don’t count on that kind of luck again,” she continued. “Exploring around the city should be enough for now. I still feel the aftereffects of that power in my body… The harder you work, the more I worry. For my sake, let’s just talk tonight and then rest.”

“Alright, if you insist,” I replied.

Hayeon smiled, relieved by my compliance, and I returned a gentle smile. In my first cycle, I rarely felt these emotions, but in this second cycle, I was discovering them one by one. Though I was wary of letting these feelings dull my edge, they weren’t entirely unwelcome.

As we shared a warm moment, the door burst open, and a bespectacled user rushed in—Sanyong, of course. He bowed hastily upon seeing us.

“L-Leader, sorry I’m late.”

“It’s fine—”

“You’re exactly seventeen minutes late,” Hayeon interrupted, her tone icy. “If you’re going to be late, you might as well be properly late or come on time.”

I was about to brush it off, but her sharp words cut me off. Sanyong looked flustered, bowing repeatedly before hurrying to the table. I suddenly felt a pang of sympathy for him.

The atmosphere grew awkward, but I cleared my throat to refocus. The topics ahead were critical, the foundation of my plans, and carried significant weight. After a moment to collect myself, I began.

“The reason I called you both here is probably obvious.”

“Yes,” they replied in unison.

“I’ll get straight to the point. I plan to establish a clan in the Hall Plane…”

I nodded once or twice, ready to dive into the details, when a knock interrupted, followed by the door swinging open without my permission. Annoyed, I looked up to see a familiar user step inside—Go Yeonju.

“Oh? I thought you’d be alone. What a shame,” she said playfully.

“What’s the occasion?” I asked, keeping my tone neutral.

“This.”

Go Yeonju smiled prettily and approached with graceful steps. She was dressed differently today, her hair neatly pinned up, and her usual casual attire replaced by something more refined. Wondering what she was up to, I watched as she placed a tray on the table, laden with fragrant food and high-quality liquor.

“I didn’t order anything,” I said.

“It’s a complimentary service for our regular customers,” she replied smoothly, setting the food on the table.

Sanyong, delighted, laughed. “Haha, thank you! I was just getting hungry from all the thinking. Perfect timing. Leader, is this okay?”

“The food’s fine. We’ll eat well,” I said.

Go Yeonju shook her head at my thanks. I half-hoped she’d leave, but, as expected, she defied my expectations.

“Don’t mention it. So, what were you all talking about?”

“Actually, we’re in the middle of an important discussion. Thanks for the food,” Sanyong replied, his words polite but clearly hinting for her to leave.

Go Yeonju, however, didn’t budge. “Why? It’s quiet with no customers. Can’t I join in?”

“Uh…?” Sanyong looked dumbfounded, caught off guard.

Hayeon narrowed her eyes, but Go Yeonju just smiled serenely. Both turned to me, and Go Yeonju’s gaze followed.

With all eyes on me, I tapped the table, staring at her. The Shadow Queen, Go Yeonju. One way or another, she needed to be dealt with—either recruited to our clan or eliminated before we left Mul. It might seem unfair to her, but in my first cycle, her information-gathering skills had caused me endless trouble. I’d let Woo Jeongmin’s group slide for now, but Go Yeonju was different. She needed to be either an ally or removed. Testing her now seemed like a good idea.

As everyone awaited my response, I spoke slowly.

“Have a seat.”

“Thank you~” she said, promptly taking the empty chair.

“Suhyun?” Hayeon asked, confused.

“Leader!” Sanyong echoed, equally startled.

Their confusion was understandable, but I was curious to see how Go Yeonju would react once her identity was revealed.

“Suhyun, do you even know who this user is?” Hayeon began, her tone skeptical.

“Second-year user, Jeong Hayeon,” Go Yeonju interrupted calmly, cutting her off. Hayeon’s eyes flashed as she fell silent, stunned that Go Yeonju knew her name and year.

“A mage user abandoned by the Golden Lion Clan,” Go Yeonju continued, turning to Sanyong. “And you… second-year user, Shin Sanyong.”

“W-What?” Sanyong stammered, shocked that she knew him too.

Go Yeonju smiled, as if finding his reaction endearing, and twirled a finger playfully. “An eccentric mage who loves alchemy.”

Finally, she turned to me, pausing for effect. I met her gaze, her jade-tinted eyes locking onto mine as her calm voice continued.

“Zero-year user, Kim Suhyun. Top graduate of the User Academy… and a peculiar user who’s already conquered two dungeons in their first year.”

“How do you know all this?!” Sanyong exclaimed, his voice filled with shock.

I heard Hayeon’s low chant, preparing a rapid spell, but Go Yeonju remained unfazed. Propping her chin with one hand, she stared at me, ignoring the others entirely.
