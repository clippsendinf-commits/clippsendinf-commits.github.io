# Chapter 59: Mage and Alchemist (Rare)

“Trap… escape…”

Despite speaking in fragmented words, the male priest’s face was etched with exhaustion as he struggled to continue. But as I grasped the gist of his words and repeated them, a flicker of relief crossed his face. He likely mistook us for seasoned Users.

The User nodded faintly, then stammered on.

“Comrades… betrayal… abducted…”

His eyes, fighting to stay open, trembled visibly. Death loomed close, yet he clung to life with desperate resolve. Finally, as if expending his last ounce of strength, he gasped out “Help…” before his eyes rolled back, and he collapsed. The faint spark of life he’d maintained while speaking to us seemed to have burned out completely. As the priest went limp on my knees, I heard the kids gasp.

I gently laid him on the ground and closed his eyes with my palm. A solemn, heavy silence settled around us. Sol’s face, in particular, had gone pale. It was clear she couldn’t remain indifferent in the face of death. But there was no time to indulge in sentimentality. For now, piecing together the keywords the User left behind and deducing information was the priority. I quietly repeated his words.

“Trap. Escape. Comrades. Betrayal. Abducted.”

“Hyung, could this be related to the Vagabonds?” An-hyeon, having overheard the User’s words, offered his own theory, but I shook my head. While it was a possibility, knowing the future as I did, his guess was off the mark. After a moment of thought, I pieced together a plausible scenario.

The kids looked anxious, their lips constantly moistened with nervous licks. I felt the need to explain. Meeting their expectant gazes, I spoke in a calm voice.

“At the entrance to the Black Forest, I told you there were Users who entered before us, right?”

“Yes, I remember… Wait, you mean…?” An-hyeon nodded, his eyes lighting up as he looked at me. He often seemed oblivious in everyday matters, but in moments like this, he showed a different side. It was reassuring to see his mind sharpen in a crisis. I gave a nod of affirmation and continued.

“Right. It seems that caravan discovered this dungeon before us. But… for some reason, the caravan was either wiped out or suffered a catastrophic loss.”

“Then, oppa, what do those words the User said mean? Like…” Yu-jeong’s voice trailed off.

“Hmm…”

Trap. Escape. Comrades. Betrayal. Abducted. At Yu-jeong’s question, I began to flesh out the vague picture in my mind with more detail. Until now, I’d assumed the caravan was annihilated due to the absence of a guide. But now, it was clear my prediction was entirely wrong.

Recalling the corpse we saw when we first entered the dungeon gave me the answer. If you thought about it, there was no way they died right at the entrance. There were no visible threats nearby. That archer must have survived long enough to enter the dungeon’s interior. And they were likely part of the caravan, serving as a guide.

After organizing my thoughts, I spoke in a low voice.

“The caravan was probably heading in the same direction as us. But if you look at the way that User’s body was positioned, his head was facing the direction we came from. His lower body was torn, and there was a large hole in his back, which means he was fleeing toward the direction we came from and was struck from behind. In other words, the words ‘trap’ and ‘escape’ suggest they entered the dungeon, got caught in a trap, suffered a major incident, and were trying to escape back the way they came.”

“Then… what about ‘comrades,’ ‘betrayal,’ and ‘abducted’?”

“The User we saw when we first entered the dungeon was an archer. They were likely part of the caravan’s group. But for some reason, they betrayed their comrades. The word ‘betrayal’ can have many meanings, but in the context of a dungeon… it’s highly likely they fled to save themselves.”

As I finished explaining “betrayal,” I could see a wave of negative emotions ripple across the kids’ faces. But since I’d already warned them early on to steel themselves, I offered no further cautions. Now, it was time to explain the final word: “abducted.”

“And the last word… it seems some of the caravan’s Users were abducted by the dungeon master.”

“Is that even possible?” An-hyeon’s eyes widened as he asked, and I responded with a matter-of-fact expression.

“Of course. The Hall Plane isn’t a game—it’s a real world. Some alchemists are known to experiment on human bodies. Have you forgotten where we are?”

At my words, the kids’ faces turned ashen.

We walked in silence for a while. If our inclinations leaned toward Chaos, we’d probably have turned back to the city without a second thought. But Sol and Yu-jeong, leaning toward Order, were inclined to rescue the abducted Users. The male priest’s final plea of “Help…” had struck a chord. As for me, I was content as long as we kept moving forward, so I had no complaints.

The underground passage grew wider the further we went. As we walked through the seemingly endless tunnel, I raised a hand to halt the group. I’d been maintaining a stronger and broader detection range than usual, picking up details bit by bit. Combat in a dungeon was unpredictable, even for me, so it seemed best to give a detailed explanation before engaging in battle.

“About a hundred meters ahead, there’s an open clearing. A group of monsters is gathered there, roughly over twenty in number. They seem to be Rengas.”

“Rengas? I think I’ve heard of them…” Sol murmured.

“They’re monsters resembling dogs, about 80 centimeters to a meter in size. They’re very agile and have sharp, hooked claws at the tips of their paws,” she added.

“Correct. One more thing: their tails can also be a powerful weapon. They lack the flexibility of a scorpion’s tail, but their destructive power is comparable to their claws.”

I chuckled inwardly at Sol calling Rengas “doggies” or “puppies.” If Rengas had the intelligence to understand such terms, they’d probably riot. I nodded at Sol’s cautious response but pointed out one concern.

“The issue is that the Rengas I’m detecting seem slightly different from typical ones. Everything matches what you described, but… some of them are walking on two legs?”

“What? That can’t be right! I heard Rengas are quadrupedal. Could you be mistaking them for another monster? Oh, no, wait—Su-hyeon oppa wouldn’t make a mistake, so I must be wrong.”

I almost gave Sol credit until that last part. Sighing at her self-deprecating chatter, I continued.

“The claws, the tails, the body shape—it all matches. Let’s move forward and assess the situation. We have to pass through that clearing to proceed.”

An-hyeon and Yu-jeong had been quietly listening to our exchange, and I saw them exchange glances and shrug. Well, they couldn’t join the conversation if they didn’t know the details. They should’ve studied more.

The lighthearted mood ended there. As we neared the clearing, tension surged among the group. I quickened my pace, eventually moving at a near-jog toward the clearing.

I’d fought Rengas in my first cycle. They’re quick to react but hotheaded and incapable of tactical maneuvers. The best strategy was to charge in, take out as many as possible, then lure the enraged survivors while switching to defense.

The kids began running behind me, drawing their weapons. A ranged attacker like an archer or mage would’ve been ideal for landing a big hit and following up with a coordinated assault, but I could cover that role myself.

“Hyung! Are you okay?” An-hyeon shouted, taking deep breaths as he ran, his voice brimming with energy. Gripping his spear tightly, his usual belligerence seemed to surface at the prospect of combat. I signaled that I was fine and gave more detailed tactics.

“Don’t overuse your mana. Focus on maintaining formation. Once we enter the clearing, charge the nearest group, take them out quickly, then fall back to the wall. Rengas fiercely protect their kin, so if we kill even one, they’ll come at us with a vengeance. Their defense is weak, but their speed and claws are dangerous, so stay sharp. And…”

“Yes?”

“They might not be typical Rengas, so keep that in mind. We’re going in. Don’t hesitate—strike down anything in front of you.”

Normally, I’d have thoroughly planned our tactics, but speed was critical here. With their keen sense of smell, lingering too long risked us being ambushed.

As we sprinted, the square-shaped passage I’d mentioned came into view. Beyond it lay a clearing with black soil as its ground. Without hesitation, I crossed the passage and entered the clearing. There, I saw over twenty Rengas milling about.

As expected, they were quick to notice. The moment I entered, every Renga turned toward me in unison, letting out a strange, deflating-balloon-like wail. In a split second, I chose my target, kicked off the ground, and charged.

“Skitt! Skitt!”

Just as I swung my sword at the nearest group, a spear shot past me with lightning speed. It tore through the air and smashed directly into the face of a Renga turning toward me. The creature’s face caved in, shattering into pieces—not pierced, but crushed. Something felt off, but as its body collapsed, it seemed dead all the same.

“One down!” An-hyeon shouted. He’d followed close behind me, using his spear’s long reach to land a preemptive strike, infused with a hefty dose of mana, judging by the shimmering aura around its tip.

Thanks to An-hyeon’s attack, I had a moment to adjust my target to the Rengas nearby and slashed fiercely. Even if caught off guard, they couldn’t dodge my blade, honed by years of experience.

As I sliced through two Rengas’ necks in one swing, I realized what felt wrong. There was no blood. And instead of the soft give of flesh, my sword felt like it was cutting through a hard shell. These… were Chimeras.

“Kiiiii!”

The ambushed Rengas fell into chaos. They’d noticed us but were still scrambling. For a moment, I considered pressing the attack, tempted to take out more. In that brief pause, I saw Yu-jeong dart past me.

“Wait…”

Yu-jeong was charging toward a lone Renga some distance from the three we’d taken down, her body low and her dagger trailing downward. I didn’t have time to stop her. Unlike our initial strike, the Rengas were starting to regroup, and I felt a pang of frustration. The Renga she targeted was already wagging its tail menacingly.
