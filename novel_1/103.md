# Memorize - Chapter 102: Su-hyeon's Madness

I kept moistening my parched lips with saliva. But before I could even compose myself, two colossal torrents of power collided with merciless force, sparing no room for forgiveness.

*Ku-ku-ku-ku…!*

A majestic roar reverberated around us. The demon’s expression was one of leisure, arms crossed with ease. In stark contrast, I found myself swallowing hard, moment by moment. A fleeting thought crossed my mind—had the outcome already been decided? Yet my proud ego refused to yield. No matter what anyone said, *Colossus of Destruction* was my ultimate technique. Retreating here would mean I could never face Lilith-sama again. I poured even more mana into my spell with fierce determination. For a brief moment, I could see my meteoric rain beginning to overpower his swords, a sign that my efforts were bearing some fruit.

But then…

“Haaargh!”

I let out a scream filled with agony. Each clash sent violent shocks through me, churning my insides. Why? How? The questions swirled in my mind, but I barely managed to hold myself together. I had clearly seen my magic overwhelming the human, so if I could just endure a little longer… or so I thought.

“Kuh!”

The moment I raised my head again, I was struck with despair.

The spectacle of my meteoric rain colliding with his torrent of swords was nothing short of magnificent. But I had no time to admire it. Was the dominance I thought I saw a lie? My meteors exploded upon contact with his swords, vanishing instantly. Yet his *Flame Swords* endured the explosions, steadily advancing, claiming the surrounding space bit by bit. No, they weren’t just enduring—they were burning through my meteors with dazzling ferocity.

In that moment, I coughed up a mouthful of blood. A wave of exhaustion washed over me, my strength draining away. Could it be? Was my body collapsing from overexerting my mana, or had the ancient barrier laid by those humans activated at the worst possible moment? Why now…!

I had planned to crush him swiftly and bear all consequences, but instead, I was the one being pushed back. The forbidden spells, arriving sooner than expected, made my heart race with urgency. In that moment of faltering focus, a sudden realization hit me. And that fleeting lapse brought a result that plunged me into deeper despair.

*Hwaaaaarrr…!*

The swords, burning with such pure and radiant flames, were swiftly overpowering my magic, intent on erasing my existence. If I withdrew my power now, my form would be crushed to ash, leaving nothing behind. In a frantic bid, I drew up even more mana. I still couldn’t accept defeat at the hands of a human.

I felt the mana surging through my body, focusing it into my hands. Yet deep down, my true desire was to flee. If I used *Dark Fairy Tale*, I might, with luck, escape with my life. But a stubborn corner of my heart refused to acknowledge defeat, clinging to pride. Even knowing that staying meant death, the centuries I had lived as a demon earl would not allow a single step of retreat.

Yet, as my meteors vanished one by one, replaced by those blazing swords, even that pride began to waver.

As I watched the relentless advance of the *Flame Swords*, I suddenly felt an eerie emptiness behind me. Amid the storm-like clash, the back of my neck felt chillingly cold. Could it be… was it over? Had he burned through my entire *Colossus* spell?

“Farewell.”

The human’s cold voice was the last thing I heard as countless swords surged toward me, blanketing the heavens and earth. My pride, which had held firm until the end, finally took a step back in the face of imminent death. As the swords rushed to tear me apart, I squeezed my eyes shut and summoned the last reserves of darkness within me.

…

……

………

“*Hurk, hurk.*”

When I slowly opened my eyes, I saw a ceiling that hadn’t yet collapsed. At the same time, thunderous noises echoed from above. The moment I took the first hit, I instinctively chose to flee. Using darkness to teleport, I only managed to move two floors down—a short distance within the laboratory. But escaping that horrific technique without being torn to shreds brought a fleeting sense of relief.

“*Cough…!*”

Another gush of blood surged from my throat. I wanted to rest. But several of his swords had already struck me, and my body burned with pain. The thought that the humans might pursue me forced me to rise. Surely, somewhere on the first floor of this laboratory, there was a hidden space…

*Swish, swish.*

Dragging one leg behind me, I stumbled forward for some time. When I reached my intended destination, I saw the door wide open. Not just here—had I already dealt with the enemies in this area before coming up? The thought that I could enter without interference brought a faint smile to my face. I stepped inside and groped along the floor near the door. Surely, surely it was here somewhere.

“Damn it!”

I had been searching the floor for over ten minutes, but I still couldn’t find it. My heart raced with urgency. I had to hurry, before they came. Then, something unfamiliar brushed against my hand as I swept the ground. I lunged toward it, thinking I’d finally found it…

*Chiiik, hwarrrk.*

“…”

The sound of something burning. Right, the aftereffects of his attack must still linger in my body. I tried to ignore it and focus…

“*Phew.*”

“…”

“Didn’t think a noble demon earl would be crawling on the floor, sweeping it like that. What, cleaning?”

His mocking voice reached my ears. Perhaps I had known all along. I had been deluding myself, unwilling to accept the truth. Maybe, from the start, I just wanted to avoid him.

“Doing good deeds now won’t make me go easy on you.”

I slowly turned my head. There he was, leisurely smoking a cigarette.

---

I laughed as I watched him scrabble on the floor. I had been saving the cigarette for later, but I couldn’t resist pulling it out now.

“Didn’t think you’d actually try to run. *Dark Fairy Tale* is pretty handy, huh? You’re as good at fleeing now as you ever were.”

“Human… how… how did you…”

Belphegor gasped, barely able to breathe. I spat out the cigarette and slowly closed the distance between us. As I approached, Belphegor flailed awkwardly, trying to back away. A sharp pang shot through my lower abdomen, a throbbing excitement overwhelming me. This situation was too thrilling.

“Ma… Magic Sword Skrep…”

“Whoa, whoa.”

The moment I saw him try to summon his sword, I darted forward and kicked his hand. The barely formed sword flew off into the distance. Belphegor’s face drained of color as he looked up at me, dazed.

I raised my foot and stomped down hard on his head.

“Beg.”

“Urgh.”

“You’re nothing but a lowly demon, less than an insect. Beg for your life. I might just spare you.”

“Kill me.”

His resolute response made my eyes gleam. Belphegor let out a hollow laugh, continuing.

“I acknowledge the power you wield. But in front of *them*, you’re nothing but an insect yourself… My revenge will be taken by them. And you’ll meet the same end as me.”

“Who? Your beloved Lilith? Or maybe Astaroth? Satan? Baal? Asmodeus? Lucifer?”

“Ugh… How do you know the names of the veiled lords of the Demon World…?” *Cough!*

As he spoke, I lifted my foot and crouched down. Then, I swung my fist at his mouth. I felt something shatter under my knuckles as fragments of his broken teeth scattered.

“Too bad. Those guys? They’ve all been killed by humans already.”

“No! Don’t lie! They haven’t even descended to the human world yet!”

“Talking back when you can barely speak. Listen, don’t think so highly of those Demon World lords you worship. I’m saying this because I’ve killed them all at least once.”

Belphegor’s face wavered as he stared into my eyes. Demons, habitual liars, had an uncanny ability to discern truth from falsehood. It wasn’t absolute, but deceiving a demon was near impossible. My words, backed by the truth of having killed them in my first cycle, shook him deeply, despite his usual dismissal.

“Im… impossible…”

Yet he still shook his head. Understandable—those demons were only dead in my first cycle. But my words were true, and that truth rattled him.

I widened my eyes mockingly and continued.

“It’s not a lie. Oh, you’re one of Lilith’s lackeys, right? A demon of sloth. Killing Lilith was especially fun. One of the few female demons… it was quite a time. Her body was something else.”

Mentioning Lilith sparked fury in Belphegor’s eyes. It was true they were still alive in this second cycle, and it was also true that I had killed them in the first. Caught in the dissonance of not knowing the full truth, Belphegor let out a guttural growl. I continued in a smooth, taunting voice.

“Know what she did? Stripped naked in front of humans, kneeling, rubbing her hands together, begging for mercy. ‘Please forgive me!’ she cried. She groveled pathetically for her life while her followers died around her.”

“Hraaaagh!!!”

“Even her technique was top-notch. Not only did she take every human there, she shook her hips to entice them… oops.”

“Hraaaagh!!! Hraaaagh!!!”

He screamed and lunged his head at me. I pulled back my hand with a chuckle and slapped his cheek hard. *Slap!* His head whipped to the side with a sharp sound. I grabbed his hair and yanked it up.

His face was already beyond recognition, but I wasn’t much saner myself. A madman talking to a madman. I lifted his head high and slammed it into the ground.

*Boom!*

“Why? Why are you so angry? You’re just like them.”

“Why… why do you hate me so much…?”

His voice was feeble, like air leaking from a balloon, but I understood every word. I lifted his face with a sorrowful expression.

“You really don’t know? Really?”

“What grudge… do you have against me…?”

*Boom!*

I slammed his head down again. He let out a choked scream, his body trembling. I continued in a mournful tone, as if I’d never forgotten those events.

“I remember it clearly. It started when you did that to Da-yeon. Yeah, after that, I wanted to kill you with every fiber of my being. You know, Da-yeon was one of the few kind people who smiled at me back then.”

*Boom!*

“But after what you did to her, after she learned she was pregnant with a demon’s child, she took her own life. That bright, cheerful girl ended her own life.”

*Boom!*

“Burning with vengeance, I chased you. Hyung tried to stop me, but I couldn’t see reason back then. That was probably my first solo mission. But… I fell into the vile trap you set and got captured.”

*Boom!*

“I could endure the humiliation. I was an idiot for getting caught. But you weren’t after me. You rallied every user on your side, summoned all the demon lords you knew, and targeted my brother who came to rescue me.”

*Boom!*

“Yeah, in that battle, my brother died. Even as he fought to save his pathetic younger sibling, sacrificing himself and his comrades, he saved me at the cost of his own life.”

*Boom!*

“Urghhh…”

I paused, gripping Belphegor’s hair tighter. His face was crushed beyond recognition. I spat on it.

“And our bad blood didn’t end there. You, who barely escaped with your life, became a demon duke by the time we met again. And then, you… her…”

Thinking of Han So-yeong unleashed a torrent of emotions I’d kept hidden from everyone. Anger, pain, sorrow, frustration, despair—all the negative emotions surged forth.

“I seized the end. I wished so desperately, so earnestly. But I couldn’t get what I wanted. It was only after listening to the angels that I realized I’d been played by you all. Do you even know? The resolve with which I lived to seize that chance? The despair when I lost all hope just one step away?”

Blood and foam bubbled at Belphegor’s mouth. His face was caked in blood, his proud horns long shattered. Yet he was still alive. Seeing his nostrils flare, I shouted and slammed his face into the ground again.

“Do you know what it’s like to live with that guilt, carrying those memories, writhing in remorse every day?”

“Kek… kek…”

“No? It’s all because of you. If it weren’t for you…”

*Boom!*

“You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you! You damned bastard!”

*Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! BOOM!*

“Kek… krrrr…”

I flung him down roughly and stood up. My breathing was ragged. Possessed by something, I raised my foot over his head again. Savoring the moment, I spoke in a dry voice.

“I’m glad. I’m so glad I met you here. I’m truly grateful I get to kill you here. So let’s end it. This wretched feud between you and me.”

Belphegor could no longer respond. But I didn’t want his answer. And then, I pressed down with all my strength on the foot crushing his head.
