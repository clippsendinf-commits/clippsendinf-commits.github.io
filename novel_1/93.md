# Memorize - Chapter 92 (92/1068): Jackpot, Jackpot, and Another Jackpot

Before examining the last remaining ring, I briefly activated Sol’s user information. I was curious about her progress and wanted to confirm whether the ring was properly bound to her. As her stats appeared, a faint smile crept across my face.

**User Information (Player Status)**  
**Name:** An-sol  
**Abilities** (4 unallocated stat points remaining)  
[Strength 20] [Endurance 22] [Agility 24] [Stamina 30] [Magic 86(+1)] [Luck 100]

Not only was the ring properly bound, but her other stats showed significant growth. Considering her initial stats, aside from Magic and Luck, had hovered in the teens, this was remarkable progress. Reaching 30 points in Stamina was particularly praiseworthy.

“You’ve been working hard, Sol. Looks like you’re being rewarded for it. Congratulations.”

I spoke to An-sol in a bright tone for the first time in a while. If she kept growing like this, she might hit 90 Magic within a year. With even more effort, she could reach the top-tier mage cutoff of 94 within that time. As an aside, in my first playthrough, the user with the highest Magic stat had 101 points—an absurdly overpowered figure. Ignoring that outlier, among known users, three had 98 Magic, and two had 97. To stand a chance in a fight against <Kang>, a mage needed at least 94 Magic.

Sol bowed her head further at my sincere praise, but the faint smile on her lips and the way she fidgeted with the ring showed she was overjoyed. Watching this heartwarming scene, Ha-yeon spoke softly.

“Hehe. Everyone else has gotten something, so it’s only fair the leader takes this ring. You’re not going to refuse this one too, are you?”

“Hmm. Hand it over… What’s that ring?”

Having already activated my Third Eye, I knew its details, but Ha-yeon’s expression practically begged to explain. Her eyes burned with an inexplicable enthusiasm. Acknowledging her fervor, I took a step back and let her speak.

“It’s not as impressive as the Magic-boosting ring, but this one’s plenty valuable too.”

I already knew that, but her deliberate pause made me respond with a deadpan look. Smiling lightly, Ha-yeon placed the ring in my hand.

“Don’t be too shocked. This ring has an Anti-Magic spell imbued in it. And it seems to be the rechargeable kind.”

“Oh, how surprising. An Anti-Magic spell.”

To be precise, it could be used three times a day, recharging once every eight hours. Ha-yeon narrowed her eyes at my textbook-like response.

“…You don’t seem *that* surprised.”

“No, no, I’m plenty shocked. Anyway, we’ve spent enough time here. Let’s continue the exploration.”

Ha-yeon looked slightly dissatisfied, but my words were reasonable, so she reluctantly stood up. The party, now equipped with new gear, eagerly swept up the gold coins and gems scattered on the floor. Having fully cleared the western corridor, it was time to move on. As if reading my mind, Sang-yong turned to me.

“Leader, we’ve checked all the rooms in this corridor. Where to next?”

“North,” I replied simply.

---

At the very end of the northern corridor, we opened the door to the final room. Standing before us was a single creature, drooling profusely.

“Oppa, what’s that thing? I don’t like it,” Yu-jeong said.

“Hmm. Looks like a variant,” I replied.

Her voice was calmer now, a sign of the group’s growing composure. The creature before us had the body of a wolf but sported three heads. Another peculiar feature was the flames it kept spewing from its nostrils and mouth.

“A variant? No way… Cerberus? That’s impossible!” Vivian exclaimed.

“No way. Of course not,” I dismissed firmly.

There was no chance the guardian of Hell, Cerberus, would appear here. The real Cerberus was over three meters tall, wreathed in crimson flames—a truly terrifying beast. If the actual Cerberus saw this variant wolf or heard Vivian’s comment, it would probably shudder with indignation.

Only one variant wolf remained, but scattered wolf bones around the room suggested others had once been here. For some reason, this one was the sole survivor.

“Grrrr…”

Wolves are naturally cunning, but this one felt different—almost too clever. Was it trained in some intelligence program? I let out a wry chuckle at the thought before issuing orders.

“Vivian, you’re on defense. Hyun, Yu-jeong…”

“Raaargh!”

*Whoosh!*

How rude. Before I could finish, the variant wolf launched a surprise attack. The central head opened its maw wide, unleashing a crimson fireball. I heard the hurried chants of shield spells from behind, but I calmly raised my left hand, adorned with the ring.

“Anti-Magic.”

A white light from the ring collided with the fireball in midair, and both dissipated rapidly. The chanting stopped, replaced by gasps of awe and sighs of relief. I continued in a calm tone.

“…stay behind me. Vivian, you know why I put you on defense, right?”

“Yep. Pfft.”

Vivian stifled a laugh, amused by my actions. Her *Block of Fire* spell could easily handle such feeble flames. Honestly, after absorbing the *Essence of Fire*, flames like these barely registered as fire to me.

“After the mages and Sol’s preemptive strike, once its movements are bound, we’ll charge from three sides. I’ll handle the heads. You two flank it and harass it as much as possible.”

“Got it, Oppa.”

“Yes, Hyung.”

“Until then, hold formation. It’s coming. Be careful.”

The wolf seemed startled that its fireball was blocked so easily, but it grew visibly agitated as we casually discussed strategy in its presence. Could it actually understand us? I wanted to check its stats with my Third Eye, but dealing with the charging wolf took priority.

As it barreled toward me, it suddenly veered at the last moment, aiming for Yu-jeong. It must have instinctively targeted her as the weakest. Caught off guard, Yu-jeong’s stance faltered slightly.

“Hah!”

I quickly moved to cover her. Yu-jeong, not one to idle, locked eyes with me and leapt sideways into the air, likely aiming to use her high agility to flank the wolf as she’d done before. It was a decent plan, but…

“Uh…?”

*Whoosh!*

Her jump lacked the necessary force. Rushing without proper preparation, she hadn’t set her stance correctly. To make matters worse, one of the wolf’s heads shot a flame at her midair. Floating helplessly, she’d either be hit by the fire or land in a spot where the wolf could easily counter. I clicked my tongue, about to step in, when—

“Gust of Wind!”

A faint gust swirled around Yu-jeong, pushing her body upward. The timing was impeccable. The fireball missed, slicing through empty air, and Yu-jeong landed safely behind the wolf as planned. The spell not only helped her evade but also boosted her insufficient jump. It was Sang-yong’s handiwork.

“Nice one, Ajusshi!” Yu-jeong cheered.

“I’m not *that* old…” Sang-yong mumbled in response.

Impressive. Really impressive. Sang-yong had often been overshadowed by Ha-yeon, but this move elevated his standing. Not to be outdone, Ha-yeon and Sol unleashed their spell barrage.

“Shackles!”

“Cone of Ice!”

Sol’s binding spell wrapped around the wolf, halting its movements. Immediately after, ice spikes erupted from the ground, piercing its body. Not *Aqua* but *Ice*—Ha-yeon’s water magic was textbook perfect.

“Yelp! Yip! Yip! Yip!”

The wolf thrashed, barking wildly, but the binding held, causing the ice spikes to dig deeper with each struggle. Ha-yeon, a skilled mage adept at high-speed chanting and double-casting, wasn’t done. Her lips parted again.

“Broken!”

*Crack! Shatter!*

At Ha-yeon’s command, the ice spikes embedded in the wolf shattered, scattering fragments outward. The dazzling display drew gasps from Hyun and Yu-jeong. Already in pain from the piercing, the wolf now had the ice exploding inside it. Its three heads writhed, foaming at the mouth.

“Keeeeng…”

“You bastard! Thought you could target me? Take that!” Yu-jeong shouted, clearly still pissed from earlier.

Gripping her daggers tightly, she charged. Thanks to Sol’s boosted Magic, the binding spell held strong, giving Yu-jeong free rein to attack. Watching her stab and slash like she was pounding a drum, I let out a low hum.

“Hahahahaha!”

Yu-jeong’s maniacal laughter echoed as she intensified her assault. The wolf’s state was pitiful. It tried desperately to turn, but a long spear put an end to its efforts.

“Hup!”

“Kek!”

With a sharp inhale, Hyun thrust his spear into one of the heads’ mouths, killing it instantly. The remaining two heads whimpered, but the group showed no mercy, whittling down the wolf’s life. Unable to watch any longer, I dashed forward and sliced off the remaining heads in one stroke.

Poor thing. It was almost pitiable. As the wolf’s body collapsed with a serene expression, I sighed. Yu-jeong, still fuming, clashed her daggers together in the air, blood dripping from them. The clear sound of metal rang out.

Finally calming down, she turned to me with a bright smile, blood splattered across her body. The rest of the party instinctively took a step back.

“Oppa, I did good, right?”

“…Yeah. You did well.”

“Heehee! I got praised!”

I gave Yu-jeong rare praise. Typically, novice female melee users struggled to adapt so quickly. Many, especially those treated like princesses in the modern world, hesitated to kill even animals, let alone monsters. Even some User Academy graduates showed reluctance. But Yu-jeong defied that stereotype, displaying the ferocity of a true berserker. Wiping blood off herself without a care, I wondered if I should be impressed or concerned. Still, in this moment, she looked endearing. I gently reached out and wiped some blood from her cheek.

As I cleaned her face, Yu-jeong’s eyes widened, then closed softly, savoring the touch.
