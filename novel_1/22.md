# Memorize - Episode 21 (21/1068)

# 잠시, 헤어지다 / A Brief Parting

Through the window, the sky was filled with dark clouds drifting heavily. A faint mist lingered in the air, not thick but noticeable, and a light drizzle fell intermittently. Watching the raindrops tap against the glass, Kim Han-byeol felt a calm settle over her.

It wasn’t exactly cozy, but it was a comforting feeling nonetheless. Though it might seem sentimental given their situation, it was far better than the dread of being chased by strange creatures in the forest or the tense moments inside it. 

*Come to think of it… I used to love rainy days when I was younger.*

Kim Han-byeol had always liked rainy days since childhood. Walking through the rain-soaked streets with an umbrella, listening to music, was a small joy in an otherwise mundane routine. Suddenly, she craved a cup of coffee. A hot, delicious cup of coffee to warm her insides felt like it could make her forget, even for a moment, the chaos surrounding her.

With a wistful expression, Kim Han-byeol gazed at the world reflected through the window. The gray shadows creeping over her signaled that evening had arrived. After everything she’d endured today, both her body and mind were steeped in exhaustion. Rubbing her sleepy eyes, she turned her head. A large room, about 20 pyeong in size, came into view. It had everything they needed: food, water, bedding, a bathroom, even a shower.

They had fled in a frenzy and stumbled upon a city. Upon entering, Kim Han-byeol had felt an odd sense of unease. The city was eerily quiet, as if no one lived there. At first, she thought it might be a ghost town. Amidst this, they found a medium-sized building with a black-painted rooftop that stood out to the group. Whether it was luck or something guiding them, the building was surprisingly well-equipped with necessities.

Her body and mind screamed for rest, but the situation wasn’t quite safe enough to sleep. An-sol was still unconscious, struggling to regain her senses, and An-hyeon was preoccupied with tending to her. And as for Lee Yu-jeong…

Following Lee Yu-jeong’s trail, Kim Han-byeol easily spotted her. At some point, she had picked up the sword Kim Han-byeol had carefully placed by the front door. Guessing her intentions, Kim Han-byeol let out a soft sigh and spoke.

“Unni.”

“Yeah?”

“Put the sword down.”

“No way.”

Lee Yu-jeong ignored her, unlocking the front door. The loud *click* of the lock startled An-hyeon, who flung open the room’s door and stepped out. Seeing the sword in Lee Yu-jeong’s hand, he immediately frowned.

“It’s pointless. Put the sword down and wait quietly,” Kim Han-byeol said.

At her words, Lee Yu-jeong shot her a resentful glare.

“Why?”

“…”

“I’m going to bring Su-hyeon oppa back, so you guys just wait here.”

*Oppa. Su-hyeon oppa.*

Kim Han-byeol quietly repeated his name in her mind. From the moment she met Kim Su-hyeon, she had sensed they were similar in some way. From their first encounter in the clearing, he gave off a unique aura—always calm, confident in his voice, with steady eyes. That’s why, on the hill, she had been drawn to his words and trusted his judgment. After staring at Lee Yu-jeong for a moment, Kim Han-byeol continued.

“You’re not the only one worried about him, unni. But even if you go, there’s nothing you can do. Waiting here quietly is the best way to help.”

“He might still be waiting out there! I’m saying it again—if you’re not going, stay out of it. If you guys won’t go, I’ll go get him myself.”

“Yu-jeong, Han-byeol’s right. Put the sword down,” An-hyeon said sternly.

At his firm tone, Lee Yu-jeong whipped her head around. After sneering at both An-hyeon and Kim Han-byeol, she continued in a mocking voice.

“You guys are unbelievable. Oppa could be out there, wandering around looking for us, and you’re just sitting here?”

*You guys are unbelievable.* Her words carried layers of meaning, stinging everyone in the room. An-hyeon pressed his lips shut, but Kim Han-byeol didn’t stay silent. Glancing at An-sol, still lying unconscious in the next room, she spoke.

“We had no choice. Those things were charging at us, and we were all in danger. If it weren’t for her, we might all be dead right now.”

“Who doesn’t know that? That’s why we escaped and brought Sol here. So what, now that we’re safe, it’s over? Oppa’s supposed to just find his way here on his own?”

Kim Han-byeol’s stomach churned at Lee Yu-jeong’s sarcastic tone. The shouting and casual speech grated on her nerves. Without realizing it, she smirked coldly and responded.

“Then go. Go out and search to your heart’s content. I don’t care if you die out there.”

She regretted the words the moment they left her mouth, but it was too late. An-hyeon looked at her in shock, while Lee Yu-jeong, stunned, let out a hollow laugh.

“You… you’re really something, huh? So this is who oppa sacrificed himself for? I’m disappointed. Was all that concern earlier just an act?”

“I told him not to go. He’s the one who insisted. Why are you blaming me?”

“You… ugh, forget it. You’re not even worth talking to, you cold-blooded trash.”

Kim Han-byeol had expected Lee Yu-jeong to yell and charge at her, but her dismissive attitude and calling her “trash” cut deep into her pride. Unbeknownst to her, her breathing had grown rougher, and her voice now carried a trace of indignation.

“You’re being harsh. Was anything I said wrong?”

“I don’t care. I just don’t want to live like a hypocrite like you.”

“Are you done?”

“You’re glaring at me like that, huh? What, you want to pull my hair or something? Don’t bother. If you don’t want a scratch on that pretty little face, just shut your mouth.”

“Both of you, stop it!”

Unable to stand their escalating argument, An-hyeon shouted angrily, his voice silencing them both. He glared at them with sunken eyes before holding out his hand to Lee Yu-jeong.

“Give it to me.”

“…No.”

Seeing Lee Yu-jeong clutch the sword tightly, An-hyeon sighed deeply and spoke in a softer, weary tone.

“I’ll go look for hyung. You’re right, now that I think about it.”

“…Really? Then let’s go together.”

Lee Yu-jeong’s expression softened, a mix of hesitation and relief, but An-hyeon shook his head weakly.

“No, it’s easier if I go alone. Those things might still be out there. You and Han-byeol stay here and look after Sol.”

“With *her*? No way. I don’t trust her anymore.”

Kim Han-byeol felt something surge inside her at Lee Yu-jeong’s continued attacks. She had been holding back, but her patience finally snapped. Yet, as someone who prided herself on her cool-headedness, her anger didn’t erupt into shouts like Lee Yu-jeong’s. Instead, her voice grew icy and mocking as she turned to An-hyeon.

“Don’t go. If you do, you’ll definitely get yourself killed.”

“Will you shut up?”

“You shut up.”

“What? Say that again.”

As Lee Yu-jeong glared, looking ready to swing, An-hyeon quickly snatched the sword from her grasp. But Kim Han-byeol, now fully committed, let her words spill out like a dam bursting.

“Don’t act like you know everything! If it weren’t for her, what do you think would’ve happened to us? Didn’t you see those things? Swords and fists didn’t work! It’s obvious you’ll die if you go, so why are you so insistent?”

“You little—”

“No comeback, so you resort to cursing? Do you even know where oppa is to go get him? If you’ve got a brain, use it.”

“Nice excuse. Showing your true colors now, huh? Don’t you remember we’re here because of oppa? You’re just a leech, hiding behind your fake concern while scheming to use others. You’re worse than that guy.”

Comparing her to a troublemaker—and worse—made Kim Han-byeol’s face twist in anger for the first time. Her voice trembled with fury as she raised her tone.

“The dead are dead! What’s wrong with the living trying to survive?!”

Her words were like a spark. Lee Yu-jeong shoved An-hyeon aside and lunged at her. Kim Han-byeol gritted her teeth, raising her hand to slap her, when—

*Bang.*

“What’s going on? Why’s it so noisy?”

The unlocked front door swung open, and a young man stepped inside. A calm face, a confident voice, steady eyes, and a crossbow strapped to his left arm. Everyone in the room froze, their breaths catching. The tense atmosphere, which had reached its peak, vanished like a lie.

“I’m glad you’re all safe.”

With a gentle smile, he unstrapped the crossbow from his left arm and raised his right hand in greeting.

It was Kim Su-hyeon.
