# Memorize - Chapter 110: Same Question, Different Result

“Rare Class? Energy SpearMan?”

Yujeong repeated my words, her eyes widening as she let out a sharp breath. The reactions from the rest of the party were similar. In a way, their excitement seemed even greater than when I revealed my own Secret Class. I had earned some respect with my demonstrated skills, but An-hyeon hadn’t shown much prowess until this moment of his class advancement, which likely amplified their reactions.

“No way! Why does only An-hyeon get something like that…!”

“This caravan must be blessed by the Goddess of Luck! Truly…”

“Shh.”

I furrowed my brow slightly and pressed my index finger to my lips, signaling silence. Yujeong, who had been grumbling, and Shin Sang-yong, who had let out an exclamation, immediately shut their mouths. Meanwhile, An-hyeon was trembling uncontrollably, his lips tightly pressed together. His body was struggling under the strain of accepting power far beyond his current mana capacity.

But this was undoubtedly a positive sign. For a Year 0 User, whose abilities and stats were still underdeveloped, evolving into such a high-tier class was nothing short of a miraculous opportunity. The infusion of immense, pre-set power into an unrefined body would naturally elevate his capabilities to a certain degree.

“It’s rare, but class advancement is a critical process. It’s already tough for him, and a noisy environment might make it harder to focus. Let’s hold off on questions until the inheritance is complete. It shouldn’t take too long.”

At my words, the group audibly swallowed. Yujeong, in particular, was gulping loudly, her eyes fixed on An-hyeon with an expression brimming with envy. I gently stroked the Magic Sword Skrep in my arms before turning my attention back to An-hyeon.

“Ugh… uhh… ah…”

An-hyeon was diligently following my instructions. Though his body shook like a leaf in the wind, he gripped the Black Spear tightly, showing his resolve not to let go. Silently cheering him on, I wrapped an arm gently around Yujeong’s shoulders. After hearing her inner thoughts earlier today, I felt a pang of guilt for being a bit harsh with her. I resolved to be kinder and more supportive going forward.

“Hmph… Oppa…”

Yujeong pouted and nestled her head against my shoulder. An-sol was too engrossed in watching her brother to notice. I stroked Yujeong’s soft hair, keeping a close eye on An-hyeon’s every movement.

Soon, I noticed An-hyeon’s trembling begin to subside. He started breathing more steadily and glancing around, indicating the process was nearing its end. The moment his arms, still clutching the spear, went limp, a golden light enveloped his entire body.

“Success.”

Satisfied, I spoke as the golden light swirled vibrantly around An-hyeon before quickly fading. When he emerged, he stared blankly into space, as if in disbelief—likely checking his User Information. Curiosity piqued, I activated my Third Eye to take a look.

Reading An-hyeon’s User Information in detail, I couldn’t help but marvel inwardly. This was a remarkable transformation. His class and true name had changed, as expected, but the shifts in alignment, stats, and the awakening of special and potential abilities were top-tier.

Originally, An-hyeon’s alignment was True · Neutral, but it had shifted to the more benevolent Amity · Moderation, likely influenced by his recent actions. That wasn’t all—his stats had increased significantly: Strength +2, Endurance +1, Stamina +2, and Mana +9, for a total of 14 points. Achieving double-digit stat growth in less than two months since arriving in Mul was extraordinary, even accounting for the boost from his Rare Class advancement.

Then there were his abilities: Master of Spear Arts and Protective Aura. Awakening both a special and a potential ability in less than six months was impressive enough, but Master of Spear Arts started at C-rank, and Protective Aura, though lower-ranked, was a top-tier defensive ability capable of blocking both physical and magical attacks. He was starting with incredible advantages.

I wanted to call it unfair, but my conscience stopped me—after all, my own EX-rank Mind and Sword as One could overshadow all of An-hyeon’s current achievements. So, I set aside any shameless thoughts and decided to sincerely celebrate his growth.

“Hyung.”

“…Congratulations.”

An-hyeon looked at me with a dreamy expression. I smiled brightly, congratulating him, but he staggered toward me, still dazed. Understanding that his joy might be overwhelming, I patted his shoulder as he approached. Then, suddenly, he lunged at me.

“Hyung!!!!”

This wasn’t the first time An-hyeon had done this, and I was ready. With a calm smile, I stepped back, preparing to give him a swift kick as he came closer.

“Let’s tally up all the items we obtained from the Ruined Laboratory.”

It was probably dark outside by now. Nights in the Hall Plane were best avoided. The journey from the Ruined Laboratory to Mul took three days, and while camping was unavoidable, venturing out at night was something to steer clear of. Starting early tomorrow morning and pushing hard would be safer. Truthfully, my body wasn’t fully recovered yet, and I wanted some time to rest.

Since we were staying the night, I decided to organize the items we’d acquired. This expedition had been an absolute jackpot. Including the gear the group was currently equipped with, our haul was staggering.

First, the monetary gains: 480 gold coins and eight large ruby gems, each worth 100 gold, totaling 1,280 gold in profit.

Next, the equipment: a mithril bracelet that enhances mana flow for An-hyeon; a decorative dagger with a small amount of mithril for Yujeong; a cloak named Block of Fire for Vivian; a ring that boosts mana by 1 point for An-sol; and a ring for me that can cast Anti-Magic three times.

Then, from defeating the Demon Earl Belphegor, we obtained the Demon’s Heart and the Magic Sword Skrep.

Finally, from the secret room: the Black Spear (triggering An-hyeon’s Rare Class advancement), a stamina-boosting elixir, the Records of the Ancient Spear Master, the Gloves of Reduction, a pendant found in a pouch, and a necklace discovered by Jeong Ha-yeon.

Jeong Ha-yeon, having cast restoration magic on most of the items, tilted her head as she handed me the pendant and necklace. I had already checked their details with my Third Eye, but I patiently listened to her explanation.

“…The necklace makes sense, but the pendant doesn’t seem special. The necklace is a very good item. It seems to have a strengthened version of the now-lost Memorize magic from the Hall Plane, or something similar, permanently enchanted. It can store two spells, which can be cast instantly by speaking the activation word. However, it can’t store divine spells—it’s strictly for magic users.”

Known as the Glory Necklace, it was indeed enchanted with the lost Memorize magic, as Jeong Ha-yeon described. While it was an excellent item, it paled in comparison to An-hyeon’s Rare Class advancement, so her expression remained calm.

The pendant, however, was just that—a pendant, utterly useless. I wanted to crush it underfoot, but seeing An-sol’s anxious expression stopped me. I decided to toss it later when she wasn’t looking and shoved it into a corner for now.

“Heh heh heh.”

An-hyeon was grinning ear to ear, occasionally glancing at me with the starry-eyed look of a lovesick boy. Each time, I pointed to my foot, signaling that I’d kick him if he tried anything. Still, I planned to distribute some of the new items now. The group watched me eagerly, hanging on my every move.

I started with An-hyeon, pulling out the Gloves of Reduction and the Records.

“An-hyeon, that spear feels a bit heavy, doesn’t it?”

“Heh heh heh. It’s much heavier than the one I used before.”

Sighing at his constant grinning, I tossed him the gloves and the records.

“As Jeong Ha-yeon explained, the gloves reduce the weight of whatever you’re holding. They don’t actually increase your strength, just lighten the load, so keep that in mind. The records are in an ancient language, likely related to your spear training. Ask Vivian to decipher them when we get back to the city.”

“I pledge my loyalty!”

I gave An-hyeon a withering look as he gleefully gathered his assigned items. The elixir wasn’t something I could use myself, so I planned to give it to someone at the right moment. My eyes fell on Shin Sang-yong, who was gazing enviously at An-hyeon, and Vivian, sitting with a blank expression. A sudden idea sparked in my mind.

The elixir, Vivian’s purified spirit essence, the Demon’s Heart, the Harmony Magic Circle, and an alchemist… Perhaps…

“Hyung!”

“…Stop it already.”

I kicked An-hyeon away as he lunged at me again, shaking my head. I had pieced together a puzzle in my mind, but it wasn’t my area of expertise, so I couldn’t be certain of success.

I decided to hold onto the Glory Necklace and the pendant for now. I had considered giving them to Vivian, but she declined, as her beast summoning magic didn’t suit the necklace. Honestly, I agreed—it was better suited for Jeong Ha-yeon. But I wouldn’t give it to her yet. That would come after we returned to Mul and sorted out our relationship.

“Tch. Getting all excited by himself… It’s like that room was made just for him.”

As I ordered us to set up camp, Yujeong’s grumbling voice reached my ears. She was pouting, clearly bursting with jealousy. I thought of the Magic Sword Skrep in my possession, but it wasn’t the right time to give it to her. It was a dangerous magic sword, and I needed to tame it fully before handing it over. Still, seeing Yujeong’s slumped shoulders tugged at my heart. Since I’d promised to be more attentive, I decided to cheer her up personally later.

Though we were underground, reducing the risk of attack, I set up a watch just in case. An-hyeon, usually sluggish during camp setup, moved with unprecedented speed today. Despite his usual reserved demeanor, this lively side of him made me think he was still young. Yujeong, annoyed by his behavior, sniped at him, but An-hyeon, in high spirits, responded with a warm smile.

“Hmm… Vivian? Come here.”

“Huh? Why?”

It was rare for An-hyeon to call Vivian, so she tilted her head in curiosity. In front of Yujeong, he spoke in an unusually gentle tone.

“Let’s get along as fellow Rare Class holders. Come on, spread your sleeping bag next to mine. Leave a spot in the middle for our Secret Class leader, Hyung.”

An-sol stared at An-hyeon in disbelief. She wasn’t alone—Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong looked equally stunned by the exchange. I was inwardly embarrassed but wanted to let An-hyeon enjoy his moment.

What followed was predictable: Yujeong launched herself at An-hyeon. After some minor chaos, we settled down, ate dinner, and decided to sleep early since we’d be leaving at dawn. As I slipped into my sleeping bag, watching Vivian take the first watch, I thought about our return to Mul tomorrow. It hadn’t been an easy journey, but we’d gained so much. With that final thought, I closed my eyes calmly.
