# Memorize - Chapter 26: A Meeting with Acquaintances

Among the monsters appearing in the Rite of Passage, there’s a creature called a Mangi, which closely resembles a monkey. Unlike Deadmen, it’s fair to classify them as proper monsters. Their bodies are covered in soft, fluffy fur, offering no defensive strength, but their behavior is extremely cunning, and they typically move in groups of at least four or five. This makes them particularly troublesome for novice Users to face alone.

“Ookie! Ookie-ki!”

Right now, we were engaged in combat with five human-sized Mangis. Despite their considerable strength, these heavy-bodied, long-tailed creatures were sluggish. They could leap high and slam down abruptly, but predicting their landing spot and dodging posed little danger.

“Ookie-ki! Ookie-ki!”

“Be careful!”

An-hyeon and Kim Han-byeol were currently locked in a tough fight against three Mangis. I was holding off one, and Lee Yu-jeong was dealing with another, putting us at a numerical disadvantage. But only numerically.

Just then, amid the intense back-and-forth, I noticed one of the Mangis fighting An-hyeon subtly slip backward and crouch. It seemed to be targeting me. Normally, it would make sense for it to go after Lee Yu-jeong, who was struggling, but these creatures rarely targeted women due to their nature. Driven by a strong desire for mating and an obsession with reproduction, Mangis went into a frenzy at the sight of female beings—especially fairies (though I personally think it’s far-fetched for Mangis to catch fairies) or human women. They likely planned to take down the men first and then abduct the women.

“Hyung! Yu-jeong! Watch out! One of them’s gone missing!” An-hyeon shouted loudly.

While fending off three Mangis, he seemed to have gained some breathing room as one slipped away. To be distracted in a life-or-death battle while still a novice—impressive in its own way. Hearing An-hyeon’s warning, Lee Yu-jeong shifted to a more defensive stance. Already struggling against one Mangi, the thought of facing two made her instinctively shrink back. At that moment, the crouching Mangi let out a roar and leaped high into the air. That was the moment I’d been waiting for.

*Ping!*

Without hesitation, I drew my crossbow string. The arrow, slicing through the air with a sharp whistle, pierced the Mangi’s head cleanly. Using the force of its descent was clever, but it hadn’t considered that it couldn’t maneuver mid-air. Or perhaps it didn’t expect me to hit it. I was going easy to let the others practice, but if I got serious…

*Ugh, what’s the point of saying it?*

“Oppa! Watch your side!”

I know, I know. While I was aiming at the airborne Mangi, another charged at me from the side, slamming its palm down as if to crush me. Without even looking, I sidestepped with the precision of a single sheet of paper, then drove the arrow in my right hand into its head. A clean counterattack. I felt the soft flesh give way under the arrow’s tip.

“Kieee…”

*Thud!*

The Mangi let out a pitiful cry as it collapsed. At the same time, the body of the airborne Mangi crashed to the ground. Two down in just three seconds. Quickly reloading my crossbow, I surveyed the battlefield. Everyone seemed to be holding their own.

An-hyeon was fighting with his longsword and shield, as he had from the start. Kim Han-byeol wielded a slightly thinner but longer blade, swinging it awkwardly but effectively. Lee Yu-jeong, brandishing two sharpened daggers, was going wild. It looked like An-hyeon was holding off two Mangis with his sword and shield, creating openings for Kim Han-byeol to strike. When a solid hit landed, they’d combine for a swift joint attack. Their teamwork, though rough, was yielding decent results. Lee Yu-jeong, however, was struggling to close the distance due to her weapons’ short reach. She occasionally scratched a Mangi’s arm but kept retreating, swinging her daggers futilely in the air.

They’d only been wielding weapons for three or four days, so expecting more would be unreasonable. Still, their ability to adapt to the Rite of Passage at such a remarkable pace proved they were high-caliber Users. With a soft sigh, I aimed my crossbow at the Mangi Lee Yu-jeong was facing. I didn’t intend to kill it—just create an opening, like last time.

*Ping!*

“Kieee!”

The arrow struck the Mangi’s right chest. Unlike Deadmen, which felt no pain, the Mangi staggered, screaming in agony. Lee Yu-jeong didn’t miss her chance. Her eyes gleamed at the sight of the arrow, and she swiftly ducked low, darting in. Her base Agility stat of 50 points shone brilliantly in that moment.

“Die, you filthy rapist monkey!”

Spitting out a colorful curse, Lee Yu-jeong crossed her daggers with the ferocity of facing a lifelong enemy. At the same time, I heard An-hyeon’s battle cry from the side, signaling he’d landed a decisive blow.

One second, two seconds, three seconds, four seconds, five seconds. After counting to five, I looked at the Mangis the group had been fighting. They lay defeated, sprawled on the ground in pitiful states. The Mangi Lee Yu-jeong fought bore a large X-shaped gash across its chest. The ones An-hyeon and Kim Han-byeol faced had one large wound and multiple smaller cuts, respectively. They’d steadily chipped away at the Mangis’ stamina before delivering fatal blows. *Ah, this must be the joy of mentoring.*

The three of them noticed the two Mangis I’d already taken down, shook their heads, and slumped to the ground, panting heavily. They must have been on edge—usually, they faced one monster at a time, but today it was five, so it was understandably exhausting.

“Ugh… damn it. I’m covered in monkey blood. This is gross,” Lee Yu-jeong grumbled, shaking her short hair to flick off the blood and spitting on the ground.

Drenched in blood and sprawled on the ground, she looked both fierce and strangely beautiful, like a goddess of war. An-hyeon and Kim Han-byeol weren’t much better off, with torn clothes and dried bloodstains scattered across their bodies. An-sol and I were probably in the best shape.

I closed my eyes, sinking into thought.

Three days had passed since we left the city. Including the first day, we’d been surviving for four days, and today was the fifth. If we maintained this pace, we might reach the Warp Gate by the sixth day—or the seventh at the latest.

The past five days had been both monotonous and thrilling. We walked, fought, rested, walked, fought, and rested again. In our first encounter after leaving the city, a Mandragora nearly cost us An-sol. It had burst from the ground, mouth agape, ready to swallow her whole, startling everyone except me into a panic. An-hyeon, recklessly charging in, got scratched by its thorns but was fortunate I’d sensed it early and reacted quickly.

That incident seemed to awaken something in Kim Han-byeol and Lee Yu-jeong. At the next Save Point, they grabbed weapons and declared they’d fight too. An-hyeon was hesitant about letting the girls fight, but their resolve was firm. Whether it was unease at leaving combat to just An-hyeon and me or a genuine desire to help, I wasn’t sure. What I did know was the fierce will to survive burning in their eyes. Since I’d been planning to train them anyway, I nodded in agreement.

After leaving the Save Point and passing through the forest, we encountered a lone figure at the edge of the Mangi-infested area—a female User. She was strikingly beautiful, but by the time we found her, she was already a corpse. Her clothes were nearly torn off, her body covered in red bruises, and warm, white fluid still trickled from her lower body, suggesting she’d been assaulted by Mangis until moments before our arrival. A trail of blood from her mouth indicated she’d taken her own life, unable to endure.

Lee Yu-jeong went berserk at the sight, screaming to slaughter the “monkey bastards.” Whether by coincidence or not, we soon spotted five Mangis with engorged members nearby and dove into battle. Truthfully, Lee Yu-jeong’s loud outburst had likely drawn their attention. Having just finished with one female and finding her dead, they must have caught the scent of new women and charged in, too excited to pass us by.

The result was our victory. Deciding to move forward steadily, I pulled myself from my thoughts.

“Sol, pass me a towel and a bottle of water,” Lee Yu-jeong said.

“What did you say?” Kim Han-byeol snapped, catching her slip.

“Oh, sorry! I’m exhausted and messed up. Not ‘Han-byeol,’ a *bottle*.”

“Pfft… here you go, Unni. You worked hard.”

“Worked hard, my ass. How the hell does Oppa take out these monkeys so easily? Give me that crossbow! I wanna use it!”

I gave an awkward smile at Lee Yu-jeong’s whining. *If you’re jealous, get stronger.* I didn’t say it out loud, of course—*I had to crawl through the dirt alone, swinging a sword with no one to help me.* Instead, I just kept the awkward smile.

They were starting to notice something different about me as they gained experience wielding weapons. Kim Han-byeol sat quietly, catching her breath, but An-hyeon, panting heavily, kept his eyes fixed on me.

“Hyung, were you in some special forces or something? How do you shoot a crossbow *that* well?”

“…They teach you that stuff in the army these days.”

“Come on, Oppa, don’t lie. Shooting a gun, maybe, but who learns to use a crossbow?”

“Says the guy who’s never been to Seoul but thinks he’s hot stuff. Go enlist and then talk. You think the army’s just about shooting guns? They train you in bayonet techniques, taekwondo, dagger skills, throwing stars, bows, and crossbows—it’s all basic combat training.”

My words left An-hyeon, Lee Yu-jeong, and An-sol looking puzzled. Only Kim Han-byeol smirked, catching that I was bluffing. I wasn’t worried. Our team was solid, and showing a bit of skill was within acceptable limits.

“Ugh, whatever. I’m done thinking. My head hurts. I just wanna rest,” Lee Yu-jeong groaned.

“If you’re resting, sit up or stand. What if we get ambushed lying down like that?”

“Don’t care, don’t care, don’t care! Sol, sorry, but can you grab me a chocolate? I’m starving.”

“Sol, get me one too,” An-hyeon added.

“Me too, please,” Kim Han-byeol chimed in.

“Okay~! Coming right up~!” An-sol replied cheerfully, moving quickly to fulfill their requests.

At An-hyeon’s insistence, we’d restricted An-sol from direct combat, but she was happy to assist in other ways. Helping others seemed to suit her, and she didn’t seem to mind these small tasks, so I let it slide. Watching her hand out water bottles with a bright smile, I sat down slowly.

Humans are remarkably adaptable, especially when survival is at stake. The synergy of environment and instinct is powerful. I felt that truth keenly. These women, who just days ago were living ordinary lives, were now swinging blades at monsters with growing familiarity. Thinking back to how I trembled after killing my first living creature, I couldn’t help but give a wry smile.

Still, there were concerns. They could wield weapons against monsters threatening their lives without hesitation, but what if the enemy was human? Could they act as decisively? I wanted to train them for that scenario too, but the opportunity hadn’t arisen.

“Hey, let’s get moving. If we keep up the pace, we might spot a yellow roof today. That okay, Hyung?”

“Yeah,” I replied simply.

A Rest Room, huh? They’d get harder to find closer to the Central Gate. I didn’t voice it, though, and just nodded. Lee Yu-jeong, her frustration easing, nodded back. As everyone brushed off the dirt and began to stand, I started to rise too, organizing my thoughts. I’d turned off my mana detection for their training, but I froze as I sensed several presences nearby.

The moment I heard rustling in the bushes and turned my head, a voice rang out.

“Hey, who are these guys?”

In that instant, my group and I saw four people emerge from the dense foliage.
