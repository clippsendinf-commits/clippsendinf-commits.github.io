# Memorize - Chapter 68 (68/1068) - Vivian La Clarté

As Vivian had said, it didn’t take long to reach the workshop. After exiting the passage and crawling a bit further, another passage came into view. This one was distinctly different from the ones I’d seen before. Passing through it and venturing deeper, I soon found myself standing before the alchemist’s workshop.

The workshop was a treasure trove of curiosities. Scattered documents and records, monster corpses, glass vials emitting strange vapors, and liquids of all kinds filled the space. In one corner, two cocoons tightly wrapped in white silk sat alone. They were likely the two users we had captured earlier.

Vivian asked me to wait for a moment before gently setting me down on the floor. Ever since begging for her life, she had been cautious with every action. Leaving me to look around the workshop, she began moving about busily.

After rummaging around for a while, Vivian started piling items neatly in front of me. She was moving with such fervor that anyone watching might think, “She’s really putting in a lot of effort.” As she dropped a final, worn-out square box in front of me, I seriously considered whether I should let her live.

Wiping the sweat from her face with one of her long legs, Vivian cautiously gauged my reaction before speaking. Given how quickly her mood seemed to shift, I couldn’t be sure when she might turn on me again. With full alertness in my mind, I listened to her words.

“Phew! I’ve brought everything out. There’s more, but I doubt you’d like them. Anyway, I’ve gathered everything that seems useful by human standards. I hope you like it!”

I shook my head at her giggling. Once a renowned alchemist, how could her intelligence have degraded so much? Or rather, looking at our current dynamic, the roles of master and guest had completely reversed. By all accounts, I was the intruder—practically a thief—yet here she was, offering me her possessions willingly.

Well, the desire to survive trumps everything. Accepting this awkward situation, I picked up the large leather pouch on the far left. It felt heavy, bulging with contents that seemed to be packed full. The quantity was satisfactory. I untied the string sealing the pouch and peered inside. This was…

“Gems?”

“Yohohoho! Yup. Don’t humans generally love gems? I used to be human myself, you know, and I loved shiny things back then. Anyway, those are all high-quality picks. That one pouch alone should keep you set for a while, don’t you think? So, what do you think? Like it?”

“Hmm.”

Vivian, unable to shake her unease, kept sneaking glances at my face as she spoke. As she rambled about the value of the gems, I slowly nodded. She wasn’t wrong. The value of the gems in the pouch was undeniably significant.

Swallowing hard, I nodded again. The pouch was brimming with gems that radiated a brilliant sheen. At a glance, I could see amethysts, aquamarines, diamonds, emeralds, rubies, opals, topazes, and more. Their dazzling luster confirmed they were of the highest quality.

In the Hall Plane, gems were popular not just for decoration but even more so among mages, who found them useful for their craft. Suddenly, the face of Kim Han-byeol, a Secret Class Jewel Mage, flashed in my mind. Since her magic relied heavily on gems, this pouch would have been incredibly helpful to her.

But I quickly dismissed the thought of Han-byeol. In the end, she had kicked away her own fortune. I understood her feelings, but if the future didn’t change, the dissolution of the Golden Lion Clan was a foregone conclusion.

Seeing my satisfied smile, Vivian’s face lit up.

“Not bad. I almost feel bad taking them.”

“Ehehe! Oh, come on. Nothing’s more precious than life. Besides, I don’t really have much use for them.”

Her obsession with survival was intense. Regardless, I set the gem pouch aside and picked up another leather pouch nearby. As I lifted it, a jingling sound suggested it was filled with gold coins. This pouch, too, was plump. Peering inside, I saw, as expected, gleaming gold coins.

“Hmm. Gold coins, huh? Looks like about 200 Gold. Is this all you’ve got?”

As I toyed with the pouch, tossing and catching it to gauge its weight, I got a rough estimate of the amount. It wasn’t a small sum, but the gems had been so impressive that I felt a slight twinge of disappointment. Sensing my mood, Vivian fidgeted nervously with her legs. With a dejected voice, she spoke.

“S-Sorry… It’s exactly 204 Gold, 27 Silver, and 306 Bronze. I wasn’t that greedy about gold, you know. I scraped together everything I had, but… ugh, that’s really all there is. I’m sorry. Really sorry. If I’d known, I would’ve saved more… Please forgive me.”

As she spoke, Vivian’s voice trembled, and a single tear rolled down her face. Startled, I hurriedly tried to comfort the giant spider.

“No, no, it’s fine! Really, it’s okay. Come on, don’t cry. Lift your head.”

An intruder who came to raid the dungeon was now consoling its master, who was bowing and begging for forgiveness. Even in the Hall Plane, this was a rare sight. Feeling like a thug extorting her, I broke into a sweat as I tried to soothe Vivian.

At my words, Vivian nodded and wiped her tears with her leg. …I just couldn’t get used to this. Placing the coin pouch neatly beside the gems, Vivian pointed to the next one with a determined expression. This one was three or four times larger than the previous pouches, almost like a sack.

“T-This one! You’ll definitely like this one!”

“Y-Yeah, okay, okay. I’ll check it out now. Thanks, really.”

“Yep. Take a look! Heehee.”

Vivian started to untie the pouch herself but stopped when she saw her own legs, pouting slightly. I opened the sack she pushed toward me and checked its contents. Her confidence piqued my curiosity about what was inside.

The sack contained glass vials filled with liquids of various colors. They were likely potions she had crafted herself. Looking at the neatly arranged potions, I immediately activated my Third Eye. As I stared at the sack, I heard Vivian clear her throat.

“Ahem. See those potions? Ahem! Let me tell you what kinds they are.”

“There’s some high-grade healing water… Hmm, no top-grade ones, that’s a shame. Mana recovery potions too… Poison, huh. This could be useful. Antidote potions—well, if you’ve got poison, you’d need antidotes too. Oh? Explosive potions? These are nice. And… huh? A lust potion?”

Muttering the information revealed by my Third Eye, I noticed Vivian’s voice cut off mid-sentence. When I looked up, I saw a spider staring at me with a stunned expression. Why was she looking at me like that? Still, the items she’d offered were decent, and I was in a fairly good mood. I spoke to her gently.

“What’s wrong?”

“Are you… an alchemist? Weren’t you a swordsman?”

“Huh? No, I’m not an alchemist. Why do you ask?”

“Oh? Uh, no, it’s just… Never mind.”

I tilted my head as she tightly closed her eyes. Oh, maybe she was about to proudly explain the potions when I preempted her, making her feel deflated. Feeling a bit guilty, I smacked my lips. Patting her leg to encourage her, I mentally tallied the three pouches I’d received.

The gold coins weren’t that significant since I already had a reserve of 1,000 Gold. But the gem pouch and the potion set were a jackpot. The gems could be saved for recruiting a talented mage later or used to craft various weapons. The potions were a no-brainer—there’d be countless uses for them in the Hall Plane. With a pleased heart, I reached for the final item, the worn-out box. The fact that it was a box, not a pouch, filled me with eager anticipation.

As I pulled the old box closer, Vivian’s eyes sparkled. There was a hint of unease in her expression, but it was overshadowed by what seemed like pride. After exchanging a brief glance with her, I opened the box. Inside was a single tattered book. This was…

*Congratulations. You have discovered a Rare Class. By reading and acquiring this book, you can change your class to Chimera Alchemist.*

A message floated in the air. But before I could even read it, another message appeared.

*The Chimera Alchemist is an advanced branch of the mage class. It allows the creation of chimeras and, when combined with summoning circles, enables the summoning of beings from other dimensions. It is recommended for users skilled in magic circles or summoning techniques.*

*Your current class, Sword Specialist, is a top-tier Secret Class in the swordsman branch. While you can acquire this book, due to your unique, special, and potential abilities, the efficiency would be reduced to 70% or less. However, your 96 Magic Power stat can recover 20% of that reduction. Acquisition is not recommended.*

“Oh…”

“This book contains the essence of my alchemy, from when I was an alchemist to after I became like this. It’s the culmination of everything I’ve learned. Mages would probably drool over it.”

“…”

“What… You don’t like it?”

As I stared into the air, Vivian spoke in a small voice. I shook my head slightly and picked up the book with trembling hands. In my first cycle, I’d searched endlessly for Rare and Secret Classes, and now one was right here. A mix of emptiness and overwhelming excitement coursed through me.

The Chimera Alchemist hadn’t appeared in my first cycle. From what I’d heard back then, the dungeon’s master had escaped, and it seemed Vivian had taken this book with her. I’d need to read it to confirm, but the fact that it was a Rare Class alone was a massive win. All the frustration and hardship I’d endured melted away, and I spoke in an excited voice.

“No, I love it. More than the gems, more than the potions—this book is the best. The essence of an alchemist’s knowledge? This will be incredibly useful.”

“R-Really? Hehe. You’re a weird guy. Hehehe, liking it that much.”

Vivian, perhaps pleased that her life’s work and achievements were being recognized, twisted her body shyly. I let out a small laugh and carefully tucked the book away. Even if I had to leave everything else behind, this book was coming with me. Not that I planned to leave anything behind, of course. Seeing my reaction, Vivian continued in a soft, lilting voice.

“So… you’re satisfied, right? You’ll let me live?”

I almost answered “Yes” immediately but stopped myself. Honestly, I didn’t feel much like killing her anymore. This was more than enough, but I had a nagging feeling there was something else I could get. After a moment of thought, I snapped my fingers with a *click*. There was one more thing I could demand.
