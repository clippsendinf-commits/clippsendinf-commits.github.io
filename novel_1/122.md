# Chapter 121: A Peaceful Daily Life

The cigarette he had discarded was still smoldering, faint wisps of gray smoke curling upward. She stared blankly at the spot where he had stood, then let out a long sigh. A sudden wave of bitter loneliness washed over her, making her tremble.  

His words echoed in her mind, each one piercing her heart like a sharp dagger. *“Rather than saying you *can’t* interfere… it’s more accurate to say you *won’t*, isn’t it, Seraph? Or perhaps you just don’t *want* to?”*  
*“And yet, for beings who call themselves angels, their actions are even more despicable than *those guys*… Tsk tsk.”*  
*“No matter which angel becomes my assistant, I have no intention of ever getting along with them.”*  

Her mind was in turmoil, so much so that she hadn’t yet retracted the hand she’d reached out to stop him as he left the Summoning Room. *“You said you had something to say… but it was just pointless nonsense. Don’t ever call me for something like this again.”*  

“Just…”  

The Summoning Room was empty, yet Seraph spoke aloud. Her gaze remained fixed on the spot where he had been, as if she hoped he might somehow hear her.  

“I just… wanted to see… if you were doing well…”  

Her voice trembled as she finished, and with a forlorn expression, she slowly withdrew her outstretched hand. Her eyes, however, lingered on the portal he had just stepped through, staring wistfully into its depths.

During my first cycle, Seraph always maintained a calm and composed demeanor. She rarely showed any signs of disarray, and the few times she did could be counted on one hand. Her raised voice or a furrowed brow were sights so rare they stood out vividly.  

Now, however, Seraph had regained her initial composure. When she saw me turn back, a trace of relief flickered across her face, and she spoke in a soft, measured tone.  

“Please, give me a moment of your time. I have something to say. It won’t take long.”  

I didn’t respond immediately. Her voice was quiet but carried a subtle note of pleading. Looking at her, I couldn’t help but recall our final parting in the first cycle.  

*“User Kim Su-hyeon, are you saying you’ll repeat those ten agonizing years all over again?”*  
*“Please… be happy…”*  

In a way, my meteoric rise in this second cycle owed something to her. True, it had cost me GP, but without the angel’s favor woven into my perks, I wouldn’t have been able to achieve this much so quickly. My starting stats in the first cycle—aside from Endurance and Agility—weren’t particularly impressive. I had confidence, sure, but I wouldn’t have grown at this breakneck pace or accomplished feats like recruiting Vivian as a companion.  

A flurry of thoughts swirled through my mind. After a moment’s deliberation, I decided it wouldn’t hurt to hear her out. I might dislike angels, but for now, we were—at least nominally—partners. With that in mind, I took a seat and spoke.  

“…Fine. What exactly do you want to talk about? And who the hell is Sandalphon?”  

My tone softened slightly, but I kept the scowl on my face. Still, Seraph’s expression brightened with relief as she began.  

“I’ll explain everything. Sandalphon is an assistant assigned to another user. Since you graduated from the User Academy, she has repeatedly requested to take over as your assistant.”  

I paused, considering her words. So, from a user’s perspective, this meant swapping out the angel assigned to them. It wasn’t unheard of—rare, but not impossible. I’d heard of a few cases in my first cycle where users’ angels had been reassigned.  

Once users entered Hall Plane, angels were tasked with guiding them—not necessarily toward what was *good* for the user, but toward the direction the angels desired. The key was that it wasn’t about what was beneficial for us, but what served *their* goals. This implied the angels had their own agenda, something they aimed to achieve through us.  

I quickly pieced it together and let out a wry chuckle.  

“Hah… Is that so? Why does she want to switch?”  

Seraph didn’t answer immediately. As I stared into her eyes, sensing I already had a rough idea, she bit her lower lip briefly before speaking.  

“Since entering Hall Plane, your actions have been nothing short of astonishing. In just over a month in Mul, you’ve explored two ruins, both successfully. Most notably, as a Year-0 user, you defeated Belphegor, an upper-tier demon—an achievement all the angels regard as a triumph. However…”  

She hesitated, her face betraying a rare uncertainty. I didn’t press her, waiting patiently for her to continue. Sensing my restraint, she resumed in a cautious tone.  

“…It seems you and I need to improve our relationship.”  

“Hm.”  

I let out a low hum. Just as I’d suspected. I pulled a cigarette from my pocket, bit the tip, and lit it. Her emerald eyes remained steady, unshaken by my actions. Smoking in front of an angel might seem ironic, but she didn’t stop me. I’d done it in the first cycle too, and she’d never commented then either.  

Taking a deep drag, I felt a slight calm settle over me. Seraph, who had been watching quietly, spoke again.  

“I won’t reiterate the role of angels. But I have one question. Why do you dislike me so much?”  

“You think I’d be fond of the ones who dragged me into Hall Plane?”  

“…That’s true, but I feel there’s more to it.”  

“What?”  

I glanced at her, surprised by her denial. She shook her head gently and continued in a calm voice.  

“It doesn’t seem like that’s the only reason. This might sound strange, but I have a feeling there’s something else—some deeper reason.”  

Her words made me pause. I tapped the floor lightly with one hand, the cigarette in the other. Now it was her turn to wait for my response. After a moment to collect myself, I sneered.  

“Is that really so important?”  

“It is. Your actions have drawn the attention of many angels, and they view you positively. Since we cannot directly interfere in Hall Plane, maintaining a good relationship with our users is crucial. They are, in a sense, our proxies. Sandalphon’s issue—and her request to replace me—stems from the strained relationship between you and me. If there’s something about me you dislike, please tell me, and I’ll do my best to address it.”  

“Rather than saying you *can’t* interfere… it’s more accurate to say you *won’t*, isn’t it, Seraph? Or perhaps you just don’t *want* to?”  

My sarcasm left her momentarily speechless, her face blank. Savoring her stunned expression and wavering gaze, I continued slowly.  

“Yeah… I don’t like you. Not just you—all angels. It all stems from that, sure, but looking at your true nature makes me want to vomit.”  

“Why… why…”  

“It’s laughable when you think about it. What, did I seem a bit promising because I’ve been playing along with your whims? Or are you afraid I might side with *those guys*?”  

“User Kim Su-hyeon, what are you saying…”  

Her face was visibly shaken, her words stumbling. I pressed on sharply.  

“Don’t play dumb. You know exactly what I mean—you’re just pretending you don’t. Stop it. It’s disgusting. Why do you think we humans were forcibly dragged into your petty power struggles? What are your true intentions for bringing Earth’s people here? What do you think would happen if the users learned the full truth?”  

Her face paled at my brazen words. I knew I’d gone a bit too far, but I had my own assurances. As long as I stayed on this side and didn’t directly harm the angels, they couldn’t touch me either.  

A tense silence followed. I took a final drag from the nearly spent cigarette and flicked it to the ground, where a thin trail of smoke rose. Pressing my advantage, I continued.  

“What good is your lofty dimensional status when your actions are so pathetic? In a way, *those guys* might be better. At least they took the risk and entered Hall Plane themselves. But the so-called angels? Their deeds are even more despicable than *those guys*. Tsk tsk.”  

“How… how do you…”  

Her lips trembled, her eyes wide with disbelief. She seemed shocked that I knew the secrets tying the angels, *those guys*, and Hall Plane together. I hadn’t known from the start, of course. It was through ten years of surviving in Hall Plane, my own research, and ultimately obtaining the Zero Code that I’d pieced together the full picture.  

Though I’d let slip something risky in the heat of the moment, I felt no regret. If anything, it was cathartic to finally vent my long-simmering frustration. Smiling faintly at her stunned expression, I continued in a gentler tone.  

“Don’t worry too much. For now, I dislike *those guys* far more than I dislike you. So I’ll play along with your tune for a while—as long as you don’t pull any nonsense, nothing unfortunate will happen.”  

“S-User Kim Su-hyeon.”  

“And one more thing.”  

I paused for effect, and she swallowed hard, her face tense. Noticing the graceful curve of her neck, I concluded calmly.  

“Tell that Sandalphon or whoever, loud and clear: I’m not interested in switching assistants. No matter which angel comes to me, I have no intention of ever getting along with them.”  

She fell silent.  

“You said you had something to say… but it was just pointless nonsense. Don’t ever call me for something like this again.”  

Having said my piece, I stood up slowly. I heard her call out, her hand reaching toward me, but I turned away without hesitation.  

With swift steps, I walked toward the portal before me.  

---

As I emerged from the portal, I saw a priest still waiting for me—the same man I’d spoken to about the expedition report. He greeted me with a warm smile, and I took a moment to compose myself inwardly.  

“You’re back quickly. Was your meeting with *them* pleasant?”  

I wanted to snap, *“Not at all. It was a load of crap.”* But knowing how fervently he revered the angels, I saw no need to stir trouble. Besides, I didn’t want to take out my frustration on an innocent bystander. So I forced a slight smile and nodded.  

“Haha. It was a good time. Thank you for delivering the oracle.”  

“Oh, it’s nothing. It’s my duty, after all.”  

He looked at me with a hint of envy, and I felt an urge to leave the temple as soon as possible. The best way to cut this short was to steer the conversation toward something less comfortable for him.  

“Right… So, regarding the expedition report, I trust you’ll handle it as quickly as possible.”  

“Ah, yes, yes. We’ll organize an investigation team as soon as we can. It might take a little time, though.”  

“I understand. But I hope you can complete the investigation and issue the certificate by mid-next month at the latest.”  

“We’ll do our best.”  

“Good. I’ll stop by the temple again later. For now, I’ll take my leave.”  

He broke into a nervous sweat at my prodding and coughed awkwardly. As expected, the topic of the expedition report overshadowed any talk of angels. With the conversation neatly concluded, he bowed politely. I nodded in return and walked down the long corridor.
