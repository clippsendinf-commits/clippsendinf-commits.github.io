# Chapter 60: Mage and Alchemist (Rare)

The tail, which had been swaying lightly as if searching for an opening, suddenly curved gracefully and shot forward. It aimed straight upward from below, clearly targeting Yujeong’s upper body—her neck, to be precise, with lethal intent. I was about to rush forward in a hurry, but Yujeong’s next move left me stunned.

“Hmph!”

With a peculiar battle cry, Yujeong crouched low, kicked off the ground, and slid forward almost touching the earth. The tail, which had been poised to pierce her neck, sliced through empty air. At the same time, Yujeong planted one hand on the ground, pivoting her body in a crescent arc. Her trajectory shifted, and in an instant, she darted behind the Renga.

The Renga, caught off guard with its rear exposed, let its tail droop with a blank expression before spinning around with a startled look. But by then, Yujeong’s dagger had already slashed mercilessly across its neck. As the Renga clutched its throat and collapsed, Yujeong sprinted toward me.

I stared at her, momentarily dazed, as she approached with a bright grin. An-hyeon, who had been about to charge forward alongside me, let out a loud exclamation, clearly as shocked as I was.

Up until now, Yujeong hadn’t fully utilized her strengths. I acknowledged the potential in her Agility and Magic stats, but her combat style was entirely different from An-hyeon’s. An-hyeon, with his focus on Strength, Endurance, and Stamina, could rely on fundamentals and still perform above average in a straightforward fight.

Yujeong, however, relied on Agility and Magic, requiring a more unconventional approach—a kind of intuitive, adaptive play. Wielding two short daggers, she was at a disadvantage in standard combat compared to chaotic skirmishes. Until now, I had ranked An-hyeon above Yujeong in pure combat ability. But after this display, I realized I might need to reconsider. Her movements were clean and efficient—simple yet devastatingly effective. That single moment left a deep impression on me. If she could consistently fight like that…

“Shiiiii!”

The enraged cries of the Rengas snapped me back to reality. As Yujeong rejoined our formation, I gave her a slight nod. Reading my expression, her flushed face broke into a continuous smile. This battle felt like it was flowing in our favor. For the first time since entering the Black Forest, I felt a sense of satisfaction.

Then it happened.

*Bang!*

Several Rengas nearby let out ferocious roars and leaped into the air—not just a simple jump, but soaring over three meters high. The group froze, momentarily stunned by the sight.

Though An-hyeon, Yujeong, and I had each taken down a Renga, Yujeong’s performance was the most striking. The Rengas, furious at the death of their kin, were now fixating on her.

I had never seen Rengas leap like that before. Knowing their intent, I realized Yujeong needed protection. A diving Leap Attack from that height would carry terrifying force, far beyond what Yujeong’s physical stats could withstand unscathed.

But our group, riding the momentum, didn’t stand idle. As if refusing to be outdone by her “unnie” and “oppa,” An-sol stepped forward, staff in hand. She had been chanting rapidly, and now, as the Rengas descended, she thrust her staff forward.

“Shackles!”

Her clear voice rang out, and the bodies of the descending Rengas stiffened, plummeting powerlessly to the ground. An-hyeon, Yujeong, and I looked at An-sol with proud expressions. Any spell could be scaled to affect multiple targets depending on the caster’s skill, and An-sol had just succeeded in binding multiple enemies for the first time. Though less potent than a single-target cast, it was enough to halt the Rengas mid-air.

An-sol, her delicate face set in a fierce glare, softened as she noticed our gazes. We had started by taking out seven Rengas in the ambush—an extraordinary result.

But over a dozen remained, their eyes glowing red with rage. Claws raised, they oozed killing intent and slowly closed in. To secure a retreat path, I edged us toward the passage we had entered from, raising my sword to a high guard.

“Kraa!”

Several Rengas roared and leaped high again, but this time I wasn’t worried. These Rengas were slightly different from what I knew, but our group was in sync, riding a powerful flow. An-hyeon and Yujeong adopted bolder stances than usual, ready to capitalize on the momentum.

As a Renga’s vicious claws met my sword, the clash signaled the battle’s resumption. Engaging them directly, I noticed subtle differences from typical Rengas: swift movements, tactical coordination to target both me and the others, and a feigned retreat to regroup for a rotating assault.

Though we started with an advantage, I couldn’t afford to be complacent. I snapped back to focus, orchestrating the battlefield. Without my timely support and An-hyeon’s inspired spearwork, the group that first fought in the Black Forest’s outskirts would have crumbled. But now, bolstered by my coordination and An-hyeon’s relentless defense, we weren’t just holding our ground—we were overpowering them.

Yujeong, too, shifted from defensive counters to aggressive dagger strikes. Though she took minor scratches, she steadily reduced the Rengas’ numbers. Her dual daggers shone in the chaos of close combat.

The tide turned decisively when An-sol’s voice echoed across the clearing again.

“Shackles!”

“Damn, that’s it! Nice, An-sol!”

Her staff pointed at the Rengas Yujeong was fighting. As their movements froze, Yujeong’s daggers found their marks with ease, and she let out a gleeful shout, slashing with even more fervor. Watching her whirl like a dervish, An-hyeon and I charged the remaining Rengas.

I fought without using any Magic, relying solely on my blade. As a Renga lunged with razor-sharp claws, I swung straight, and the sensation was like slicing tofu—clean and effortless. The Sword Specialist’s authority grew more captivating with every swing. Its passive buffs enhanced every sword-related action, and with my EX-rank Mind and Sword as One, even casual strikes carried devastating power. I couldn’t help but wonder what a full-force blow would unleash.

My sword carved through the air with a piercing shriek, and the Rengas fell like autumn leaves. An-hyeon, either sensing our dominance or thrilled by his spear moving freely, danced through the fray. Breaking through the center, he met my gaze, then spun to strike the Rengas from behind.

“Light!”

An-sol’s voice rang out again, this time casting a Light spell. A white orb materialized before the remaining Rengas’ eyes and burst into blinding brilliance. It was a tactic she’d mimicked from a mage we’d seen fighting vagrants, and it proved highly effective.

As the Rengas staggered, blinded, An-hyeon, Yujeong, and I formed a triangular formation, hammering them relentlessly. In moments, we dispatched another four or five. Only two Rengas remained, their ears drooping as if sensing their doom.

Undeterred, An-hyeon’s eyes gleamed as he called out.

“Left one’s mine.”

“Then the right’s mine.”

“…”

*

Soon after, we finished off all the Rengas in the clearing and took a moment to regroup. An-hyeon and Yujeong bore minor wounds, but after drinking potions and receiving An-sol’s healing, their faces glowed brighter than ever. The Rengas’ unusual strength crossed my mind, but I decided to hold my tongue. Rather than scolding them, letting them ride this momentum felt right.

Honestly, the group hadn’t performed exceptionally—they had simply used their inherent abilities effectively. Still, as they gained experience, they were finding their combat styles and synergy as a team. For the first time since leaving the city, I felt a surge of pride.

“I bet I took down more than you.”

“Your spear’s longer, so it’s easier to attack. If you factor that in, I did better.”

“Mental victory much?”

“It’s the truth! Should we ask Oppa?”

Lately, those two bickered at every opportunity. Their sparkling eyes turned to me, but I had little to say. Overall, An-hyeon still edged out slightly for his stability. But Yujeong had found her groove this time, making it hard to nitpick.

“Hm.”

As I put on a serious face, feigning deep thought, they grew visibly tense, clearly eager to hear my verdict. Their intense focus made it awkward to respond. I decided to deflect.

“You both did well. For now, focus on recovering—”

“But who was *better*? Even just a little?” Yujeong pressed.

Her persistence left me at a loss. To buy time, I turned to An-sol, who was innocently sucking her finger.

“Haha, what do you think, Sol?”

“Um, well… I was focused on casting, so…”

But as An-sol subtly averted her gaze, I was struck with shock. I’d hoped to pass the buck, but she’d caught on and slipped out of it. Staring at her with wounded eyes, I watched her fidget, stamping her feet nervously.

“Guess I win, then,” An-hyeon said. “Hyung’s too kind to say it outright.”

“What? Seriously?”

“When will they grow up?” I sighed deeply, watching them bicker again. They’d had their fun—time to get back to business.
