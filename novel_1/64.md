# Chapter 63: Mage and Alchemist (Rare) (2)

“This is my final warning to you all. From now on, I won’t care or say another word.”

“…”

“Just… ugh. Never mind.”

The words “I don’t care what happens” rose to the tip of my tongue, but I swallowed them back. After all, I’d grown somewhat attached to them from our time together, and it felt a bit harsh to say. Besides, I was starting to resent the subtle changes in myself, how I’d been unconsciously softening while looking after these kids. The sharp edge I once carried, the unshakable resolve, was beginning to waver. I hadn’t regressed just to play house like this. The time wasted in this dungeon felt like an unbearable loss. I wanted to rein in the laziness creeping into me.

The kids stared at me with pale, nervous faces, their breaths barely audible. Seeing their hurt expressions and glistening eyes tugged at my heart, but I quickly steeled myself. With a firm voice, I spoke up.

“The voice you just heard belongs to a Ramik. Yujeong already explained, so I’ll skip the details. But there’ll be two statues on either side. Those are traps. Don’t hesitate—destroy them before they activate.”

Instead of waiting for the traps to trigger and letting the kids gain experience, I opted for the most efficient strategy. After speaking, I strode forward quickly. The kids scrambled to follow, but I didn’t care and picked up my pace.

My brisk walk soon turned into a run. When I judged the distance had closed enough, I drew my sword. A clear *chink* of metal rang out, and a cold glint of steel scattered around me. From now on, I planned to take a more active role in clearing this place.

As I pressed forward, another passage came into view. Charging through without hesitation, I found, as expected, an open clearing with a user collapsed on the ground, their right arm severed, tears streaming down their face. My sword’s energy had struck true.

“Hel… help me… urk!”

Before the kids could react, I lunged forward and sliced through the Ramik’s neck. On either side of the decapitated Ramik stood two statues, not gargoyles or other monsters, but human-shaped figures clad in plated armor.

Killing the Ramik didn’t deactivate the traps, so I immediately targeted one of the statues, thrusting my sword. A grinding *grrrk* sounded as the statue began to raise its arm, its eyes flashing with light as my blade struck. But that was all. My sword pierced cleanly through its core, shattering the nucleus. I twisted the blade and pulled it out; the statue stopped moving.

“Ha!”

An-hyeon wasn’t idle either. He exuded a chilling aura, showing he’d mentally braced himself again. Following my lead, he drove his spear deep into the remaining statue. Infused with mana, the spear effortlessly shattered the stone armor. A cracking sound echoed, and as he withdrew his spear, a large hole gaped in the statue’s center. I turned immediately.

“Next. We’re moving.”

Since we hadn’t lost much stamina, I decided to head straight to the next clearing. An-hyeon followed closely, but Yujeong and Sol wore dazed expressions. They glanced between the liquified Ramik and the broken statues before hurrying after us as we moved farther away.

“Next up… a goblin pack. Easy enough. Form up. We’ll hit them like we did the Rengas.”

The next clearing was, as expected, a goblin den. But it wasn’t something to underestimate—there was a goblin shaman and its escort of hobgoblins. A group like that would’ve been a challenge for new users, but unfortunately for them, it wasn’t enough to trouble me.

After entering the clearing, I quickly broke formation, cutting down the goblin shaman and the hobgoblins guarding it. Then, I lured the remaining goblins back into our formation and charged. There were quite a few, but our experience with tougher monsters like the Black Scorpions and Black Wolves helped immensely. Without their leader, wiping out the goblin pack was as easy as eating rice cake lying down.

After the battle, I detoxified An-hyeon, who’d been hit by a poisoned dart from the goblins, and we took a break. While An-sol healed An-hyeon, Yujeong and I scoured the clearing for items. Goblins love shiny things, so there was a good chance we’d find something worthwhile. Their weapons and armor were useless, but our search paid off.

The group’s mood was noticeably heavy. To lift their spirits, I showed them what we’d found. There wasn’t much gold—only about 30 Gold—but we scored three gemstones: two small opals I’d tucked away and a red sapphire pried from the goblin shaman’s staff.

Tossing and catching one of the opals, I spoke up.

“Look at this. The opal’s small, but it’s got a nice luster. One like this could fetch at least 20 Gold. Two of them make 40 Gold. And this thick red sapphire? Probably 70 Gold. Add the 30 Gold, and that’s 140 Gold total. The four of us combined didn’t even scrape together 10 Gold in three months at the User Academy. This one fight earned us fourteen times that.”

“So, the deeper we go…”

“Exactly. There could be even greater treasures. See why users are so obsessed with dungeon diving now?”

Yujeong’s eyes sparkled at the sight of the gems. An-hyeon nodded frantically, stunned by the haul. A hint of relief flickered across their faces, likely because my tone had softened slightly. Seeing their reactions, I chuckled inwardly. They really trusted and followed me. But I couldn’t afford to go too easy on them, or the mood would unravel, so I maintained a stern demeanor.

After dealing with the Rengas, Ramik, and goblin den, we pressed forward without pause. Once An-hyeon’s treatment was done, we set out immediately. The kids didn’t complain—having just seen the rewards, they were probably eager to see what came next.

After passing through another passage, we reached a clearing that was a spider nest. These weren’t ordinary spiders—their black, bristly shells gleamed with an inky sheen. Yellow venom dripped from their bodies, suggesting they were poisonous.

They’d be tricky to deal with, but I had a gut feeling that clearing this area would lead us to our destination. It was the kind of instinct honed from countless dungeons. The alchemist’s stronghold was close. Eager to move on, I stepped into the clearing.

*Thud! Roll…*

“Eek!”

A green orb suddenly dropped from the ceiling, striking Sol’s head and rolling across the floor. Sol let out a cute scream and panicked. I quickly kicked the orb away and looked up.

“Ugh…”

“What… what is that…?”

The kids, following my gaze, let out groans and froze in shock. They pointed upward, mouths agape, unable to speak.

Hanging from the ceiling was a user, suspended by white threads binding their arms, dangling limply like a spider’s web. It was a female user, her clothes torn to rags. The problem was her abnormally swollen abdomen.

Seeing her state, I frowned. There was nothing I could do right now except look. I’d only been scanning the ground with my detection, so I hadn’t noticed something suspended in the air. If I’d used my full perception, I might’ve caught it.

Blaming myself for my carelessness, I activated my Third Eye. Though her body was heavily altered, she was still human, so I could pull up her user information. I also hoped to glean some useful details.

* Due to external interference, the user’s body has undergone mutation, causing significant losses to Endurance and Stamina. The loss is ongoing.
* The primary mutated area is the perineum. The user is currently in a state of forced impregnation.
* The spiders growing inside her body are feeding on her mana and will hatch upon maturity.

“Ugh… ahh… ah…”

Ji-yeon’s groans echoed as her face contorted. Her perineum parted slightly, and more glistening green orbs—spider eggs—fell to the ground. The eggs wriggled, and sharp legs tore through, emerging from the clumps. The kids, watching this unfold, initially stayed silent but soon radiated fury, likely influenced by their alignments.

The sight of Ji-yeon’s swollen belly and the spider eggs dropping from her was clear enough. The kids, especially Yujeong and Sol, being female users themselves, burned with rage far fiercer than usual.

I felt sympathy too, but not because she was a young, beautiful 20-year-old in her prime meeting such a fate. Her stats, even in her second year, weren’t bad at all. With her potential, she could’ve been a valuable mage for our party. Adding up her lost stats, she had decent growth potential, someone we might’ve recruited in the city.

But that was all in the past. To me now, she was just a vessel producing spider monsters. I briefly thought of the Elixir but shook my head. Using it here would be a waste. In that case, killing her might be kinder.

Sure, there might be a way to save her if I searched hard enough, but honestly, it felt like too much trouble. She was pretty enough, but something about her seemed a bit off-putting. I wasn’t convinced she’d make a good ally, so I had no desire to waste a precious Elixir or go through the effort of restoring her. All I wanted was to finish this dungeon and return to the city. That was my true feeling.
