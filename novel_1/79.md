# Memorize - Chapter 78: A Bumper Crop of Mages

I didn’t feel elated about successfully exploring the dungeon. Instead, I tried my best to return to our usual routine as quickly as possible, as if nothing had happened. In response to my efforts, I hoped the kids would focus on refining their skills rather than basking in the excitement.

Normally, news of a successful expedition would spread throughout the city, attracting curious Users and causing a stir. I was a bit concerned about that myself, but ironically, the temple’s decision to temporarily withhold expedition reports turned it into a secret known only to us.

For now, this was a good thing. It meant we wouldn’t waste time dealing with unnecessary attention. Of course, I had no intention of burying the achievement forever. Discovering the dungeon of the ancient alchemist Vivian was a significant accomplishment, one that would earn high recognition when we eventually founded our clan. It would be a shame to let it go to waste.

The kids’ daily routine was a repetitive cycle. They woke up in the morning for detection training, followed by personalized instruction from me. In the afternoon, we’d head outside the city to practice formations and combat techniques against monsters. Before evening, we returned to the inn for individual maintenance time to wrap up the day.

After dinner, the kids used their maintenance time to rest or train further, but for me, that was when the real hustle began. There was an endless list of tasks: sorting and selling the day’s loot, scouring records to locate the Ruined Laboratory, and occasionally meeting with the kids who requested one-on-one discussions. I also had to figure out which formations were most effective and what roles suited each of them—everything fell on my shoulders.

Of course, since the kids were involved, I often called on them, and not one of them ever showed annoyance. They knew how busy I was. While they could secure rest or sleep whenever they wanted, I couldn’t afford that luxury.

After finishing all my tasks, I didn’t go straight to bed. Instead, I used the early morning hours for my personal training. It wasn’t about improving my skills but maintaining them—swordsmanship, meditation, and physical conditioning. Once that was done, I’d catch an hour or two of sleep before starting the day again. Sometimes, I couldn’t even manage that much rest. The kids were amazed and worried about my schedule, but I brushed it off, saying, “It’s better for you all to grow up quickly and help me out.” Honestly, it wasn’t that tough. Compared to the days in the Fairy Forest or Hell, where I pushed myself to the limit, this life felt like paradise.

The kids’ training intensity had increased. It was much tougher than when we first arrived in Mul, yet I never heard a single complaint. In fact, they were so eager that An-hyeon tried to follow me for early morning training. I barely managed to convince him to rest, explaining that for growing kids, sleep and rest were as crucial as training itself. My body was already at its peak, so I wasn’t affected, but they needed balance.

Still, their attitudes had undeniably changed. The recent trip to the Black Forest was both an adventure and a gamble. Sure, having me—Kim Su-hyeon, the ace in the hole—helped, but the dangerous situations they faced must have left an impression. Before, they followed me somewhat reluctantly, but now their eyes burned with determination to learn more. Seeing that made me deeply satisfied.

While I was better suited to train An-hyeon and Yu-jeong, Vivian was the ideal mentor for An-sol. An-sol seemed a bit reluctant, but since they were both mana-based Users, she accepted my decision. I also hoped their training together would help them bond, even just a little.

I kept the items we obtained from the dungeon in storage. For now, I decided to store the gems, potion pouches, and books in a general warehouse. I was tempted to sell the gems, but acquiring such high-quality ones in bulk wasn’t easy, so I chose to hold onto them in case we needed them later. Everything else—items from vagrants, gems from goblins, and so on—was sold, netting us nearly 150 Gold. Additionally, the byproducts from the monsters we hunted brought in anywhere from 50 Silver to 1 Gold daily. We no longer had to worry about inn fees, a clear sign we’d moved beyond rookie status.

But with money coming in, there were also expenses to consider.

The top priority was upgrading the kids’ equipment. Their weapons were fine for now, but improvements were necessary. I had just under 700 Gold left, and I decided to invest at least 100 Gold per person: An-hyeon, An-sol, Yu-jeong, and Vivian.

Vivian’s skills were already proven, so she didn’t need much. She chose a mage robe (27 Gold) to keep her warm and enhance mana activity, along with a staff (63 Gold) to boost mana circulation.

An-sol didn’t need much either. Just in case, I got her a thin scale armor (38 Gold) to wear underneath and a priest robe (46 Gold) to enhance her divine spells. I tried to replace her staff, but she clung to it, refusing to let go.

“Nooo… I don’t want to! I like this one! It’s fine!” she whined.

“Why? I’ll get you a better one. That one’s decent, but…”

“Nooo! This is the first one oppa bought me!” she cried, tears welling up.

I gave in. After some coaxing, we settled on upgrading her staff by embedding a gem (61 Gold) that significantly boosted mana activity. Perhaps it was her feminine side, but once I dangled the shiny gem in front of her, she hesitantly handed over the staff.

An-hyeon and Yu-jeong, being melee fighters, required more attention to their armor, which naturally meant higher costs. An-hyeon, as both a damage dealer and tank, needed sturdy gear. I wanted to outfit him in full heavy armor, but a decent set would cost at least 900 Gold. Instead, we opted to build his gear piece by piece. He got a lightweight enchanted chain mail (124 Gold), a chest plate (48 Gold), and leg guards (39 Gold). The cost was higher than expected, so I redirected some of my own equipment budget to him. In the process, he jokingly called me “Dad” and earned a playful smack, which became a lighthearted moment.

Yu-jeong, as a dealer specializing in chaotic skirmishes, needed gear that wouldn’t restrict her movement. We got her a lightweight ring mail (92 Gold) to wear underneath and a monster leather armor (71 Gold). The leather armor was pricier because it was treated with a potion to maintain its defensive strength while staying soft, adding over 20 Gold to the cost.

Yu-jeong protested that it was too expensive and waved it off, but when I insisted on the potion treatment, her cheeks flushed. She might’ve acted reluctant, but deep down, she seemed pleased.

In total, we spent about 520 Gold. Over 500 Gold vanished in an instant, leaving just over 100 Gold. But I didn’t regret it. Seeing the kids’ satisfied expressions made it worthwhile, and I felt a sense of fulfillment.

With their new gear, they finally shed their rookie appearances. They might not look like veterans, but they were starting to resemble proper Users with decent equipment and armor. As I watched them with a warm smile, Yu-jeong sidled up and teased, “Oppa, aren’t you going to cry?”

“Why would I cry?” I asked.

“You know, like parents do when their kids wear their school uniforms for the first time. ‘Oh, our babies have grown so much!’ Sniff, sniff. So touching.”

“Keep talking nonsense,” I said, flicking her forehead.

“Ow! That hurts!” she pouted, rubbing her forehead. I sighed, but honestly, I did feel a bit emotional. It felt like just yesterday they were fumbling through the Rite of Passage, yet here they were, acting together as a cohesive group—something even I hadn’t expected.

When we first arrived in Mul, they wore the standard clothes from the User Academy, looking like complete novices. Now, they were starting to look like legitimate Users. Yu-jeong, thrilled with her new gear, was playfully swinging her dagger in front of me. I watched her with a maternal smile, wondering if this was what it felt like to raise kids.

Some nearby Users glanced at our lively group with envious eyes. Judging by their gear, they weren’t much different from us, but they lacked proper armor or even decent weapons. Their tattered clothes suggested they were still wearing what the User Academy provided. For them, proper equipment was a distant dream—they were likely struggling just to get by day to day. That was the reality for Users who hadn’t joined a clan. I didn’t blame them; buying this much gear in less than a month without a clan was near miraculous.

For now, I decided we’d upgrade their armor again before leaving Mul, tying up the equipment issue. It felt like a major burden had been lifted.

Though the gear wasn’t top-tier by my standards, it was decent enough, and the kids’ training and hunting efficiency improved dramatically. Beyond the physical upgrades, they seemed mentally motivated as well. That motivation sometimes went overboard, with them itching to go on another expedition. I firmly rejected their requests. Even seasoned Users avoided rushing into another expedition right after re-equipping. We needed to reflect on our previous expedition, address shortcomings, and incorporate necessary improvements.

In terms of personnel, equipment, experience, and skill, our group was still lacking. Especially in experience and skill, jumping straight into another expedition was out of the question. Like reviewing a game of Go, we had to face our weaknesses and fix them. The more each member improved, the stronger the group became as a whole. I made it clear: no more expeditions until we addressed the issues from the last one.

And so, we continued our routine, like squirrels on a wheel, repeating the same cycle day after day. The kids, as if to show they were in their prime growth phase, were improving at an astonishing rate.
