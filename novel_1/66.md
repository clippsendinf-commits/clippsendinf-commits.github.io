# Memorize - Chapter 65 (65/1068)

# Notice of Hiatus

First, I ask for your understanding as this is a notice rather than a regular chapter update.

Today, I received news of the passing of a close relative, as mentioned previously.  
They briefly regained consciousness after my father arrived, but they were unable to wake again.  
The doctor had said their condition seemed to be improving, so this feels all the more unpredictable.  
My father remarked that people are leaving one by one, and those fleeting words keep piercing my heart deeply.  

My mind is in turmoil. I will likely need to head down immediately or early tomorrow morning.  
As a result, I will be taking a hiatus from February 2 (Saturday) to February 3 (Sunday).  
I sincerely ask for the readers’ understanding. I’m truly sorry.  

Sincerely,  
Ro Yu-jin
