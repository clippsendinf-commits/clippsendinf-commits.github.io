# Chapter 119: A Peaceful Daily Life

I hurriedly rushed to her side to comfort her, but she ended up bursting into tears anyway. As a result, I had no choice but to spend meaningless time trying to soothe her. Of course, it was my fault, but Vivian clung to me, venting her grievances for over an hour.

“What did I do wrong… Why do you keep picking on me… *sob*…”

“I really tried so hard… I made up my mind to do my best… Did I ever ask to be babied like a child?! I’d be happy if you just treated me kindly, so why do you keep being so mean… *sob*…”

I was sweating bullets trying to calm her down. In the middle of it, Shin Sang-yong walked in, saw Vivian crying her heart out in my arms and me awkwardly comforting her, and a small incident ensued. (For the record, Shin Sang-yong politely bowed and quietly closed the door again.)

“Kim Su-hyeon. Do you hate me? You don’t, right? Right?”

“Of course not. You know how much I rely on you, Vivian.”

“*Sniff*… *sob*…”

I said those words to the sobbing Vivian, but honestly, they weren’t my true feelings. *Yeah, every time I see you, I just want to tease you and make you cry. So brace yourself, because I’ll probably do this a lot. Cry plenty for me, okay?*

“…”

But I couldn’t exactly say that out loud. So, after barely wiping away her tears, I let out a sigh and left the Modest Lady inn. Another sigh escaped me. How did Kim Su-hyeon end up like this? Was I being influenced by the kids I was hanging out with? Even though I told myself it wasn’t true, I couldn’t deny that I was becoming more and more of a pervert as time went on.

Anyway, I pushed those thoughts aside for the moment and quickened my pace, crossing the plaza through the streets of Mul. Today’s destination was a jewelry shop. I entered a street lined with stores. For now, the only shop I planned to visit this morning was the jeweler’s. The tasks I needed to handle in Mul from now on would require a significant amount of money. Naturally, I needed to secure some funds as well.

Of course, I had plenty of time. But even with time to spare, dawdling wasn’t in my nature. I believed it was better to get things done quickly so I could relax later. The problem was that after finishing one task, I’d just find another one to tackle.

Pioneer cities typically guaranteed a certain number of users as residents. It was rare for a pioneer city to be this quiet. The current situation was proof of how much attention the Golden Lion Clan’s Steel Mountains expedition plan was receiving. Barbara was probably so packed right now that there wasn’t a single vacant room in the inns, and the streets would be bustling with no room to step.

If the expedition succeeded, it’d be a jackpot. Securing just one safe passage connecting the southern cities to Atlanta would bring unimaginable profits. But having personally participated in the Steel Mountains expedition, I had no lingering regrets about joining. I could guarantee that within two days of entering the Steel Mountains, the expedition would lose over a quarter of its forces. And if they pushed forward despite those losses, they’d be utterly crushed in less than five days, with only a handful of users returning in tatters. I’d seen it with my own eyes.

Clans that accurately judged the situation and planned for the future would start to rise from that point onward. They’d likely been quietly building their strength all this time. By the time they returned from the Screaming Cave, many things would have changed. That’s why I deliberately left the easiest cave for last.

While lost in these thoughts, I occasionally spotted a few users looking to hire caravans. Passing them by, I soon entered the densely packed shopping district. I slowly scanned the complicated array of shops on either side of me. A first-time user would definitely get lost here. Since it was a pioneer city, things weren’t fully organized yet. Even I felt a bit disoriented, but I soon recalled my destination and found the jewelry shop I was aiming for.

“I wonder if the old man’s doing well.”

Before entering, I thought about lighting a cigarette but shook my hand clean instead. The old man I knew disliked the smell of tobacco. Smacking my lips, I looked up at the sign above the shop. In plain black letters, it read:

*Old Man’s Jewelry Shop*. No matter how many times I saw it, I couldn’t help but think it was a terrible naming sense. I opened the door and stepped inside. Inside the shop, I saw a single user intently examining a gem. White hair and a wrinkled face—he looked like someone who’d be called “Tiger Grandpa” back on Earth.

Curiosity piqued, I activated my Third Eye.

A Rare Class with somewhat ambiguous stats. But looking at his True Name, I could understand his intentions. Given his age, he clearly had little ambition left. Despite having considerable skill, he was content to live out his days quietly in a small city like this. Still, with his level of ability, he could’ve found a place in a bigger organization if he wanted.

His unique ability, *Value Seeker*, wasn’t combat-oriented but synergized well with his profession. From what I remembered, he wasn’t a bad person. Despite the sound of the door opening, Lee Man-seong kept examining the gem. Only when I stood quietly did he finally open his wrinkled mouth.

“…Here as a customer?”

“Yes.”

“If you’re here, say something. Why’re you just standing there?”

“You seemed focused, so I didn’t want to interrupt.”

“Hm.”

He gently placed the gem down and turned to face me. Staring at me for a moment, Lee Man-seong gestured for me to come closer and sit.

“Hmm. It’s been a while since I’ve seen… Anyway, come sit.”

“Thank you.”

I had power, sure, but I had no intention of abusing it. The world of Hall Plane still saw me as a Year 0 user, and I needed to act accordingly. Besides, maintaining a good relationship with this old man wouldn’t hurt.

“So, you here to buy gems or sell them?”

This old man disliked long-winded talk. In that case…

“I’m here to sell. One type of gem—rubies, eight in total.”

“Good. Let’s see them.”

Among other users, Lee Man-seong had a poor reputation. His prickly personality played a part, but his uncompromising gem appraisals and refusal to haggle didn’t help. Users trying to get a higher price always left with harsh words or flat rejections. Occasionally, hot-headed users would try to confront him, but Lee Man-seong’s mage stats were far from weak.

Still, I got along with him pretty well. He hated wasting time with unnecessary chatter and always appraised gems quickly and accurately. Users who shared my mindset often frequented this shop. While he wasn’t exactly warm, he wasn’t cold either—he’d sometimes give a slightly better price to regulars or those he liked.

I quickly reached into my pocket, pulled out the pouch containing the gems, and placed it in front of him. When he turned the pouch upside down, eight rubies spilled out with a soft clatter, their red gleam catching the light. These were the gems I’d found on the first floor of the Ruined Laboratory.

With practiced ease, he picked up a ruby and examined it, turning it over and tapping it lightly. I could see the faint glow of magical calculation in his eyes—likely his *Value Seeker* ability at work. He went through the same process with each ruby.

The appraisal didn’t take long. In just five minutes, he’d evaluated all eight. Lining them up in a row, he pointed to each one and spoke.

“From the left: 108 Gold, 112 Gold, 102 Gold, 117 Gold, 136 Gold, 122 Gold, 147 Gold, 101 Gold. Total: 945 Gold. No haggling—this is the exact price. If you don’t like it, you can leave…”

“Sounds good.”

“…Hm?”

My immediate agreement made him look up at me with a glint of surprise in his eyes. This was where users often misunderstood him. At a glance, it might seem like he was carelessly skimming the gems and throwing out prices, but I’d already estimated these rubies to be worth around 100 Gold each. After checking his user information, I knew his appraisal skills were unmatched when it came to gems.

He stared at my face for a moment before speaking in a husky voice.

“…Not gonna haggle?”

“I was referred by someone who said you’re an expert at appraisals. I trust the pride of a craftsman.”

“There aren’t many who’d treat me so kindly. You’re a strange one—both you and whoever told you that.”

“Haha.”

Despite his gruff words, a faint smile tugged at his lips. He let out a few fake coughs as I chuckled.

“Ahem! I don’t know where you got these… but I rarely give over 100 Gold for gems like these. They’re good quality, though—large, clear, and with high magical purity despite their age. They’re the kind of gems mages would love.”

“I don’t know much about gems, but I think the price is fair.”

When I agreed without adding any opinions, he gave me a look like I was some rare creature. For me, picking up gems during dungeon explorations was as easy as picking up pebbles on the road, but for novice users, getting gems from monsters was a stroke of luck. Especially for those struggling early on, they’d try to haggle for a higher price.

But I wasn’t much different in that regard. In my first cycle, I’d come here, hand over gems, take the money, and leave. If the pouch felt heavier than expected, I’d just assume he’d given me a bit extra that day. We rarely spoke much, so for Lee Man-seong to initiate conversation with a first-time user like me was rare indeed.

In response to my polite reply, he rummaged through a drawer with steady hands and tossed a pouch in front of me.

“A 1000 Gold pouch. I added about 6–7 Gold per gem.”

“Oh, you didn’t have to…”

When I waved my hands with a surprised expression, he pushed the pouch toward me with an indifferent look. Did this old man eat something weird today?

“It’s a one-time thing. Gems of this quality aren’t easy to come by, and business has been slow lately with everyone caught up in that expedition nonsense… Tsk tsk. Just take it.”

“Thank you.”

Refusing further would’ve been rude, so I picked up the pouch with a pleasant smile. I’d expected around 800 Gold, but I’d just made an extra 200 Gold in a flash. Considering the massive costs of founding a clan, this was genuinely good news. I’d planned to use GP to get more money soon anyway, but free money was free money.

Watching me take the pouch, Lee Man-seong spoke again.

“…Come back often. Don’t go to the shop across the street. I’m better than them.”

“Of course.”

“Hmph. If you’re done, get going.”

With my cheerful reply, he snorted and turned back to his gems. Was he embarrassed just now? I chuckled at this unexpected side of him and left the jewelry shop, the heavy pouch in my hand giving me a sense of reassurance.

Now, it was time to head to the temple. I needed to report my expedition and get it certified to count as an achievement. And… by now, I was pretty sure Seraph’s summons would’ve come through at least once.
