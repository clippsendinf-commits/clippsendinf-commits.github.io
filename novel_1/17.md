# Memorize - Chapter 16: Split in Half

As I mentioned before, Deadmen in the Hall Plane aren’t even considered proper monsters. Their abilities are limited to a bit of intelligence and the power to infect. Given that the Hall Plane is meant to test one’s qualifications, a sturdy adult male wielding an iron pipe could take down a Deadman with over an eighty percent success rate—assuming it’s one-on-one and the person is in a clear state of mind.

An-hyeon, equipped with a longsword and shield, had decent base stats. With a resolute mindset and some skill in handling weapons, he could grow far beyond his current level. Deadmen were that trivial to deal with.

Once he found his rhythm, his movements became more assertive, and his slashes grew unrestrained. An-hyeon was clever and a natural-born fighter. Though he still couldn’t shake off a hint of unease, he prioritized defense, countering to take down Deadmen. With a bit more confidence, he could likely handle three or four of them at once with just his longsword.

After choosing to charge straight through, we began to swiftly exit the forest. While tracing the escape route, Kim Han-byeol spotted traces of a path, giving us hope that following it would lead us out. Naturally, our pace quickened. However, the deeper we descended, the more frequently Deadmen appeared—an unavoidable reality. Deciding to use this as a chance to build An-hyeon’s combat experience, he took on most of the fighting.

Four Deadmen, catching the scent of humans, let out grating cries as they charged with gaping maws. An-hyeon’s eyes gleamed with confidence, his aggressive tendencies becoming more apparent. As he raised his sword and shield, An-sol spoke in a voice as faint as a mosquito’s buzz.

“Oppa… be careful…”

“Yeah. Just wait a bit. Hyung, please protect Sol and the others.”

“Don’t worry about them. I’ve got their backs.”

“Who’re you calling kids?” Lee Yu-jeong protested, prompting a brief chuckle from An-hyeon before he charged forward with fierce, unbridled energy.

He’d handled two at a time before, but four was a first. I loaded an arrow into my crossbow, preparing for any unexpected trouble.

Facing the onrushing monsters, An-hyeon stepped diagonally to the left with about a meter to spare. Human bodies are flexible, but Deadmen’s aren’t. The creatures, charging with intent to bite, faltered due to their stiff joints. Seizing the moment of weakness in their lateral response, An-hyeon thrust his sword into one’s head. One down. He swiftly pulled the blade free, keeping the remaining three at bay.

Watching him, I couldn’t help but think he was the real deal. What impressed me most was his ability to exploit an opponent’s weakness rather than sticking to rote attack-and-defend patterns. Knowing Deadmen struggle with pivoting, his diagonal dodge was praiseworthy.

A crunching sound rang out as one monster staggered back a few steps. Deadmen’s only attack is biting. Raising a shield above chest level is far more effective and safer for striking. An-hyeon, without anyone teaching him, was figuring this out on his own. As a Deadman’s teeth rattled, his sword darted in like a meteor. With a squelch, I mentally noted: two down.

With two gone, only half remained. Perhaps because he’d dispatched the first two so easily, the shield in his left hand seemed to loosen compared to before. One Deadman lunged, desperate for a bite, and An-hyeon watched it calmly, reversing his grip on the sword. My eyes lit up. Was he about to attempt a one-handed sword-drawing technique?

Calculating the distance and timing his swing, An-hyeon was no stranger to swordplay—I knew the principle well myself. As the gaping Deadman entered range, I saw his grip tighten. Now was the moment.

*Skrrt!*

A chilling sound of flesh being sliced echoed through the air. Though rough, he’d pulled off a deft arc, cleaving the Deadman’s head clean through the center. A flicker of exhilaration crossed his face. But my brow furrowed for the first time. One monster remained.

As the third Deadman collapsed, the last one charged from behind, pouncing on An-hyeon. He raised his shield quickly, but its loose grip couldn’t withstand the force. I aimed my loaded crossbow, watching their collision.

*Thud!*

“Ugh!”

As expected, An-hyeon lost his grip on the shield. Unlike before, when he’d absorbed impacts with his whole body, relying only on his left arm was a mistake. His hand was likely numb by now. The collision left his front defenseless, and the Deadman’s teeth shot toward his chest like a snake. I fired my arrow instantly. Sorry, but he’s too valuable to become your meal.

With a sharp whistle, the arrow pierced the Deadman’s head. As it crumpled, just inches from biting An-hyeon’s neck, he collapsed to the ground, looking like he’d aged ten years.

“Phew…”

“Boss, nice shot.”

Unaware of how close that was, Lee Yu-jeong tossed me a playful remark. An-hyeon fought well in the moment but still lacked foresight. Then again, expecting that much from him now might be greedy. Stroking his neck with a dazed expression, he looked at me with relief in his voice.

“Thanks to you, I’m alive. Thanks, Hyung.”

“No big deal. Just helped with one. Good work.”

He shook his head at my casual response, muttering in disbelief.

“I didn’t expect that attack to come like that. If not for your arrow…”

Glancing at An-sol, I saw her lips trembling, on the verge of tears. Shuddering as if she couldn’t bear to hear more, An-hyeon fell silent.

“No helping it. The timing was perfect. I’ll cover you as much as I can in cases like that…”

“Waaah!”

Before I could finish, An-sol, unable to hold back, burst into tears and ran to her brother. Their sibling bond was touching. Feeling a bit awkward, I unloaded the crossbow and tucked the arrow back into my quiver. Lee Yu-jeong, ever the firebrand, looked at them with a hint of envy in her voice.

“Watching this, I feel like I could do it too… Tsk. Should’ve picked a weapon. Han-byeol, you got anything?”

Kim Han-byeol rummaged in her belongings and pulled out a short dagger. It might work for throwing, but for melee, it was inefficient—requiring near point-blank range to land a hit. In the hands of a master like me, it’d be different, but for an average person, swinging it at a Deadman’s head risked getting bitten.

“Doesn’t seem like it’d help much. Why do you carry that?”

“Just in case. Better to end it myself than suffer a worse fate.”

“…What are you, some Joseon-era martyr?”

At Kim Han-byeol’s flat tone, Lee Yu-jeong shook her head in exasperation, then eyed the crossbow on my left arm. Realizing she didn’t know how to use it, she grumbled in disappointment.

“Where’s that iron pipe that guy was holding? Han-byeol, check if there’s anything around.”

“Nothing.”

Kim Han-byeol’s expression soured, likely annoyed at Lee Yu-jeong’s overly familiar tone. My mind drifted to Park Dong-geol’s group. Compared to my own Rite of Passage, we were having an easy time. Back then, the first two days were pure running. What were they doing now? Still fleeing? Or perhaps already torn apart in the bellies of Deadmen?

Not my concern, so I pushed the thought aside. Whether from the battle or soothing An-sol, An-hyeon approached us with slightly weary steps.

“Hyung, the path’s getting clearer. I think we’re almost out. Should we keep moving?”

“Yeah, let’s go.”

Overhearing us, Lee Yu-jeong, still sore about not having a weapon, snapped irritably.

“Tch, having a blast, huh? Keep that up, and you might get taken out. Be careful.”

“I’d rather go down fighting than get eaten quietly. Let’s hurry.”

“I know. I’m sick of this forest too. Wanna get out ASAP.”

After dealing with the four Deadmen, we moved quickly down the path. It was clear this route would lead us out. But the growing number of Deadmen lurking at the forest’s edge was concerning. My senses picked up over twenty. Changing direction wouldn’t likely make a difference.

Fighting four was one thing; twenty was another. If a frontal assault wasn’t an option, there was only one way to clear the escape route. Sighing inwardly, I began to think of how to persuade the group.

*

As expected, the forest’s edge was crawling with Deadmen. A quick glance showed over twenty, their growls filling every direction. That count was just what was visible ahead; causing a commotion would draw more from the sides.

In the distance, I spotted a stone wall marked by human presence. Beyond it, a rough but passable road came into view. One more step, and we’d be out of the forest. The group, aware of this, seemed tense with anticipation. No matter how skilled An-hyeon was, he couldn’t take on over twenty Deadmen. Yet retreating felt like a bitter pill to swallow.

“Crazy… How are we supposed to get through *that*?”

Lee Yu-jeong’s defeated voice echoed everyone’s thoughts. Turning back offered no guarantee of a better situation. An-hyeon and Kim Han-byeol, staring at the ground, seemed out of ideas. Was that the only option left? With a light sigh, I decided to step up.

“I’ve got an idea.”

Their ears seemed to perk up at my words. I got straight to the point.
