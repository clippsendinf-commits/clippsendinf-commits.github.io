# Chapter 116: Interesting

The spinning saucer fell to the floor and shattered into pieces. However, Go Yeon-ju showed no intention of cleaning it up. Her face, usually languid and relaxed, had turned cold, her sharp gaze fixed on me.

I met her piercing stare calmly, taking a drag from my cigarette. With a hint of kindness, I spoke again.

“…It doesn’t matter since we’re in Mul anyway.”

“User Kim Su-hyeon.”

“Yes.”

Go Yeon-ju spat the cigarette from her mouth onto the floor and stared at me intently. After a moment, I saw the corner of her lips curl slightly upward.

“You… are truly interesting.”

“I’m also curious why the Shadow Queen is in a small city like this.”

“You’re unmistakably a Year 0 user… but your speech, actions, and presence feel like someone who’s been through the wringer. You’re so intriguing I might lose sleep over it.”

She giggled, finishing her words, and sidled up to me, gently pressing her hip against my thigh. With a decadent smile, she leaned her body close to my chest.

As she rested her head against me, I whispered softly in her ear.

“What’s so interesting about me?”

In response, Go Yeon-ju’s hand slowly traced over my body. I mirrored her, brushing my fingers along her ear and neck. To an outsider, we might have looked like lovers whispering sweet nothings, but the reality was far different. The hands touching each other could, in an instant, turn into deadly weapons if either of us misstepped.

I saw her throat bob as my hand, laced with killing intent, grazed her skin.

“From the moment I saw you. A Year 0 user using *Pahae* (Break Harm)? Does that even make sense?”

“And?”

“The kids you’re traveling with aren’t ordinary either. When you first arrived, they were like chicks, but how could they grow so much in such a short time? It’s like they’ve been trained by a seasoned veteran…”

“Ha. You’ve got a sharp eye. But they’re still lacking.”

“Don’t joke.”

At my modesty, Go Yeon-ju snapped sharply and turned her body. She raised both hands, resting them on my shoulders, facing me fully. Her posture was even more provocative, more seductive. Wondering if she was using *Lure Eyes* again, I immediately activated my *Third Eye*.

“Ho ho. Don’t be so guarded. I don’t use the same trick twice on someone it didn’t work on.”

“How about giving me some space? It’s a bit… overwhelming.”

“Oh? Do you know how many users would kill to touch my chest or hips?”

“A flower laced with poison isn’t something I want to touch. One wrong move, and I’ll get stung.”

At my cold words, a fleeting look of loneliness crossed her face. It was only for a moment, but I saw it clearly. Did I say something wrong?

Without a word, Go Yeon-ju kneaded my shoulders with her hands. Surprisingly, her massage was quite refreshing.

“You…”

Silence hung between us for a while until she was about to speak again.

At that moment, both of us turned toward the staircase. The sound of a door opening and someone descending from the third floor reached us. With a reluctant expression, Go Yeon-ju moistened her lips and slowly stood up.

“Six portions of Course A, right, sir?”

Her tone had shifted back to normal. I smirked and nodded.

“Yes. Please serve it warm.”

“I will. But make some time for me later, okay?”

“Hm.”

“Come on, don’t be so coy.”

Go Yeon-ju winked, then turned and walked away with her usual seductive sway. Watching her retreating figure, I let the mana I had gathered within me subside.

Go Yeon-ju was a user I could never let my guard down around.

---

The first to come down was An-hyeon. He peeked around as he descended, checking for Go Yeon-ju. When he saw she wasn’t there, a disappointed look crossed his face before he sat at my table.

“Hello. I’m An-hyeon, a Rare Class Ki-Gong Spearmaster.”

“…You’ll let people know soon enough, but don’t go blabbing about it everywhere.”

“Heh, sorry, hyung. I’m just so thrilled.”

Despite my reprimand, An-hyeon grinned brightly. I fixed him with a cold stare. He was starting to see the Hall Plane differently. At first, he might have felt nothing, but inheriting a Rare Class had secured his future. In the Hall Plane, a high-ranking class was akin to *power* or *authority*.

From that moment, users begin to be swayed by that power and authority. Their original goals of survival and returning home start to fade. In a way, the Hall Plane was no different from a modern online game—a role-playing game where you raise stats and acquire better gear.

“No save and load, though.”

“What, hyung?”

“…Just talking to myself.”

Seeing An-hyeon tilt his head, I shut my mouth. For now, it was fine to let him be. Even if it was just fleeting vanity, it would help him grow during this phase. Of course, if he went too far, I’d put on the brakes myself.

As An-hyeon and I chatted, Go Yeon-ju brought out the food, and the rest of the party started coming down one by one. An-sol, Yu-jeong, Vivian, and Shin Sang-yong took their seats, and the table quickly grew lively. Shin Sang-yong, who had been debating with Vivian, glanced around at everyone and spoke with a hint of curiosity.

“Jeong Ha-yeon seems… a bit late.”

“Huh? She wasn’t in the room when I woke up this morning.”

At Yu-jeong’s murmur, Shin Sang-yong’s brow furrowed slightly.

“Really? That’s odd. She’s usually punctual… Could something be wrong?”

This guy… he’s sharper than he looks. Just then, I sensed her presence from upstairs. I licked my lips and pointed to the second floor.

“She’s coming down now.”

As soon as I spoke, the door to the second floor opened, revealing Ha-yeon. The group nodded as they saw her, but their expressions soon turned awkward. She descended the stairs slowly, gripping the railing as if still in pain from yesterday.

Carefully pulling out a chair and sitting down with a hand on her lower abdomen, Ha-yeon drew a concerned look from An-sol.

“Are you feeling unwell?”

“Just a little… my lower stomach hurts.”

“Is it *that* time?”

Yu-jeong’s blunt comment made An-sol and Ha-yeon flinch in embarrassment. Ha-yeon shot me an apologetic glance, and I shook my head. She clearly didn’t want to show it, but she couldn’t hide the throbbing pain. It was probably so bad she could barely stand or walk.

“If the pain gets worse, I can try healing you.”

“I’m not sure if it’ll work, but I’ll ask later.”

The group looked at Ha-yeon with concern. I had worried they might push her or treat her coldly, but the kids were fundamentally kind-hearted. Feeling grateful that I’d chosen party members with good dispositions, I picked up my spoon. As if on cue, the others followed suit, lifting their utensils.

Though it was a simple Course A meal, it was perfect for breakfast. I dipped a piece of bread into the steaming soup. As I put it in my mouth, a savory aroma spread across my tongue. Go Yeon-ju was skilled, and her food was delicious. I mused that having her in the party would be fun as I moved on to the stew.

After the lively breakfast, the group sipped warm tea at the now-cleared table. Their faces looked relaxed. Yesterday, they had been on edge, constantly wary of monsters, but now they seemed to be soaking in the rare peaceful atmosphere.

“So, Leader, what’s the plan moving forward?”

Shin Sang-yong pushed up his glasses and asked, prompting me to organize my thoughts. The upcoming schedule. I had mentioned we’d take a long break this time, but there were still things to do. Since I planned to leave Mul quickly after conquering the Screaming Cave, we needed to handle most tasks beforehand.

The good thing was that I didn’t need to rely on record searches or my *Third Eye*. Having been part of a caravan that discovered the Screaming Cave in my first cycle, I remembered most of the route. Even if I couldn’t recall every detail perfectly, my *Third Eye* would help me find the way.

The only issue was the distance. Assuming we started from Mul, it would take about ten days to reach the cave. Ten days there, ten days back—twenty days total. Factoring in the time to explore the cave, it would likely take at least three weeks. We’d been in Mul for just under a month and a half. That meant our break should last at least two weeks but no more than four. That way, we could return to Mul after the vagrant extermination operation and hear news of the Golden Lion Clan’s expedition to the Steel Mountains.

While I was lost in thought, the table had grown quiet. I looked up to see the group watching me, clearly curious about the next steps. I took a sip of tea to wet my throat and spoke calmly.

“As I mentioned before, we’ll take a slightly longer break this time.”

“I’m all for it.”

Shin Sang-yong smiled warmly and chuckled. The kids seemed subtly relieved, likely feeling the strain of our recent relentless pace. But a break didn’t mean idling. This time was for preparing efficiently for the next expedition.

“Our goals for this break can be divided into three: improving individual skills, preparing for the next expedition, and establishing a clan.”

“Clan establishment?”

Ha-yeon, who had been rubbing her lower abdomen, widened her eyes in surprise. The kids, already aware, remained unfazed, but Shin Sang-yong and Ha-yeon, being new, were hearing this for the first time. Ha-yeon, quick-witted as ever, mulled over my words and nodded, muttering to herself.

“I see… It’s definitely possible. No, it’s practically guaranteed.”

“We’ve succeeded in two expeditions. It’d be strange if we didn’t get approval for a clan. Anyway, this might be new to you two, but… we’ll need to discuss this separately later.”

Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong nodded in unison. I planned to explain what kind of clan mine would be, its purpose, and ask for their intentions. But with Vivian tied to Shin Sang-yong and Ha-yeon tied to me, they were practically already members. It was just a matter of formalities.

“We’ll talk about this in detail later. For now, An-hyeon, An-sol, Yu-jeong.”

“Yes, hyung.”

“Yes, oppa.”

“Yeah, oppa.”

The kids responded like eager fledglings, and I continued without pause.

“During this break, your goal is to improve your skills. Unless I call for you specifically, your focus is training, training, and more training. Especially you, An-hyeon…”

I paused and turned to Vivian. She was sipping tea with an excited expression, only to burn her tongue and flail. I sighed and continued.

“Vivian.”

“Eep… hot… huh?”

“It’s great that you’re teaching Shin Sang-yong, but when you have time, help An-hyeon decipher his record book.”

“Simple decoding? No problem. I’m not teaching him spear techniques anyway.”

Vivian replied breezily. I nodded at her straightforward answer and turned to Ha-yeon.

“Ha-yeon… I’d like you to guide An-sol. Your classes differ, but the basics of mana manipulation are similar. An-sol still has a lot to learn.”

I almost called her by her first name but adjusted to avoid sounding odd to the kids. She didn’t seem to mind.

“Leave it to me.”

“Yes…”

As I felt reassured by their calm responses, Yu-jeong suddenly cut in.

“What about me, oppa?”

“Hm?”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked, and her face immediately showed disappointment as she spoke.

“An-hyeon has his class and a book, fine. An-sol has someone to teach her… Am I supposed to train alone?”

Her words carried a heavy dose of hurt. I paused to think.
