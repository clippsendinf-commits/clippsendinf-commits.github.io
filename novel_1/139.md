# Memorize - Chapter 138: A Meaningful Conclusion

Yujeong’s face was surprisingly calm. Her tone carried a casual air, as if it were no big deal.  
But I could tell—it was a facade, a carefully crafted expression and voice. Her eyes burned quietly with an unreadable desire. A heart steeped in blood. An-hyeon and An-sol were visibly shaken, so it wasn’t as if Yujeong was devoid of emotion. She was simply burying it deep within her chest.  

Yujeong glanced at my face, gave a faint smile, and spoke.  
“When did she get that Secret Class? When she was with us? Or after she joined the Golden Lion Clan?”  

Go Yeon-ju subtly slipped in additional information, and I shook my head slightly at her. Sometimes, I couldn’t help but think Go Yeon-ju had a mischievous streak.  
“From what I’ve gathered, she awakened to it before entering the User Academy. It’s not confirmed, though. Only she would know the details.”  

Yujeong let out a scoff at Go Yeon-ju’s words. “I see. No wonder she was so confident joining the Golden Lion Clan. She had something to rely on. I never would’ve guessed. That sly girl.”  

“Yeah,” An-hyeon chimed in, his tone laced with thorns, clearly bitter. “We went through the Rite of Passage together, so it stings a bit.”  

Despite having obtained a Rare Class himself, An-hyeon seemed envious. I felt the need to defend Kim Han-byeol, if only slightly. There was always a chance we might recruit her later, and if their current impressions of her solidified, it could cause significant friction down the line.  

“Don’t judge her too harshly,” I said. “If you look at it objectively, her choice made sense. We were starting from the bottom, while the Golden Lion Clan, already at the top, made her an offer. I’m disappointed too, but let’s not nitpick.”  

“Oppa, are you taking her side?” Yujeong asked, her voice sharp.  

“I’m not taking her side. I’m saying we should respect her choice. There’s no need to get so emotional about it. What matters now is us.”  

“Hmph…”  

I spoke in a soothing tone to calm them down. Yujeong tilted her head with a skeptical expression but eventually let out a faint hum and nodded. Beside her, An-sol murmured, “If Orabeoni says so…” Her words made a corner of my heart uneasy. Why were they all so hard on Kim Han-byeol?  

To be honest, I’d felt a twinge of betrayal back then too—when I realized she’d obtained a Secret Class and chose not to follow me. But as time passed and I thought it over, I found no reason to blame her. Kim Han-byeol had made a rational choice based on her circumstances. There was no reason for her to reject the Golden Lion Clan’s offer to follow me.  

That was the logical, objective perspective. But the others were still caught up in their emotions. Like I had, they’d need time to come to terms with it. Once they grew more experienced and understood the Hall Plane better, their feelings toward her might soften. For now, I decided to change the subject.  

“Anyway, a storm’s about to hit the western cities, centered around Halo. A large-scale battle between users and vagrants is coming. Mul, being the northernmost minor city, is unlikely to be affected, but the atmosphere will likely be tense for a while. So, we’ll be heading out to explore for the time being. Getting caught up in this mess isn’t a good idea.”  

“You’re right,” Jeong Ha-yeon nodded. “With the Warp Gates active, it’s not entirely safe either. Still, a large-scale battle will probably take some time. Where are we headed next?”  

I nodded at her pertinent question and answered promptly.  
“Our next destination is the Cave of Screams. After thoroughly reviewing the library records, I’ve determined there’s a high chance it exists. From Mul’s north gate, we’ll head across the plains and then east. This expedition will take some time, though—the distance is considerable.”  

The Cave of Screams was about a ten-day journey one way. Even if clearing the cave itself didn’t take long, the round trip would take at least three weeks. We’d been in Mul for nearly two months now, so I planned to leave before the first week of the third month. By the time we returned, the vagrant extermination plan would likely be over.  

At the mention of a three-week round trip, the group’s expressions shifted subtly. Compared to the dungeons we’d explored before, this was several times longer, and I worried they might be hesitant. But to my surprise, they all showed signs of excited anticipation.  

Perhaps they’d grown restless during the relatively long preparation period. Their skills had improved, and they likely wanted to test their abilities. Relieved by their reactions, I continued calmly.  

“That said, I’d like everyone to wrap up their current tasks within three days. We don’t know how the situation might change. The western cities are already in a state of war, so it’s best to prepare quickly and be ready to leave as early as tomorrow.”  

At that moment, Go Yeon-ju raised her hand, her expression languid as she spoke. Her subtle cunning left me inwardly shaking my head. Had no one else noticed?  

“User Kim Su-hyeon, I have a question.”  

“Go ahead.”  

“You said the round trip will take three weeks. It’s not quite an expedition, but the duration is similar to a small-scale one. From what you’ve said, it sounds like you’re assuming we’ll definitely find the cave. What if we don’t?”  

Her words prompted nods of agreement from Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong. Her point was valid. I knew the locations of dungeons from my past experience and could find them with my Third Eye, but to other users, this was unthinkable.  

The others, however, looked puzzled by her question. Having worked with me for so long, they didn’t seem to think finding a dungeon was particularly difficult. Still, saying outright, “I know exactly where the dungeon is, so just trust me,” would lack credibility, so I opted for a diplomatic response.  

“User Go Yeon-ju’s point is valid, but our primary goal is to avoid the Golden Lion Clan’s movements and leave the city. I don’t want us getting swept up in the chaos. That said, I’m not giving up on the Cave of Screams. I researched it thoroughly, just like I did for the Dungeon of the Ancient Alchemist Vivian and the Ruined Laboratory. And the Cave of Screams has an even higher likelihood of existing than those two.”  

“Hmm. So the primary goal is to leave the city. Are you saying we should just trust you?”  

“Yes. And…”  

I paused and glanced at An-sol, who was fidgeting with her hands. Her innocent demeanor made me chuckle softly before I continued in a relaxed tone.  

“We’ve got a lucky charm with us, just in case.”  

“Lucky charm?”  

“Huh?”  

Go Yeon-ju raised an eyebrow, while An-sol, who had been playing with her hands, snapped her head up at the mention of “lucky charm.” Seeing her tilt her head with wide, curious eyes, I let out a subtle smile. The others began looking at An-sol with similar expressions. Having benefited greatly from her luck in finding the Ruined Laboratory, they seemed to have some expectations.  

As the group’s attention focused on her, An-sol pouted, and Go Yeon-ju furrowed her brow with an unreadable expression.  

“Sigh. Fine, I don’t care. But if this goes south, I’m taking every bit of the inn’s profits and maintenance costs, so you’d better make it work.”  

“Of course. Any other questions?”  

“Yes, one more.”  

What was with all these questions? Just as I thought that, I caught a faint smile on Go Yeon-ju’s lips. Then I felt Ha-yeon’s gaze and turned to see her giving me a wry smile. It seemed only she and I had noticed what was going on.  

I nodded to signal Go Yeon-ju to ask her question, and she stood up slightly from her seat.  

“Why am I here?”  

…  

……  

………  

““““Huh?””””  

Except for Ha-yeon and me, everyone’s eyes widened, and one by one, their mouths dropped open. Go Yeon-ju, who had been preparing breakfast, had seamlessly inserted herself into our conversation, asking questions and making comments. She’d blended in so subtly that it seemed only Ha-yeon and I had noticed.  

“Ho ho. I’ll go get breakfast.”  

Leaving the stunned group behind, Go Yeon-ju glided toward the kitchen with a light step.  

---  

It was the night before the expedition. Three days ago, I’d declared the end of our preparation period, and I’d spent the time tying up loose ends. Rather than handling external matters, I focused on organizing things within the clan. I checked each member’s condition, ensuring any potential issues or conflicts were addressed beforehand. It was far better to resolve things now than to let them erupt during the expedition.  

In doing so, I discovered a new source of tension—between Go Yeon-ju and An-sol. It wasn’t quite a conflict, but there was something subtle at play.  

I’d only recently noticed, but An-sol seemed wary of Go Yeon-ju. She particularly avoided being alone with her. When Ha-yeon was around, An-sol was relatively calm, but if Go Yeon-ju got even slightly close, An-sol would find any excuse to leave. I’d been leaving her to Ha-yeon and hadn’t paid much attention, and on the surface, it didn’t seem like a major issue. But something about it felt off, and I didn’t want to leave it unaddressed before the expedition.  

I tried asking An-sol about it a few times, but she’d blush, shake her head, and refuse to answer, insisting it was nothing and not to worry. It didn’t seem like she was avoiding Go Yeon-ju out of dislike—there was something else at play. I wanted to resolve it, but since she wasn’t forthcoming, I decided to observe for now.  

Meanwhile, Yujeong had been training under Go Yeon-ju up until the day before the expedition. I suggested she rest since we were leaving tomorrow, but Yujeong insisted on continuing her training. Go Yeon-ju readily agreed, though she promised to go easy on her since it was the day before departure. Knowing Yujeong’s progress and Go Yeon-ju’s approach, I didn’t have much to say. The expedition was important, but with Go Yeon-ju and me present, there was little risk of danger. In the end, I allowed Yujeong’s request.  

Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced by Go Yeon-ju’s assurances, so I waited in a corner of the first floor for Yujeong to appear. If I stayed there, I’d naturally run into An-sol when she came down to heal Yujeong, and I could check on Yujeong’s condition at the same time.  

After waiting in the dimly lit lobby for a while, I heard An-sol’s cautious footsteps descending the stairs. She glanced around nervously before perching lightly on a table across from the kitchen. She didn’t seem to notice me in the corner.  

A bit more time passed, and then the kitchen door swung open with a bang. Go Yeon-ju emerged, carrying Yujeong over her shoulder. From the looks of it, Yujeong had fainted again. I sighed inwardly, unsure where Go Yeon-ju’s idea of “going easy” came from. I’d anticipated this and had a high-quality healing potion ready. I touched the potion in my pocket and quietly watched them.  

Go Yeon-ju, with a languid expression, looked at An-sol and spoke in a gentle tone.  
“You’re here, little one. It’s late. Here to heal this kid again?”  

“Y-Yes…”  

An-sol nodded, her face tense with apprehension. Go Yeon-ju covered her lips and gave a soft smile.  
“Ho ho. I’m not going to eat you, so don’t be so nervous. I went easy on her today, so she doesn’t need healing. She’ll be fine by tomorrow. Just toss her into her bed at the lodge.”  

“Y-Yes… I’ll take her then.”  

“Oh, leaving so soon? That’s a bit disappointing. Come here for a moment. I’m sorry about last time—I was just so surprised. But I understand.”  

Go Yeon-ju approached An-sol with a captivating smile. I couldn’t fathom what had happened between them to make her act this way.  

And then, An-sol let out a scream and bolted.  

“…”  

Go Yeon-ju stared blankly as An-sol sprinted up the stairs. I sighed and stepped out from the corner. Her reaction was more intense than I’d expected.  

“We’ll talk about what happened later,” I said, hoisting the unconscious Yujeong over my shoulder. Go Yeon-ju turned to me with a wronged expression, shrugging her shoulders.
