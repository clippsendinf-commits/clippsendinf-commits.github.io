# Memorize - Episode 2 (2/1068): Zero Code, Turning Back Ten Years of Time

As the light relentlessly pounding my eyelids began to weaken, I slowly opened my eyes, which I had kept tightly shut. The radiance that had filled the entire room was now fading, leaving only a faint glow. After blinking once or twice, my blurry vision gradually came into focus. Once I could discern objects clearly enough, I began to calmly survey my surroundings.

*It’s different.*

In the brief moment I had closed my eyes, everything had changed. The sword I held in my right hand and the equipment I wore were gone, vanished without a trace. As I lowered my gaze to my empty hand, I saw a camouflage-patterned military uniform. The moment I noticed the insignia on my left chest, I held my breath. That’s when I heard it.

“Code Name Zero. Complete. The activation of the Zero Code has been confirmed. Successful activation verified. Congratulations, User Kim Su-hyeon.”

Raising my head at the familiar voice, I saw Seraph gazing at me, still seated on the altar. In that instant, I couldn’t help but frown slightly. Even at a glance, her condition was far from normal—it was severe.

“Why are you looking at me like that?”

Her once-beautifully shimmering white wings were now so faint they were barely visible, and her entire body was translucent, revealing the background unobstructed. Only her expressionless face remained as it always had been.

As I maintained my silence, Seraph tilted her head and spoke.

“It’s been a while since I’ve seen such concern in your eyes. But it’s alright. It is currently Thursday, December 27, 2011, Earth time. As per your request, you have returned to the moment when Earth’s Kim Su-hyeon first entered the Summoning Room. I reiterate, User Kim Su-hyeon’s request has been successfully processed and completed.”

“So… that’s how it is. Then, Seraph, did you come back with me?”

As I spoke softly, Seraph slowly shook her head.

“I cannot say precisely, but for now, I’ll answer ‘No.’ There are still matters I need to explain to User Kim Su-hyeon, so I requested a brief extension from the Zero Code. Fortunately, the Zero Code deemed my request reasonable and granted it.”

“Something to explain?”

“Yes, indeed.”

When I asked with a furrowed brow, Seraph responded with a gentle smile—the first smile I had ever seen from an angel in my ten years in the Hall Plane. The sudden, refreshing feeling made me unconsciously relax my frown.

An awkward silence settled for a moment. But it was Seraph, not me, who broke it first. Brushing her silver hair behind her ear and half-closing her eyes, she spoke quietly.

“I remember the day User Kim Su-hyeon was first summoned to the Hall Plane. Do you recall the first words you said when you saw me?”

“No clue.”

How could I remember something like that? I had no idea what nonsense she was getting at, but I decided to listen quietly for now. As a “guide,” Seraph had always provided sound advice.

“You said, ‘W-Where am I? W-Who are you?’”

“Geez, even the stuttering? You remember the weirdest things.”

“Hehe. That’s not all. There’s more…”

*Crackle!*

At that moment, a sound like tearing space interrupted her trivial chatter, and Seraph’s entire form distorted violently. It resembled the static noise of a TV with a bad connection. 

“Ugh!”

Her body twisted and then returned to normal. Seraph let out a pained groan. The distortion repeated, her translucency worsening each time. Her appearance felt so unfamiliar. I half-expected her to revert to her usual serene demeanor if I blinked, but the Seraph before me now looked as precarious as a candle flickering in the wind.

As the noise finally subsided, Seraph, barely regaining her composure, wore a bittersweet expression.

“It seems unlikely that the Zero Code will grant me further leniency. Even after ten years together… it doesn’t allow time for farewells.”

*This is really hard to get used to.*

In the past, she would have skipped such sentiments and gone straight to the point. Angels, as Seraph herself said, always acted rationally. Seeing her suddenly change after ten years of consistency was jarring.

“Alright… then just explain quickly and be done with it.”

In the end, I snapped brusquely. Seraph gazed at me with sorrowful eyes, then let out a short sigh and continued.

“User Kim Su-hyeon has barely used GP since the mid-point. We plan to expend some of your accumulated points to grant you certain privileges as you restart.”

“Hm? Privileges?”

“Of course, your remaining GP will be preserved as well.”

“Privileges, huh… I don’t know what they are, but I guess you’re giving me some respect for having reached the end once. Makes me tear up with gratitude.”

My tone dripped with sarcasm, but Seraph shook her head slightly, as if to say that wasn’t it.

“Rather than respect, I’d appreciate it if you considered it a gesture of goodwill. All the angels, including myself, fully understand, empathize with, and sympathize with your feelings.”

“Sympathize? Haha…”

“If the word ‘sympathize’ offends you, I apologize. There was no intent to belittle you. But within the Hall Plane, angels are tasked with aiding users. Have I ever given you advice that seemed harmful, even once? Think carefully. Whether you accept this goodwill or let it pass is entirely up to User Kim Su-hyeon.”

She said it was up to me, but Seraph was clearly determined to ensure I accepted these “privileges,” leaving no room for argument. With no real counter to offer, I nodded reluctantly, feeling a bit uneasy.

“An excellent choice. I firmly believe this decision will make achieving your goals significantly easier.”

The moment I agreed, Seraph’s eyes softened with relief, and she smiled faintly. Her barely visible wings fluttered once with force. The distance between us closed instantly, and I felt a soft touch on my head. Looking up, I saw Seraph continue in a calm voice.

“Please bear with it, even if it’s unpleasant. We don’t have much time left. I will directly input and transmit the information into your mind.”

As soon as she finished speaking, a jolt flashed through the crown of my head where her hand rested. It wasn’t painful. Rather, miraculously, the information she intended to convey flowed clearly into my mind. I closed my eyes and quietly absorbed it.

**<User Kim Su-hyeon Exclusive Privilege Settings (Tanay)>**

1. **Stat Privileges**: User Kim Su-hyeon will be granted privileges regarding their original stat information. First, you may “load” the user information achieved in your first cycle. Second, four out of the six basic stat categories will be randomly selected for an upward adjustment, with the degree of increase also determined randomly.

2. **Class Privileges**: Before entering the Rite of Passage, you may pre-select your class. This includes not only standard classes but also Rare and Secret classes, as well as all hidden classes.

3. **Special and Potential Ability Privileges**: Typically, users have one Special Ability slot and four Potential Ability slots. For User Kim Su-hyeon, an additional Potential Ability slot will be unlocked. All Special and Potential Abilities, including hidden ones, will be available for selection as desired. Alternatively, you may unlock a “Unique Ability” slot, which is a higher-tier ability than Special Abilities. If you forgo the Unique Ability, you may choose one Special Ability and all five Potential Abilities freely (the additional slot will automatically count as a Potential Ability). However, if you choose to take a Unique Ability, it will consume one Potential Ability slot, and only half of the remaining four slots (two slots) can be chosen freely, with the other two determined randomly.

4. **One-Time Physical Augmentation**: You may undergo a body modification procedure once.

5. **Equipment Selection**: User Kim Su-hyeon may select one piece of equipment of their choice, with no restrictions on type. However, EX-rank equipment is not available.

The flood of privilege-related information filled my mind without pause. When I opened my eyes, I could only see a faint afterimage of Seraph. Her hand still rested on my head, but the sensation from before was gone.

After barely sorting through the transmitted information, I let out a quiet exclamation.

“This is…”

Honestly, I hadn’t even dreamed of receiving such privileges, so I was slightly dumbfounded. Starting with these advantages would be akin to editing a character before beginning a game.

Perhaps reading my expression, Seraph smiled faintly and said, “These privileges were created using the points you earned. I won’t deny that some of my goodwill is mixed in, but there’s no issue, as they were approved by all the angels.”

“I’m all for it, but you’re disappearing soon, aren’t you? Won’t this cause balance issues?”

“No, it won’t. And I detected a hint of arrogance in your tone just now. As I’ve said repeatedly over the past ten years, complacency is never acceptable.”

“I’ll be careful. But seriously, think about it—balance issues. What would people think if a brand-new user started with these privileges?”

“That issue is resolved by Tanay, so there’s no need to worry. As for balance… well, balance was considered, but…” 

Seraph paused, glancing at me cautiously before continuing in a hesitant tone.

“Considering the potential User Kim Su-hyeon originally possessed, this could actually be seen as balancing things out.”

Her words carried layers of meaning, but I understood immediately. After all, “potential” is the most critical factor in determining “user information.”

I could grasp her intent, but why did it leave a bitter taste in my mouth?

No one can deny that I reached the pinnacle of the Hall Plane, the only user to do so. I won’t pretend it wasn’t built on countless miracles and coincidences. But as the old saying goes, it’s not the strong who survive, but the survivors who are strong.

When it comes to conventional strength, I could confidently say I was strong. Not the absolute strongest, perhaps—I knew that well. But even so…

“…Hmph.”

“Arrogance is forbidden. Don’t let your guard down.”

So that’s what Seraph was getting at. I felt a bit sheepish, wondering if I had indeed been arrogant. I let out a short sigh and nodded. She wasn’t wrong, after all. My pride stung a little, but seeing Seraph’s form, now so faint it was barely recognizable, softened my feelings.

“Now… it’s truly time… to part…”

As Seraph said, the end had come. Her form twisted and flickered like a TV screen on the verge of breaking. She no longer returned to normal. I could only watch helplessly.

“Farewell… you… must… I hope…”

Her words grew fainter, her presence fading. Yet Seraph spoke to me with desperate urgency.

“That… truly…”

“Seraph, I hate to say this at the end, but I can’t hear you well.”

My words seemed to reach her, as sadness clouded her face. But in this moment, there was nothing I could do. This was the outcome I had wanted, the situation I had brought upon myself. Still, she didn’t give up.

“Please… be…”

*Pop!*

The noise intensified, and suddenly a brilliant white light flashed with a *pop*. Radiant beams of light branched out around Seraph, only to vanish instantly. As the true end approached, she bit her lip once, then, with determination in her eyes, parted her lips.

“Be happy…”

*Shhh…*

With those final words, Seraph vanished. No more noise followed. But her last, heartfelt words rang clearly in my ears. I thought I saw her smile brightly at me in that final moment, but I was too focused on her words to notice.

For a brief moment, I stared blankly at the spot where Seraph had been.
