# Memorize - Chapter 14: Split in Half

“Instead of worrying about the people who left, let’s focus on ourselves for now. Wouldn’t it be better to head down the hill and get out of this forest first?”

The words weren’t directed at everyone but specifically at An-hyeon. As my gaze settled on him, Yu-jeong and Han-byeol naturally turned their eyes toward him as well. An-hyeon, perhaps used to taking charge in tough situations, didn’t seem fazed by the attention. Nodding readily, he stood up and peered down the hill.

“Going down sounds good, but I’m not sure which direction we should take. We don’t even know where we are right now…”

Lifting his head, An-hyeon alternated his gaze between the clearing teeming with Deadmen and the path Park Dong-geol’s group had taken. The direction Park Dong-geol chose was directly opposite the clearing. It seemed like a calculated move on his part, but in my opinion, it was far from a wise choice.

“That way might be better.”

At that moment, Han-byeol, who had been quiet until now, pointed in a specific direction. Following her finger, I saw she was indicating a path roughly ninety degrees from the clearing. Yu-jeong, gauging the distance to the clearing, asked with a hint of unease, “Wouldn’t it be safer to go in the complete opposite direction of the clearing? That path doesn’t seem far enough from it.”

Looks like we’ve got another one thinking like Park Dong-geol.

An-hyeon pondered for a moment before letting out a soft “Ah!” He didn’t strike me as the studious type, but his quick thinking was impressive. Noticing Yu-jeong’s puzzled expression, Han-byeol calmly explained, “It’s simple. Right now, most of those things are gathered in the clearing. If we assume the creatures are evenly distributed throughout the forest, the areas where they’re concentrated mean other spots are likely less populated. The safest bet would be around here.”

“The opposite direction from the clearing might still have monsters that didn’t hear the commotion earlier. It could actually be more dangerous,” An-hyeon added.

Han-byeol nodded slightly, as if agreeing with his point. Their escape route wasn’t exactly the same as mine, but it was close enough. For the first time, I felt things were starting to move in the right direction, and I allowed myself a small, inward smile.

“Now that you mention it, that makes sense. So, the direction that jerk went might actually be the most dangerous?” Yu-jeong said.

“Exactly. Let’s head straight down this way and get out of the forest. Sol, get up.”

“Huh? Oh!”

An-sol, who had been quietly sucking her finger like a child, scrambled to her feet at An-hyeon’s command. Seeing An-hyeon and me take charge, no one seemed to have any major complaints. In fact, the group’s mood felt more stable and relaxed compared to when Park Dong-geol was around. Yu-jeong, in particular, seemed to find Park Dong-geol’s likely struggles amusing, a faint smile playing on her lips.

With that, the remaining group—myself, An-hyeon, An-sol, Yu-jeong, and Han-byeol—quickly descended the hill.

*

About two hours had passed since we decided on our escape route and started down the hill. The forest was dense, with towering trees stretching high enough to block out the sky, making it much darker than it had seemed from the hilltop. For two hours, we trekked through the dim forest without pause. With each step, the only sounds were the rustle of dirt and grass beneath our feet and the steady rhythm of our breathing as the others followed An-hyeon and me at the front.

The forest was eerily quiet and far larger than I’d expected. But based on my memory and our current pace, I estimated we could exit the forest by evening if we kept moving. It occurred to me that the angels might have deliberately dropped us in the heart of a high-difficulty forest, given the decent stats of our group.

Our priority was to escape the forest before nightfall. The Preparation Room had provided clothing and weapons, but no food or water. Those essentials could be found elsewhere—either in a Rest Room for a half-day break or a Save Point for a full day of rest. Alternatively, we could raid other Users or scavenge shops in a town.

“…Oppa.”

“Yeah?”

An-hyeon and I were at the front, with An-sol and Han-byeol close behind, while Yu-jeong brought up the rear, all of us staying vigilant. Suddenly, An-sol tugged at An-hyeon’s sleeve, her face flushed as she mumbled, “I need to… you know…”

Her shy admission brought an awkward silence to the group.

*Is she an idiot?*

She’d seemed a bit clueless, but this was next-level. I couldn’t help but wonder how she’d managed back in the modern world.

An-hyeon paused, glancing at the rest of us. “Can we stop for a moment? My sister needs to take care of something.”

Thankfully, Yu-jeong and Han-byeol nodded without objection. There must be some unspoken understanding among women. An-sol, clearly scared to go alone, begged An-hyeon to come with her, but he firmly sent her off by herself, causing a small scene.

Watching An-sol trudge off, looking dejected after her brother’s scolding, Yu-jeong let out a chuckle. She’d already plopped down on the ground.

“Is that okay? What if those things come after her?” Yu-jeong asked.

“She’ll be fine if we keep watch. Besides, she’s nineteen—she should be able to handle going to the bathroom alone,” An-hyeon replied. “By the way, how old are you, talking so casually?”

“Me? Twenty-two. You’re one to talk, using informal speech yourself. Wait, aren’t you younger than me? You look barely twenty or twenty-one.”

“I’m twenty-two too.”

“No way! We’re the same age? Since we’re at it, why don’t we all introduce ourselves?”

Yu-jeong’s voice was noticeably brighter, and even Han-byeol, perhaps weary from the tension, cautiously sat down beside her. An-hyeon and I exchanged a nod and joined them on the cold ground.

“We’ll head out as soon as my sister’s back, so let’s keep it quick,” An-hyeon said. “I’m An-hyeon, twenty-two years old.”

“What did you do before coming here?” Yu-jeong asked.

An-hyeon scratched his cheek, looking a bit embarrassed, but answered honestly. “I was just a neighborhood delinquent, doing odd jobs. You?”

“Me? I’m Yu-jeong, also twenty-two. I was on a break from university, preparing for the police officer exam.”

A police officer exam—dreaming of being a cop, huh? Somehow, I could picture Yu-jeong in a police uniform, and it suited her. As the two chatted about cops and delinquents, their attention turned to Han-byeol and me. Unable to resist their curious stares, Han-byeol spoke first.

“I’m Kim Han-byeol, twenty-one. A university student.”

“You’re younger? Which university?” Yu-jeong asked.

“Yonsei University.”

“Wow, you must be super smart. I’m jealous!”

After a moment of admiration, their gazes shifted to me. Even Han-byeol looked at me expectantly. Feeling the pressure, I kept my expression calm and met their expectations. “I’m Kim Su-hyeon, twenty-three. I was a soldier.”

“Found an oppa!” Yu-jeong exclaimed. “So, you can talk casually now, right? Were you in the army, air force, or navy?”

“You’re older, huh? You can talk casually with me too,” An-hyeon added. “What was your rank?”

He’d seemed bold earlier, but Yu-jeong’s bubbly nature was something else. An-hyeon, intrigued by the mention of the military, pressed further.

“Army sergeant,” I replied.

“Man, you were so close to discharge,” Yu-jeong said with a laugh.

I gave a wry smile and added, “I did get discharged. I was on my way back home after reporting it when I ended up here.”

“…”

“…”

“…”

What’s with those pitying looks? This heavy atmosphere?

“Why are you all staring like that? I’m fine, really. Stop looking at me like that.”

Despite my protests, an awkward silence settled over us. An-hyeon cleared his throat and looked away, while Yu-jeong openly gave me a sympathetic look. Even Han-byeol’s gaze was tinged with pity. I was genuinely fine, though.

To break the mood, Yu-jeong deliberately brightened her tone. “This place still feels like a dream. Normally, I’d be studying in the library, then slamming my books shut, rushing out to meet friends, chatting in the lounge, grabbing some good food, and promising myself to study harder tomorrow.”

Her words brought a dreamy look to everyone’s faces. An-hyeon gave a soft chuckle, joining in. “I’d probably be at my PC bang job, arguing with customers trying to skip out on paying, chasing down the ones who bolt, getting chewed out by the boss for not cleaning well enough, then eating a whole chicken from the boss’s wife while sitting at the counter, waiting for Sol to pick me up. Ugh. What about you, hyung? What were you planning to do when you got home?”

“Me?” I tilted my head, caught off guard by An-hyeon’s question. It had been over ten years, so my memory was fuzzy. After a moment’s thought, I answered plainly. “Probably just soaking in the fact that I was finally free, breathing in the air of society. I’d go home, bow deeply to my mom, call my dad, eat a delicious home-cooked meal, and soak in a hot bath… Okay, seriously, stop looking at me like I’m some pitiful animal. I’m fine, I swear.”

The commotion ended without incident when An-sol returned from her business. She politely bowed, saying, “I’m back,” which I found oddly endearing. But her return was a signal for us to face reality again. Our brief introductions and chatter had been a momentary escape from this hellish place. An-hyeon let out a heavy sigh and got to his feet.

After a sweet, fleeting rest, we resumed our trek through the dark forest. Though An-hyeon and I were at the front, I was subtly guiding the way, steering us toward areas with fewer Deadmen based on my detection. So far, we hadn’t encountered a single one.

But we couldn’t avoid them forever. The closer we got to the forest’s edge, the more evenly distributed the Deadmen became. All I could do was lead us in the direction with the fewest. My biggest concern was An-sol. Even if we took the safest route, we might still run into dozens of Deadmen further ahead. I wasn’t sure if she could stay calm in that situation.

Suddenly, An-hyeon let out a sharp cry and froze. “What’s wrong?” I asked.

“Shh.”

Following his gesture, Yu-jeong and I turned to see three Deadmen prowling nearby. Their twitching noses and smacking lips confirmed they’d caught our scent. I glanced at An-sol, who had both hands clamped over her mouth, eyes squeezed shut. We’d dodged a bullet for now.

“They can track us with their sense of smell, not just sight and sound?” Yu-jeong whispered.

“Seems like it. Duck down,” An-hyeon replied.

He quickly pulled An-sol into his arms and hid behind a large tree. Yu-jeong, Han-byeol, and I followed suit, crouching low and waiting for the Deadmen to pass. I saw An-hyeon grip his shield tightly, but I shook my head. Training to fight Deadmen could wait until we were out of the forest. I couldn’t recall exactly why, but I remembered warnings from others: *Never fight in the forest during the Rite of Passage.*

Based on my detection, we were about halfway to the forest’s edge. We’d avoided trouble so far, but engaging these Deadmen now could draw more, surrounding us. Even if we fought, we’d need to take them out instantly to avoid signaling others, but with just rocks and shields, taking down three at once was a tall order. My longsword rattled faintly at my waist—I regretted not giving it to An-hyeon earlier. Meanwhile, the Deadmen, sniffing the air, inched closer to our hiding spot, step by step.
