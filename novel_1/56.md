# Memorize - Chapter 55: Dungeon of Alchemist (2)

Despite the considerable time that had passed, we were able to move without any interruptions. As we ventured deeper into the Black Forest, I noticed that the dark blue hue of the leaves and underbrush was gradually fading. This was proof that we were making progress through the middle section of the forest. Having significantly increased our marching speed compared to yesterday, it seemed we would cross the midpoint faster than expected.

“That’s strange. I’m sure I saw a ton of monsters in my dream last night,” An-hyeon said, tilting his head.

“Huff, huff. They say dreams are the opposite of reality, oppa. Sorry, but can we take a break? It’s been half a day already, and we haven’t stopped once,” Yu-jeong said, panting.

An-sol, though silent, had a pale face with visible bite marks on her lips. They had all followed me without complaint, but it was clear they’d been holding back their fatigue. Feeling the need for a proper rest, I nodded, paused my steps, and scanned our surroundings. The moment I gave my permission, I heard the sound of them collapsing onto the ground.

The traces of the caravan were still evident. The near absence of monsters suggested that the distance between us and the caravan was closing. It was possible that the caravan ahead had already dealt with the monsters. However, this raised two questions.

If they had information about the Alchemist’s Dungeon, was it necessary to clear out all the surrounding monsters? And if they had fought monsters, why were there no corpses in sight? These were questions based on my perspective, but I could hypothesize several possible answers.

After pondering for a while, I smacked my lips and cleared my mind. Dwelling on it now wouldn’t yield answers. The conclusion was clear: follow the caravan’s trail and reach the Alchemist’s Dungeon as quickly as possible. In the worst case, they might not have conquered the dungeon but merely entered it. However, based on my memories and the circumstances, success was more likely than failure. Besides, we had little to lose. Even if we thought of this as merely gaining combat experience, there was nothing to regret.

As I sorted through my complicated thoughts and prepared to rest, I heard a slight commotion from the group already seated. Turning my head, I saw An-sol looking at me with an awkward expression, silently pleading for help.

“Why are you curious about useless things? Just focus on yourself,” An-hyeon said.

“Are you crazy? Don’t you know knowledge is power? You ignorant jerk,” Yu-jeong retorted.

“There’s a saying that knowledge is power, sure. But coming from you, it just doesn’t fit. I think ignorance is your medicine,” An-hyeon shot back.

“What did you say?”

An-hyeon and Yu-jeong were bickering as usual. From what I could tell, the current hot topic was the Golden Lion Clan and the Steel Mountains expedition. While I agreed with An-hyeon’s point given our current reality, I thought it wouldn’t hurt to explain a bit to the group.

“Idiot. Do you think we’re strong enough for an expedition? We’d just get ignored, sucking our thumbs and watching from the sidelines,” Yu-jeong said.

“Who said anything about that? I’m just curious why they’re so desperate to go on this expedition and march forward,” An-hyeon replied.

“Didn’t I just say? You’re curious about useless things. Didn’t you hear what Su-hyeon oppa said? Focus on our situation. Or what, are you feeling inferior to Kim Han-byeol?”

“What? You little…”

As the atmosphere grew tense, I stepped in and sat down with a thud. Yu-jeong, about to unleash a string of curses, saw me and quickly shut her mouth, looking startled. An-hyeon scratched his cheek, avoiding my gaze. I stared at them both calmly before speaking in a composed tone.

“There’s nothing wrong with being curious. In the Hall Plane, information is as good as life itself. Of course, if you’re asking out of mere curiosity or because you want to join the expedition, that’s a problem.”

At my words, Yu-jeong’s face brightened, likely thinking I was taking her side. An-hyeon, on the other hand, pouted and looked sullen. Yu-jeong flashed a triumphant smile before turning to me and speaking.

“Oppa, what’s the big deal about the Steel Mountains that everyone’s making such a fuss about? Back at the inn, it’s all anyone talked about.”

I gathered my thoughts briefly before answering.

“Right now, the Hall Plane is limited to the East, West, South, and North Continents. There’s a need to advance to the Central Continent, and to do that, we have to conquer the Steel Mountains.”

“Then why not just conquer it?” Yu-jeong asked.

An-hyeon interjected, “You idiot.”

I gave a bitter smile at Yu-jeong’s words and continued.

“If it were that easy, it would’ve been done already. They say the mountains are home to monsters far beyond anything we’ve encountered—beasts we can’t even imagine.”

“So, if we cross the Steel Mountains, we can reach the Central Continent? And what’s in the Central Continent?” Yu-jeong pressed.

Her relentless questions made me pause. Though An-hyeon and An-sol tried to hide it, their curious expressions betrayed them. I decided I needed to be careful with my words, but since we were resting and it wouldn’t hurt for them to know this much, I continued slowly.

“I don’t know the details. Even if we cross the Steel Mountains, we don’t know if the Central Continent will appear immediately or if there’s another preparatory continent. What we do know, from ancient texts, is that there’s a major city called Atlanta in front of the North Continent. It’s just old documents, but the idea of a new major city has users fired up and eager to charge in.”

“Atlanta… What’s so great about taking a major city? Can we go home if we conquer it?” Yu-jeong asked.

“No one knows that. But let me ask you something, Yu-jeong. What do you think is the most important thing for surviving in the Hall Plane as an individual?”

Yu-jeong closed her eyes, twirling her hair with her finger as she thought, then answered, “Strength. Ability. Stats.”

“Exactly. An individual’s ability is crucial. Having strength doesn’t guarantee survival, but it definitely increases your chances.”

“Right. So, does that mean the users who take Atlanta can gain more strength?”

I nodded at Yu-jeong’s eager response and continued.

“Something like that. The North Continent is gradually reaching a saturation point. A continent doesn’t have infinite dungeons. Most expeditions have already been completed. Sure, Mul was discovered recently, but due to the Steel Mountains and its status as a minor city, it gets relatively little attention. Once Mul and other cities are fully stabilized, there’ll be nothing left to do. All that’s left is hunting the occasional monster. It’s the same for the other continents. When the North Continent reaches full saturation and development, users won’t be able to grow their strength or abilities further. And if we can’t get stronger in a place where returning home is uncertain, who knows what’ll happen? Plus, we won’t be able to train new users who have the potential to become strong.”

I spoke at length, but it still felt insufficient. Clearing my throat, I looked at the group, who were listening intently, and continued.

“So, if we conquer the Steel Mountains and pioneer Atlanta, we’ll gain new ground to develop. New monsters, new expeditions, new dungeons, new equipment, and so on. Right now, our stats are relatively low, so we can improve them more easily. But later, when we hit our limits, raising stats becomes incredibly tough. I heard that when the major city of Barbara was pioneered a few years ago, everyone who participated got a stat boost as a reward for their achievement, plus a ton of other lucrative rewards. That’s why they’re so desperate to cross the Steel Mountains.”

Of course, even after conquering Atlanta, there’s another hurdle to overcome. At that point, we’d have to compete with users from other continents. The thought of the sacrifices made to obtain the Zero Code in Terra, the major city of the Central Continent surrounded by Atlanta and Ragnarok, sent a shiver down my spine.

When I finished, the group stared at me with stunned expressions, mouths agape, clearly shocked. An-hyeon, blinking rapidly, snapped out of it and spoke in a slightly urgent tone.

“Hyung, doesn’t that mean we should’ve stayed in the major city? I’m not doubting your choice, but hearing you talk, the benefits sound incredible. If we built up our strength in Barbara and joined the expedition, even at the tail end…”

“Yeah, exactly. That Kim Han-byeol must be looking down on us right now. Ugh, it pisses me off just thinking about it,” Yu-jeong added.

So it was about Kim Han-byeol after all. An-hyeon and Yu-jeong showed signs of agitation, but An-sol alone gazed at me with unwavering trust in her eyes. After this morning’s events, it seemed she believed in me unconditionally. I worried she might become one of those fanatical followers, but part of me felt a strange sense of anticipation.

I cleared my throat to quiet them down.

“Ahem. As I’ve said before, I heard from instructors at the User Academy—not from the Golden Lion Clan—that going on or joining this expedition is foolish. At least, that’s my opinion. I’m not certain, but I trust their words more.”

The group looked somewhat relieved, though their agitation hadn’t fully subsided. Honestly, I was a bit frustrated. If I could just tell them how disastrously the expedition fails and how the Golden Lion Clan falls apart and gets ridiculed afterward, I would. But I held back a sigh, knowing I needed valid reasons to convince them. At the very least, I needed to lay down some cover.

“Listen carefully. This is just my opinion, so don’t take it too seriously. The Golden Lion Clan thinks the North Continent is stable enough to rush into preparing this expedition. But to me, it doesn’t seem right.”

“Oppa, does stabilization have to happen before an expedition is possible? Even if it’s a bit risky, a successful expedition would be a huge win, right?” Yu-jeong asked.

“That’s true. The problem is, the stakes of that gamble are the users’ lives.”

The mention of “lives” made Yu-jeong fall silent. The atmosphere grew noticeably heavier than before.

“I read the records of when Barbara was conquered. The first thing I felt was how brutal it was. If Barbara was that tough, do you think Atlanta, a step above, will be any easier? I doubt it. To succeed in the Steel Mountains expedition, they need to bring their continent to full saturation, muster their maximum forces, secure a decent number of new users, and then plan the expedition. The North Continent is still in the process of reaching saturation—it’s not there yet. Just look at Mul, where we are now. It’s clear the expedition is premature. I’m sure there are others who think the same. The Golden Lion Clan still hasn’t learned its lesson from the previous Lord’s mistakes… Tsk.”

“Previous Lord?” An-hyeon asked.

I realized I’d slipped up. Luckily, I’d mentioned reading records earlier, so I could cover it up. Still, I made a mental note to be more careful with my words. Composing myself, I looked at An-hyeon calmly and nodded.

“They say he was the one who made the greatest contribution to conquering Barbara. Haven’t you heard about him at the User Academy? It’s impressive. With just a standard Swordsman class, he founded the Golden Lion Clan, now considered the top clan, and achieved so much.”

Seeing them nod, I let out a sigh of relief.

“They say before Barbara was conquered, the Hall Plane was based in the western cities of Halo, Beth, and Dorothy. After stabilizing the eastern cities, they tackled Barbara, but he died from wounds he couldn’t recover from.”

“If that person were still alive, they might’ve already reached Atlanta,” An-hyeon said.

Bullshit. I barely stopped myself from saying it out loud. In reality, Atlanta isn’t reached until after the Golden Lion Clan’s dissolution and several civil wars. I acknowledged his role in pioneering Barbara, but there was no guarantee he could’ve conquered the Steel Mountains even if he’d lived.

In the Hall Plane, surviving required not just individual strength but also extensive knowledge across various domains. Though we’d taken a long break, I considered it a valuable time for the group. I brushed off my pants and stood up.

“Anyway, that’s the gist of it, so just keep it in mind. There’s no point or qualification for us to join the expedition, so forget about it. Let’s focus on what we can do now.”

This time, An-hyeon looked at Yu-jeong with a smug expression. Yu-jeong nodded sulkily and stood up after me. It was almost time to use my Third Eye. If my guess was right, we’d likely find the Alchemist’s Dungeon within a day or two.
