# Memorize - Chapter 20 (20/1068)

# For a Moment, We Part

Thanks a bunch for this. My throat was parched, and here you are treating me to a beer—don’t know what to do with myself! What’s your name… huh? Kim Su-hyeon? No way, the one from the small city of Mul? I’ve heard of you! The tale from the Cave of Screams is pretty famous… hehe. Getting treated to a beer by a celebrity like you, I can’t just sit here quietly. Alright, how about I tell you a story? Wanna hear it?

What? No need? Hold on a sec. Just listen for a bit, even if it’s short. I bet it’ll pique your interest. They say even the Soul Commander, who’s been tearing it up in the big city, got their start in the Rite of Passage. Yeah, that Soul Commander. Everyone in the Hall Plane has gone through the Rite of Passage, right? Come on, take a seat. The angels have messed with a lot of things, and one of their favorite playgrounds is the Rite of Passage.

There’s quite a bit of behind-the-scenes stuff going on there. Think about it—everyone’s just trying to survive. Who in their right mind would wander around a monster-infested place for seven days straight? But there were some crazy folks who did just that. For seven whole days, they scoured every inch of the map like maniacs. Naturally, that increased their chances of running into the boss monster of the Rite of Passage. What’s that? You never ran into it? Guess you played it pretty straight, Kim Su-hyeon. What I mean is… hold up, could you grab me another beer? Hehe… thanks!

Think back. You remember the yellow roof and the blue roof, right? Yeah, yellow’s the Rest Room, blue’s the Save Point. The first thing you see when you step inside is the warning sign, yeah? Rest Room—you can’t stay more than a day. Save Point—no more than two days. Stay any longer, and a boss monster shows up, 100% guaranteed. Ugh, still gives me chills. That thing looked like an alien, chomping down on people like they were a tasty snack…

Yeah, I’ve run into it. What’d I do? Ran like hell, that’s what. Funny thing is, besides the Starting Point, Rest Room, and Save Point, there’s another place. Never heard of it? Figures. Wanna know where?

If you head through the forest at the edge of the map and keep going, you’ll hit a big road. I still remember it—bumpy as all get-out. You can’t go down, though; it’s crawling with Wraiths. So, you head up, and eventually, you hit a city. But honestly, who’s gonna go that far? Nobody wants to set foot in that forest to begin with. And even if you make it to the city, hardly anyone comes out alive. That place is called the Trap Point. Exactly what it sounds like—a trap.

The Trap Point city has all the modern conveniences, plenty of food, everything. It’s like a nostalgia trip back to Earth, tugging at your heartstrings so bad you don’t want to leave. The warning sign? It’s there, but it’s different from the ones at the other points. It’s so simple you barely notice it. Anyway, that city plays with your head, makes you never want to leave. Most Users who find it end up staying. They think, “I can ride out the seven days here, no problem.” The moment you settle in, though, it’s over.

After two days pass, on the third day… you can guess what happens, right? Heh. What’s that? How do I know all this? Haha… let’s just say I’ll have another drink.

As the afternoon rolled in, I could see the sky growing darker. It was a bit too early to call it evening, but the forest felt gloomier than usual. The clouds were casting a dark hue, and I couldn’t shake the thought that rain might pour down any moment.

Walking along the bumpy road, I grew impatient, hoping a village would come into view soon. It seemed I needed to pick up the pace. I channeled a bit of mana into my legs, and my speed increased noticeably. Moving quickly, I recalled the moment I’d used my Third Eye to glimpse the past.

It was brief—barely a second—but what I saw gave me a rough idea of what had happened to my party. The scene played out like this: An-hyeon, abandoning his longsword and shield, was running with An-sol on his back, his face etched with urgency. Behind him, Lee Yu-jeong wore an ambiguous expression—part worry, part anger—as she chased after him. Only Kim Han-byeol remained calm, picking up An-hyeon’s discarded sword and shield and following at the rear.

Clearly, some kind of attack or threat had hit the group, and something had happened to An-sol in the chaos. So, I’d decided to head in the direction they’d fled. The road showed signs of human use, so I figured it would lead to a village eventually. That’s where I’d likely reunite with An-hyeon and the others.

What could have attacked them? What made them run with such desperate expressions? Curiosity gnawed at me, one question leading to another. But puzzling over it now wouldn’t yield answers. I decided to hear their story later and quickened my steps again.

As I walked, a cold droplet splashed onto my cheek. I paused and looked up to see raindrops falling toward my face.

Drip. Drip. Drip. Drip.

Wiping the water from my cheek reflexively, I hoped the village would appear before a downpour hit. Luckily, my prayers seemed answered as I spotted a cluster of buildings in the distance, visible even with my enhanced eyesight.

The party had to be in that village. But since monsters often lurked in villages too, I worried whether they’d made it inside safely. Maybe I should’ve dealt with things earlier instead of dragging it out.

The raindrops dotting the ground were multiplying, turning the path into a muddy mess—something I’d rather avoid. Slowing my pace to a steady walk, I closed the distance to the village while instinctively spreading my mana detection. As I scanned the area, something felt off, and I stopped dead in my tracks.

“What… what’s this?”

I stammered without meaning to. Composing myself, I probed more carefully, but the result was the same. Startled, I surged mana through my body and rushed into the village. Upon reaching the entrance, I gaped at the sight of modern buildings.

“The Rite of Passage has buildings like you’d see on Earth? And a ton of them?”

As expected, I sensed the presence of my four companions inside the village—thankfully, they were all together. But two things threw me into confusion. First, I couldn’t detect a single monster in the area. Second, the city before me was filled with modern buildings.

Hall Plane cities don’t have modern architecture. They resemble medieval structures, something I had to adjust to during my first run through the Rite of Passage. Yet here, right in front of me, stood buildings straight out of Earth.

My mind reeled at this unprecedented situation, but I forced myself to calm down and assess things rationally. The first challenge for humans entering the Hall Plane is adapting to its lifestyle. Compared to Earth’s advanced technology, life in the Hall Plane isn’t exactly convenient. To ease that transition, the Rite of Passage includes buildings styled like those in the Hall Plane to help Users adjust. But this? I’d never heard of or seen anything like it.

Unless the angels had collectively lost their minds, they wouldn’t have placed these buildings here without a purpose. As I rubbed my eyes and confirmed the city’s appearance didn’t change, it hit me that the angels must have an agenda. Then, a memory surfaced—a story I’d heard from a swordsman in a tavern long ago.

“The Trap Point city has all the modern conveniences, plenty of food, everything. It’s like a nostalgia trip back to Earth, tugging at your heartstrings so bad you don’t want to leave.”

The Trap Point. Suddenly, the city before me made sense. But to explain the Trap Point, I had to consider the boss monster first. Simply put, you can’t kill a boss monster in the Hall Plane. Plenty of people have seen them, and they all say the same thing: they’re impossible to defeat. You have to run.

Boss monsters appear under specific conditions—stay in a Rest Room for more than a day or a Save Point for more than two days, and they show up without fail. It’s the angels’ way of warning you not to get comfortable and to keep moving.

A chill ran down my spine. Now I understood why the city felt so empty and quiet when I first saw it. And why, despite the high stats of my party—except for An-sol—no one had made it to the Hall Plane in my vision. If this city was a Trap Point, it explained everything. No matter how strong they were, they couldn’t face a boss monster.

I let out a deep sigh and fully entered the city. The sight of these buildings after ten years stirred some nostalgia, but my priority was finding my party.

As I stepped inside, the gray buildings greeted me, their dim glow casting an unwelcoming vibe. The heavy scent of death lingered, a feeling only someone with seasoned experience could pick up. How many people had died in this place?
