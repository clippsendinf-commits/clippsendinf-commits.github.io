# Memorize - Chapter 101: Su-hyeon’s Madness

Before anything else, I casually raised my left hand and cast an Anti-Magic spell. The demon had boasted that he was only using seventy percent of his power, but these creatures were never to be trusted.  
A white light burst from my ring, colliding with the dark blue flames rushing toward me. The flames flickered briefly before vanishing entirely. However, Belphegor’s dark fire merely paused for a moment before surging toward me with renewed ferocity.  
As I activated the Anti-Magic spell, the demon initially raised an intrigued eyebrow, but upon seeing the result, he let out a mocking sneer.  
“Foolish human. Did you think your pathetic magic could extinguish the flames of a great demon? These are the eternal, inextinguishable flames reserved for those of ducal rank or higher…”  
“Shut your trap, you lunatic.”  
“Dare you—!”  
I didn’t hear the rest of his words. Or rather, I deliberately tuned them out because I couldn’t stand listening to him any longer. Watching the dark flames draw closer, I gripped my sword, aimed it directly ahead, and closed my eyes.  
*Rise, Hwa-jeong. Awaken and show this pathetic creature what true, eternal fire looks like.*  
I felt the ancient priestess’s stigma, etched into my heart, pulse fiercely in response to my inner voice. Alongside it, Hwa-jeong—the pure embodiment of fire—answered my call. Channeling its power, I swung my sword in a perfect horizontal arc. To others, it might look like a simple horizontal slash, but this strike was a flawless, precise cut, honed to the pinnacle of swordsmanship, free of even the slightest error or excess.  
As I spun my sword once, I felt something catch faintly at its tip, followed by a sound like fireworks exploding, reverberating through the air. The dark flames Belphegor had unleashed split cleanly in half, as if they were nothing. They froze midair, burning away into nothingness.  
I let my sword hang loosely downward. Gasps echoed from my party, who had been preparing defensive spells, and from Belphegor, who had been smugly posturing. With that single exchange, I could roughly gauge the demon’s strength.  
“Looks like seventy percent was generous. Fifty percent? No… maybe sixty?”  
At my taunt, the demon’s face twisted for the first time. But he quickly composed himself and spoke in a grave tone.  
“You! How did you do that…?”  
“Exactly as you saw.”  
“Impossible! How could you extinguish the flames of a supreme demon, a power granted only to the highest among us!”  
“You saw it with your own eyes and still spout nonsense. Guess all your so-called supreme demons have eyes as useless as yours. Thanks for the info.”  
“Grr…!”  
Belphegor bristled with anger and summoned another massive dark flame. As a spherical orb began to form above his right hand, I, too, drew up a clear, crimson aura.  
“I’ll make sure that insolent mouth of yours never speaks again.”  
Gritting his teeth, Belphegor glared at me. I responded with a serious expression.  
“Didn’t you already see that your precious demon flames don’t work on me? Why don’t you try something else to entertain me?”  
“Silence!”  
With a roar, he swung his arm forcefully. A flame the size of ten soccer balls hurtled toward me. In the past, I might have charged head-on to meet it, but there was no need for that now. I took a deep breath and focused on the two weapons at my disposal.  
The authority of the Sword Specialist, capable of cutting through anything.  
The authority of Hwa-jeong, capable of burning anything to ash.  
The moment they aligned perfectly, I swung my sword without hesitation.  
*Boom! Whoosh…!*  
“No… impossible…”  
Belphegor stared, as if entranced, at the scene unfolding before him. The flames he had poured his full strength into were sliced cleanly in half, and from the severed edges, a single bright flame erupted, consuming them entirely.  
Finally, the expression I’d been waiting for appeared on his face. *This is fun. I want to crush him. Tear him apart. Kill him.* I tried to regain my composure, but the more I did, the more my excitement surged uncontrollably. Steadying my now-ragged breathing, I spoke slowly.  
“Got anything else to show me?”  
“What… what do you mean?”  
“Summon your Magic Sword Skrep. Or maybe the Colossus of Destruction… or are you preparing to flee with your Dark Assimilation?”  
As I listed his signature techniques, Belphegor’s face grew even more bewildered, and he stammered.  
“H-How! Who are you?!”  
“Whoa, calm down. Is this how your beloved Lilith taught you to act in moments like this?”  
Mentioning Lilith made his face explode with rage. The Demon World operates on the law of the strong. Demons may have fierce pride, but once they submit, they pledge unwavering loyalty—to other demons, that is.  
At the mention of Lilith, Belphegor’s expression twisted again.  
“Watch your mouth, you wretch. You’re not worthy to speak her name.”  
“Why not? Lilith? The Demon World’s infamous harlot? Everyone knows about her defeat and humiliation at Astaroth’s hands. What, you didn’t know?”  
This was something I’d learned by chance during my first cycle. It had happened long before I entered the Hall Plane, but it was still a well-known story. And nothing provoked Lilith’s fiercely loyal demons more than this.  
As expected, my mockery pushed Belphegor over the edge, and he erupted with fury.  
“Raaaargh!”  
He let out a massive roar, raising both hands skyward. The space around him warped, and an ominous aura enveloped the area. My party, who had been standing by silently, glanced around with uneasy expressions.  
I turned to them and spoke.  
“An-hyeon, Yu-jeong, stay where you are. Mages and priests, use every defensive spell you know to protect the party.”  
“Kim Su-hyeon! What are you talking about?!”  
Vivian shouted at me. The rest of the party wore similar expressions, but my murderous aura silenced them. Only someone like Vivian could withstand it enough to speak up.  
“No arguments. I don’t care about the others, but this one’s mine. Stay back.”  
As I spoke, Belphegor’s presence grew even more intense. A quick glance showed his hair standing on end, as if charged with electricity. His muttering suggested he was preparing a massive spell—likely the Colossus of Destruction. *What an idiot, actually using it just because I mentioned it.*  
“Kim Su-hyeon! Are you joking? Even if he’s not at full strength, he’s still a high-ranking—”  
Vivian’s incessant chatter grated on me, and I clenched my teeth. I had no patience to coddle anyone right now.  
“Shut up and stay back!”  
“W-What…”  
At my shout, Vivian recoiled with a wounded expression, taking a step or two back. But I had no time to comfort her now.  
I raised my sword and assumed a stance. The technique I was about to use was a type of ability, classified as a user skill. Unlike in the past, my immense magical power would amplify its potency. I drew up a massive surge of mana.  
The Colossus of Destruction was a large-scale spell. Alone, I might have been fine, but my party would be obliterated in an instant, pierced by a meteor shower. I had no choice but to counter with a technique capable of matching it—one I couldn’t use in my first cycle due to insufficient magical power but could now wield.  
“A technique developed to face *her*… I didn’t expect to use it this soon,” I muttered bitterly, then stomped the ground once.  
*  
I couldn’t accept it. A great demon like me, feeling fear from a mere human? Impossible. Yet, that impossible fear was unfolding before me now.  
Driven by that fear, I had no choice but to unleash my trump card. Preparing such a massive spell in my weakened state was reckless, but its effectiveness was undeniable.  
I didn’t know how this human could extinguish demon flames, but it was likely limited to one or two instances. Against hundreds of small meteors infused with dark flames, no human could survive—not even a speck of ash would remain. It was a shame I couldn’t take the female humans, but it paled in comparison to the insult Lilith had suffered.  
My heart strained under the burden, but I endured. The spell was complete. All that remained was to unleash it on the insolent human below. As I lowered my head to confirm his position, a chill ran through me.  
“Gasp.”  
An unfamiliar sensation gripped my entire body. I nearly canceled the spell I’d painstakingly summoned. For the first time in ages, I felt the sting of death, the sensation of annihilation. My honed instincts screamed warnings: *You’ll die. Flee.*  
“Die… me?”  
*Me, killed by a human?*  
I let out a fierce roar, a primal struggle to shake off the fear consuming me. The act gave me a sliver of courage, and I swung both hands toward the human with all my might. A small-scale meteor shower infused with demon flames—its name was…  
“Haaaaaa! Colossus of Destruction!”  
No other thoughts remained. My mind was consumed with annihilating the human before me and restoring my dignity as quickly as possible. Yet, deep down, I couldn’t deny that this desperation stemmed from a primal instinct to survive.  
At that moment, I saw the human stomp the ground once. It was a simple motion, but the ground rippled like water around him. The disturbance was fleeting, and the earth stilled again. I swallowed hard. *What was that? What is he doing?*  
Then, the sound of the ceiling collapsing echoed, and I sensed the presence of the meteors I’d summoned. A triumphant smile spread across my face. *Fool. Giving me time was your downfall.* Glancing up, I saw the meteors of the Colossus of Destruction pouring through the broken ceiling. Relief washed over me. The penalties for using such a reckless spell in my weakened state, the consequences of damaging the building with my power—none of it mattered. All I could think was that I would survive.  
Then it happened.  
The human, who had been still, suddenly raised his sword and thrust it into the air. A clear, crimson flame enveloped the blade. Seeing that flame, unease gripped me again. Something told me that touching it would mean the end. A strange humming vibration filled the air.  
*Ku-ku-ku-ku…*  
An odd energy surged from the ground. When that energy merged with the crimson flames, I could only stare in shock.  
The sword blazed crimson, and then it multiplied. Literally, Flame Swords. One, two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two… the swords grew in number, soon filling the space around him so densely they were impossible to count.  
“Ha…”  
A hollow laugh escaped me. I met the human’s gaze. The moment I saw his smile, goosebumps covered my body. *Why? Why does he hate me so much?* The flow of mana sustaining the Colossus of Destruction nearly faltered, but I barely held it together.  
From the start, I didn’t like him. The moment he saw me, he radiated endless hostility. His tone suggested he knew something about me. Fueled by defiance, I poured even more mana into the spell.  
The human’s face was eerily calm, as if mocking my ability to defeat him. Standing with an air of arrogance, he crossed his arms and let out a faint smile. In that stance, he slowly raised his right hand and snapped his fingers.  
The sharp sound of his fingers echoed in my ears, and the swords surrounding him shot toward me in unison. Instinctively, I wanted to dodge, but seeing the meteors streaking past me, I steeled myself.  
Countless meteors hurtled toward him.  
Countless Flame Swords raced toward me.  
Like two massive storms colliding, I gritted my teeth at the sight.
