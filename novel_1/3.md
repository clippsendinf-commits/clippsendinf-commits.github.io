# Memorize - Episode 3 (3/1068): Seraph, Flustered

I turned back time by ten years. Seraph, who had been by my side throughout those ten years, was gone.

“So, what happens now…?”

The altar before me stood empty, but soon an angel would be summoned atop it. It could be a new angel, or perhaps Seraph would appear again. If it were the former, it wouldn’t matter much, but if it were the latter, what then? I could only guess that she might emerge without any memory of our time together, yet a spark of curiosity flickered within me.

After waiting about three minutes, I sensed a reaction. The space above the altar began to ripple like waves. In my first cycle, I would have been unconscious by now. Having never witnessed the summoning of an angel before, I observed the altar with keen interest.

Like ripples spreading across a pond, concentric waves pulsed outward, and from their center, a pure white light began to leak through. The light shimmered briefly before bursting like fireworks, forming a radiant figure. I watched every detail of the new angel’s creation unfold.

Finally, the summoning was complete, and a single angel appeared on the altar. Her eyes were still closed, but her presence felt achingly familiar. Shimmering wings exuded holiness. An air of untouchable elegance and radiant brilliance enveloped her. The angel who emerged was the spitting image of Seraph, perfect in every way.

As if sensing my gaze, Seraph’s eyes slowly opened. In that fleeting moment, a glint of curiosity passed through her jade-green pupils as they met mine.

Beautiful. Noble.

Like angels from novels or manga, Seraph radiated an indescribable tranquility and sacred aura, overflowing with captivating charm. Her silvery-white hair gleamed as if coated in moonlight, flowing with the luster of silk. Her skin was as fair as fresh snow, flawless and smooth. Her faintly double-lidded eyes sparkled with jade-like brilliance, and glimpses of her delicate frame only enhanced her allure.

Yet, despite her breathtaking appearance, not a trace of desire stirred within me. She was a being from another plane, and the emotions we felt toward each other were fundamentally different.

Perhaps surprised to see me awake, I felt Seraph’s gaze linger. Her calm eyes scanned me thoroughly, as if assessing every detail. Meeting her familiar stare, I finally felt certain.

*Seraph. It’s you from ten years ago.*

At that moment, her delicate lips parted.

“Pleased to meet you.”

“Yeah.”

“Welcome to the Summoning Room. You are from Earth, the Republic of Korea. Age: 23. Name: Kim Su-hyeon. Your identity has been verified. Henceforth, you will be referred to as User Kim Su-hyeon for convenience. I am Seraph, your guide from this point forward.”

“Yeah.”

“User Kim Su-hyeon, you will be provided with basic knowledge in this Summoning Room before being transported to a place called the Rite of Passage. There, you must prove your qualifications to become a true User.”

“Yeah.”

Seraph, who had been speaking rapidly, fell silent. She tilted her head with a look that seemed to say, *This isn’t right.* Seeing her like that sparked a small, fresh emotion in me. But first, I had to claim what was mine.

“I have a question…”

“If it’s about where you are or why you’re here, I advise against asking. Only two hours remain before you enter the Rite of Passage. I understand this situation may be confusing, but if you wish to survive and return—”

Seraph, as if seizing the moment, launched into another rapid-fire explanation. Even now, somewhat accustomed to her, I remembered how intimidating she had been at first. Her expressionless face and serene tone had made her seem almost ghostly.

Recalling that moment brought a wry smile to my lips. After letting out a soft chuckle, I replied calmly, “Oh, sure.”

“I recommend using the remaining time to adjust to your situation as much as possible—”

“Got it, got it.”

Despite my easy agreement, Seraph’s brow furrowed slightly. Her hand floated slowly through the air, and she blinked a few times, muttering in a hesitant tone.

“Not mentally unstable… and remarkably calm. Peculiar.”

“Who’re you calling unstable? Anyway, doesn’t matter. Isn’t it easier for you if I just go along with what you say, Seraph?”

“That is true, but—”

“Then we’re good. Why all the grumbling?”

“I am not grumbling. Very well. User Kim Su-hyeon’s attitude is highly commendable. If you maintain this approach, your survival rate will increase significantly. Now, let us—”

This time, I raised my hand outright. Seraph, catching my gesture, stopped speaking again.

“I said I had a question.”

“Very well. As long as it does not pertain to the matters I mentioned earlier, I will permit your question.”

“It’s not that. Don’t you have something for me?”

“Something for you? I do not understand the precise meaning of your question. Please provide further clarification.”

“Hmm… Oh, I heard it’s called Tanay?”

The moment I said “Tanay,” Seraph visibly flinched. *Just as I thought.* Her reaction was amusing, but a twinge of worry crept in—would I actually get it? I couldn’t afford to miss out on my privileges. Deciding to press forward, even if it meant strong-arming her, I spoke in a coaxing tone.

“Tanay, definitely Tanay. It’s nice to get started, but shouldn’t I get what’s owed to me first…?”

Seraph quickly regained her composure, but only on the surface. To my eyes, it was clear she was struggling to hide her agitation. Her usually slow-flapping wings were now fluttering frantically, betraying her fluster.

“Please wait a moment.”

Seraph closed her eyes. Her fingers tapped the air at a furious pace, and her lips moved incessantly. She was likely verifying Tanay and communicating with the other angels.

Time passed, enough to sip a cup of tea. Seraph’s face went through a myriad of expressions, and I watched in silence, entertained. It wasn’t a sight you saw every day, so the wait didn’t feel tedious.

Finally, Seraph opened her eyes, still wearing a look of disbelief.

“I wish to speak with User Kim Su-hyeon.”

“Nah, I’m good.”

“It will only take a moment.”

“If it’s about where I am or why I’m here, I advise against asking. Only two hours remain before the Rite of Passage. I understand this situation may be confusing, but… what else did you say?”

Repeating her earlier words verbatim, I watched as Seraph promptly shut her mouth.

“Anyway, like you said, there’s not much time left before the Rite of Passage. So, give what you owe, and let’s call it even. Sounds reasonable, right?”

I deliberately emphasized “reasonable,” and Seraph bit her lip. *Yeah, you’re frustrated, aren’t you?* She probably never imagined being outtalked by a human.

Truth be told, I’d always wanted to experience a moment like this. When I first arrived here, Seraph had been cold, almost as if she were observing a lab rat. She ignored my pleas to be sent back and, when I caused a commotion, promptly subdued me. Those memories made this moment oddly satisfying.

A smug smile crept onto my face. Seraph stared at me for a moment before snapping her fingers lightly.

*Snap!*

The sound of flesh meeting flesh rang out, and the flow of time around us slowed slightly. Though my body had been reset, my ten years of experience let me sense it.

Seraph spoke again.

“User Kim Su-hyeon’s request is reasonable. Therefore, I will compensate for the lost time. The flow of time in the Summoning Room has been slowed. Are you satisfied?”

“Yeah.”

Seraph studied me carefully for a moment before speaking calmly.

“I, too, have questions about User Kim Su-hyeon. But if you’re unwilling, I won’t press.”

“Oh, really? I was just about to tell you.”

Teasingly, I shrugged, and Seraph’s eyes gleamed.

“Is that so? Indeed, my fellow guides and I are quite perplexed. If you’re willing, I’d like to hear the full story.”

“Nah, I’m good.”

Realizing I’d been toying with her, Seraph’s cheeks flushed red. I had to resist the urge to clap and laugh. She glared at me with a pout before composing herself and speaking calmly.

“Excessive behavior may warrant appropriate measures, but the first principle of guides is to do no harm to Users. That said, I ask that you refrain from such teasing in the future.”

“You’re beings of a higher plane, right? Just forgive me with your boundless generosity.”

“…I have verified Tanay. It is a binding oath, already fulfilled, that we cannot refuse. After thorough review, the privileges assigned to User Kim Su-hyeon are indisputably yours.”

“Hm. You accepted that pretty quickly. Kinda boring.”

“For us, Tanay holds that kind of weight. While we can review it, we cannot exert any influence over it. Thus, the privileges granted to User Kim Su-hyeon cannot be revoked. You may rest assured.”

“But starting with this kind of power at year zero? That’s bound to make me an exception, right? Like, upsetting the balance or something…”

“It will not affect the balance.”

Seraph answered without hesitation, her expression stern.

“I’ve reviewed the details of your privileges. They are indeed exceptional. However, arrogance is unwise. Even with all your privileges, there are beings whose abilities surpass them.”

True to form, Seraph was repeating the same old warnings. Still, her saying “there are beings” was a far cry from the “countless” she’d mentioned before. I nodded in acknowledgment.

“Fair enough. No need to focus only on Users. There could be other beings in the Hall Plane.”

“Correct.”

The moment I said “Hall Plane,” Seraph’s eyes flickered briefly.

“Setting all of User Kim Su-hyeon’s privileges will take considerable time. There are 1 hour, 47 minutes, and 26 seconds remaining. To align with the Rite of Passage, we’re cutting it close. I suspect you already know the inner workings of the Hall Plane…”

“Ok. Skip it. That’s what I wanted anyway.”

“While I’ve artificially slowed time, this is only for the compensated duration. Some preparation is required before we proceed. Please wait a moment.”

As Seraph prepared, my thoughts turned to the Rite of Passage.

Simply put, the Rite of Passage is a trial to prove one’s qualifications as a User. It’s where people like me, abducted without explanation, are gathered. The conditions for passing are straightforward: survive for seven days or reach the Warp Gate within that time. In essence, survival is the key requirement.

Those who succeed are summoned back to the Summoning Room, assigned a Class based on their potential, and finally enter the real space of the Hall Plane. It’s an unfair and chilling test—fail to meet the survival condition, and you’re deemed “dead.”

“User Kim Su-hyeon, all preparations are complete.”

Lost in thought, I was pulled back by Seraph’s signal that she was ready.

“The details of your privileges—”

“I know them. They’re all in my head, so let’s get started.”

“Understood. There’s no need to convey additional information. Which privilege would you like to receive first?”

“Hm…”

I recalled the first ability.

*1. User Kim Su-hyeon will be granted privileges related to their original stat information. First, you may “load” the User information achieved in the first cycle. Second, four of the six base stats will be randomly selected and enhanced. The degree of enhancement will also be random.*

Privileges couldn’t be set arbitrarily—Seraph’s order had a purpose. The first one was the logical choice, as stats were the foundation of everything. Inheriting my previous stats would naturally steer me toward a swordsman path, but I needed to confirm the enhancement range.

Without hesitation, I spoke.

“Load and the stat enhancement privilege first.”

“Yes. Loading information registered under User Kim Su-hyeon. 27%, 56%, 87%, 100%. Complete. Load successful.”

As Seraph finished, a surge of vitality coursed through me. The slowed flow of time became even more tangible. Even at 23, fresh from military service, my body couldn’t compare to that of a Sword Master.

*Whoosh!*

I thrust my right arm forward, and a sharp gust followed. Satisfied, I checked my User information.

The stats had been inherited. Everything else, however, was reset. I felt a pang for my lost titles and achievements but nodded, accepting it.

“User information load confirmed. Now for the stat enhancement privilege?”

“Yes, of course. Just to clarify, four of the six stats will be randomly enhanced. Both the stats and the degree of enhancement are random but will align with your potential and growth. Please keep this in mind.”

“I know.”

In simple terms, higher stats would see smaller increases, while lower ones would gain more. This was a universal rule, with slight variations based on individual potential. Barring fortuitous encounters, elixirs, or achievement rewards, stat growth through training alone had its limits.

Strength, Endurance, Magic Power—I silently prayed for these to be enhanced.

Magic Power was my top priority, followed by Endurance and Strength. Durability and Agility were equal in my mind, with Luck trailing last. Of course, if one stat was high but the others were abysmally low, that would be problematic. Still, assuming decent support from other stats, Magic Power was the most efficient.

“I’ll apply it now.”

*Please, not Luck. Strength, Endurance, Magic Power—or at least Endurance and Magic Power…!*

Whether my desperate wish reached her, I couldn’t tell, but the privilege was applied. The moment Seraph waved her hand, four messages appeared in the air before me.
