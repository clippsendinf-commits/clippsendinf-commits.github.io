# Memorize - Episode 140 (140/1068): The End of Training

For three days of marching, we didn’t engage in a single battle with monsters. We encountered a few groups of them, but with some distance between us and our rapid pace, we often just passed them by. 

What I was teaching the kids was rapid marching. The point of rapid marching is to avoid monsters as much as possible or simply bypass them, prioritizing reaching the target destination as quickly as possible. 

The kids struggled immensely on the first and second days, but by the third, they showed relatively stable progress. Instead of blindly following along, they had begun to grasp how to regulate their breathing, pace, and use of mana on their own.

After crossing three mountain peaks and setting foot on flat ground again, the kids were overjoyed. But I turned our course toward another peak visible ahead. (As an aside, I could’ve sworn I heard silent screams from behind.)

Until now, rapid marching and a bit of luck had kept us from encountering monsters. (The group heavily suspected An-sol’s involvement in this, and she responded by hanging her head.) However, mountains often harbor monster settlements, and passing through meant we’d inevitably cross their paths. If those monsters saw us as <intruders>, combat was unavoidable. Just like now.

“Oppa, what are those ugly monkeys? I’ve never seen them before,” Yu-jeong asked.

“Aren’t they Mangi?” An-hyeon chimed in.

I shook my head at their blank expressions.

Before us stood monkeys boasting fluffy fur, about twenty in number. They were slightly over two meters tall, with sturdy, muscular builds. Compared to Mangi, which could be likened to scruffy monkeys, these looked almost refined.

They were fairly strong and clever, but still just monkeys. I slowly drew my sword and answered, “Furry Monkeys. Think of them as a higher species than Mangi. Their combat style is similar, but they’re superior in every way, so don’t let your guard down. We’ll stick to the formation I explained before we set out. Yu-jeong, you’re on free role.”

“Yay! Love you, Oppa!” 

*Srung, srung-srung.*

At the signal to prepare, I heard the clatter of weapons being readied behind me. This was the kids’ first real chance to show their skills in combat. As I listened to their eager spell chants, I raised one finger toward the monkeys and mimed slicing it with my sword, adding a deliberate smirk.

Furry Monkeys had a peculiar trait: their population was overwhelmingly female. Their reproduction rate wasn’t great, so males were heavily protected within their settlements, rarely leaving. The males were little more than breeding machines. My taunt—mimicking the act of severing a male’s organ—was bound to provoke the females. Sure enough, their eyes blazed red as they screeched and began breathing heavily. I casually flicked my sword, intending to take it easy and observe the kids’ performance rather than jumping in myself.

“*Kik-kik!*”

With ear-splitting shrieks, several Furry Monkeys leaped into the air, aiming for a diving Leaf Attack. But as they soared, they suddenly stuck out their tongues and plummeted to the ground, one after another.

Glancing back, I saw Go Yeon-ju twirling her dagger with a relaxed air. No sound, no warning. I gave a wry smile at her nonchalance and turned back to the front. The monkeys seemed startled, but their eyes burned even fiercer. They were enraged by their kin’s deaths, but frankly, it wasn’t intimidating. The kids seemed to feel the same.

*Thud. Thud. Thud.*

Crimson blood spilled from the fallen monkeys, staining the ground. That was the signal for battle to begin.

“*Ki-ki-ki! Ki-ki-ki-ki!*”

The Furry Monkeys charged with frenzied cries. In response, our mage users raised their chanting voices even louder. Just then, Yu-jeong leaped forward.

As the monkeys rushed with raised arms, Yu-jeong slipped through a precise gap in their ranks with graceful ease. In her left hand gleamed a new katana she’d recently acquired. As one monkey hesitated while passing her, she swiftly darted behind it, leaping onto its back.

“*Kiik?*”

Feeling something cling to its back, the monkey shook its head wildly. But Yu-jeong had already secured her position. Her right hand gripped the monkey’s head tightly while her left pressed the katana to its throat. The monkey thrashed, but Yu-jeong’s legs had locked around its torso and thighs, immobilizing it. With a cruel smile, she slid the katana across its neck.

“*Kieee!*”

A pitiful scream accompanied a fountain of blood spurting from the monkey’s throat. The other monkeys, snapping out of their shock, turned and charged at Yu-jeong with alarming speed. She lowered her left hand, perhaps because the katana was stuck, and licked her lips before releasing her grip. But in that moment, she was vulnerable to attacks from all sides. Yet her eyes weren’t panicked—they were scanning for an opportunity.

The source of her confidence soon became clear. A long arm emerged from her shadow, yanked the katana from the fallen monkey’s neck, and swung it in a wide arc. Quick-witted monkeys dodged, but one or two took deep gashes from the surprise attack. The shadowy hand returned the katana to Yu-jeong and melted back into her shadow, its task complete.

“Looks like the little one’s putting in some work today, huh?” Go Yeon-ju’s amused laugh rang out.

In response, Yu-jeong drew the Magic Sword Skrep with her right hand. Facing the charging monkeys, she assumed a stance, and I watched with interest, eager to see her dual-wielding in action.

Her body slightly crouched, she held the katana low and Skrep high. With a provocative moan, she swayed her blades. Rather than staying still, she moved her feet, weaving through the fray. As a monkey lunged, she sidestepped, and a flash of her blade drew a long streak of blood from its neck.

After cleanly dispatching one, she began swinging her dagger like a windmill. She didn’t take them down in one hit like before, but her wide swings were meant to damage multiple foes at once. She succeeded in making two monkeys cry out, but one she hadn’t noticed struck like lightning from her blind spot.

*Pow!* A powerful fist slammed into her back, sending her flying.

“Damn it!” 

Yu-jeong tumbled toward us, spitting a low curse before springing back up. An-sol began chanting a healing spell, but Yu-jeong waved her off, signaling she was fine. With gear like hers, a hit like that was manageable.

Returning to our ranks, she flashed a slight smile, her gaze locking onto mine. I chuckled at her silent protest and looked away. 

Yu-jeong had made her point. She’d charged into the fray, blunted their initial rush, killed or injured several monkeys, and—most importantly—bought time for the mages to prepare their spells while keeping the frontline tanks at a safe distance.

As expected, the moment she returned, Shin Sang-yong and Ha-yeon’s voices rang out.

“Gust of Wind!”

“Land of Aqua!”

A fierce wind blew toward the monkeys, and Ha-yeon wove a water spell into it. Drenched by the water-laden gust, the monkeys were prime targets as Ha-yeon chanted her next spell.

“Cone of Ice!”

*Crack! Crack!*

Long, icy spikes erupted from the water clinging to the monkeys, piercing their bodies. As they knelt, screaming in agony, Yu-jeong tapped An-hyeon’s shoulder.

“Why don’t you go clean up, Mr. Ki-Gong Spearmaster, Rare Class An-hyeon?”

I reflexively glanced at An-hyeon. Surprisingly, he looked calm. Though a spark of competitive spirit flickered in his eyes, he responded to her taunt in a steady voice.

“I’m the sub-tank. I can’t leave my position yet.”

“Hmph. Boring.”

Yu-jeong glanced at me before turning back to the front. The ground was now littered with the torn corpses of Furry Monkeys. Without me, Vivian, or An-hyeon stepping in, the caravan had handled the monsters splendidly. Hearing Go Yeon-ju’s whistle from behind, I lightly patted An-hyeon’s shoulder, signaling him to warm up by taking care of the one or two stragglers left.

---

Darkness had fully settled around us. After ordering the group to set up camp, I calmly studied the map. At our original pace, we’d have barely covered a tenth of the distance, but we were now close to a third of the way.

We hadn’t fought monsters on the first or second days, and on the third, we’d only had two battles. Yu-jeong shone against the Furry Monkeys, and Vivian excelled against the Landmoles, so we faced no major difficulties. Yu-jeong, perhaps eager to outdo An-hyeon, provoked him several times, but he didn’t budge. He was likely prioritizing my orders and was inwardly shocked by her rapid improvement.

After securing the campsite and eating a simple dinner, the group fell into a deep sleep. The fatigue from rapid marching likely outweighed the strain of combat.

“Leader, it’s time to switch.”

I lifted my head, stirred by someone gently shaking me. Looking up, I saw Shin Sang-yong smiling softly. I slipped out of my sleeping bag, cracking my neck side to side, relishing the satisfying ache.

“Anything unusual?”

“No. I set up mana detection and alarm spells, but nothing was picked up.”

“Good work. I’ve got it from here, so get some rest.”

“Yawn. Alright, I’m off to bed.”

Shin Sang-yong, visibly exhausted, let out a big yawn and crawled into his sleeping bag. I scanned the dense shrubbery around us. As expected from his diligence, there were no signs of monsters. Turning back to the group, I located An-sol and quietly approached her.

Looking down, I saw her face buried in her sleeping bag, slightly frowning. Listening closely, I caught faint groans. I reached into my pack, pulled out a potion, and carefully lifted her by her armpits.

“Mmm… huh? Oppa?” 

An-sol’s eyelids fluttered open, and she jolted, glancing around in surprise. Seeing my face, her eyes softened, and as I gently shushed her, she relaxed, letting her body go limp and leaning into me. I carefully pulled her out, lifted her slender legs, and removed her socks.

“Tch. You should’ve used a healing spell.”

Her once-pristine feet were cracked and rough from the grueling march. Clicking my tongue, I opened the potion and began applying it gently. As her feet gradually returned to their smooth state, I continued massaging them, focusing on the reddened areas. Even in her sleep, An-sol seemed to feel my touch, squirming slightly and nestling her feet closer to me. She must’ve been cold, pulled out from her warm sleeping bag.

After tucking her back in, I gently stroked her head. She breathed softly, rubbing her head against my hand, perhaps dreaming something pleasant.

In the past, she might’ve cried and refused to keep up, but this time, she’d endured and followed along admirably. Confirming her steady breathing, I let out a deep sigh.

Everything felt like it was going too smoothly. Almost *too* smoothly.
