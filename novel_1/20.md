# Memorize - Chapter 19 (19/1068): A Brief Parting

*Thud! Crack!*

*Thump.*

After crushing the head of the last remaining Deadman, I leaned against a tree. Scattered around me were the remains of Deadmen, their heads smashed to pieces. I had taken them down one by one, conserving my strength as much as possible, and it was over in no time. It was a one-sided slaughter. Yet, I couldn’t feel satisfied. Far from relieving my tension, I was left with a lingering sense of unease.

“*Tch.*”

I spat on the wreckage before me, but the bloodlust I had been suppressing surged even stronger, as if rebelling against my restraint. My chest felt tight, and though I took deep breaths to calm myself, it only fanned the flames. For a moment, I wondered if I even wanted to suppress this feeling at all.

“Damn it. This isn’t some kid’s game. All it did was whet my appetite.”

Unable to contain the rising urge to kill, I lashed out and struck the tree beside me.

*Boom! Rustle…*

Even without channeling any mana, the sheer force of my raw strength sent the sturdy tree crashing down with a heavy thud. It eased my frustration slightly, but the seething bloodlust within me didn’t fully subside.

With my party members gone, I was tempted to set this whole forest ablaze, but I held back. Even after crossing the stone wall, I had no idea what kind of monsters might be lurking outside. I was worried about the others, and I needed to retrieve my arrows, so there was no time to dawdle.

Since no one was watching, I focused on regulating the mana I had been holding back and moved swiftly.

Trees, foliage, and the surrounding scenery blurred past me. In what felt like no time at all, I arrived back at the stone mound where I had been earlier, despite the time I’d spent fighting.

As I pulled arrows from the shattered heads of the Deadmen, I scanned the area with my senses. There was no sign of my party. As expected, they must have left immediately after I entered the forest.

“One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… That should be enough.”

I wanted to stuff the arrows back into my quiver, but knowing An-sol might freak out if she saw the gore, I roughly cleaned them off.

*Time to head out.*

My party might be waiting just beyond the wall, so I started walking slowly. Before crossing, I turned to look at the silent forest.

The forest was unchanged. It looked the same now as it had back then. When I escaped this forest in the past, I was too busy running for my life to think about anything else. I just kept running until, before I knew it, I was out.

But now, things were different. I stared at the forest for a while, feeling an odd sense of relief, as if I had set down a heavy burden.

After indulging in that fleeting sentiment, I leaped over the wall. I wasn’t one to get caught up in pointless moods. Right now, I had more important things to focus on.

After vaulting over the stone wall, the sight that greeted me was far beyond my expectations. The path I stood on was rough and uneven but bore clear signs of human touch. Though subtle, the sides were consistently shaped, if not perfectly smooth.

Below the path stretched a vast plain, its horizon endless. The surroundings were quiet, with only the occasional gentle breeze stirring the air.

No monsters were in sight, no matter how hard I looked. But my party was also nowhere to be found. Even when I extended my mana to sense them, I couldn’t pick up their presence. A fleeting thought crossed my mind: *Did they abandon me?*

With three members of our group having a Good alignment, the likelihood of betrayal was relatively low. But I couldn’t judge based solely on alignment.

If they hadn’t abandoned me, the alternative was grim—they might have run into trouble while waiting for me. The Rite of Passage featured more than just Deadmen; there were plenty of other monsters. Deciding to assume something had happened, I set out to find traces of my party.

Tracking wasn’t difficult for me. As I calmly followed the stone wall, I spotted a patch of soil with deep sneaker prints. It seemed they had crossed the wall in this direction.

Following the trail, I found more signs of where my party had gathered. After confirming no threats were nearby, they must have waited for me here. Realizing this, the faint pang of betrayal I had felt melted away like snow.

Crouching at the spot where they had gathered, I examined the ground closely. A skilled ranger or tracker could deduce the who, what, when, where, and why of a situation. I wasn’t at that level, but with my sharp observation and abilities, I could make do.

I enhanced my vision to study the footprints, memorizing the patterns of my party’s sneakers before examining the remaining tracks. The ground was a chaotic mess of prints, as if they’d been dancing a shuffle. It would take time to sort them out. A flicker of unease passed through my mind, but I told myself it was too early to jump to conclusions and kept analyzing.

After about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, I finished my analysis and stood, stretching my legs. Excluding my party’s footprints, I found no unusual tracks. There was one deep imprint where the soil had been pressed down, but it was overlaid with a sneaker pattern, making it hard to tell if it belonged to my group.

There were no drag marks, so it couldn’t be a Deadman. I considered the possibility of a boss monster but shook my head. We were barely half a day into the Rite of Passage, and boss monsters had specific conditions for appearing.

Pushing thoughts of boss monsters aside, nothing stood out as a clear answer. That left me with one final option. Knowing it was a long shot, I began to activate my mana circuits.

With an explosive surge of mana, I triggered my Third Eye. What I was about to attempt was far beyond simply reading someone’s user information.

I hadn’t expected to need this much mana so early, but with time running out and no better ideas, I had to act. Hesitating or relying on mana detection alone could cost me the chance to save them if something happened.

What I aimed to observe with my Third Eye wasn’t the present—it was the *past*. If the conditions were met, this unique ability could even peer into higher dimensions. Seeing the past or future of this dimension was entirely within its capabilities, depending on my skill.

Just as a flicker of doubt crossed my mind, a scene flashed into my eyes, drawing my focus naturally.

*Crackle!*

“Ugh…!”

I only glimpsed it for a second before the scene in my vision distorted, and a massive shock hit my eyes. It felt like my retinas were burning, as if set ablaze. Reflexively rubbing my eyes, I let out a bitter laugh.

Just one second. I had seen a single moment of the past, and my Third Eye was forcibly canceled. As the pain in my eyes subsided, I muttered in a hollow voice.

“Ha… Haha. To think that 96 Mana Points can only handle one second… This is insane.”

I had hoped, but my mana stat couldn’t withstand the overdrive of my unique ability. It reaffirmed just how high-level the Third Eye was, but it also left me frustrated.

Seeing the past was treated on par with seeing the future—a feat far beyond simple foresight. I had thought my S-rank Third Eye might pull it off, but the forced activation’s two-rank penalty held me back. Even with the one-rank boost from Hwa-jeong, I could only observe the present fully; delving into the past or future was still beyond me.

The pain in my eyes was fading, but my vision remained blurry—likely the aftereffect of the mana backlash from the canceled spell. Thankfully, as time passed, objects came into sharper focus, suggesting the damage wasn’t permanent.

Though I had taken a risky gamble, I had gained something.

For just one second, I had undeniably seen the *past*. Recalling the scene that flashed across my retinas, I let out a deep sigh. After gathering a group of promising talents and barely escaping the forest, an even tougher challenge awaited me.

If it was a matter of lacking strength, I could accept it. But the reality of having to hold back despite having power made me even more depressed. If it came to it, I could wreak havoc on the Rite of Passage, but that was a last resort.

It felt like climbing one mountain only to find another waiting.
