# Chapter 91: Jackpot, Jackpot, and Another Jackpot

“…They all feel kind of worn out, don’t they?”  
“Totally.”  

I heard the disappointed voices of Yujeong and An-hyeon. But I was already activating my Third Eye, carefully examining each weapon one by one. Many of the weapons, weathered by time, were barely functional. And since the kids had recently upgraded their gear, it was true that the items we were looking at now seemed a bit lackluster in comparison.  

Still, among these, there were bound to be items imbued with powerful magic, capable of retaining their form even after ages. While the kids were carelessly tossing things aside, I picked up the discarded items and inspected them meticulously.  

“Oppa, what’s this?”  

At An-sol’s voice, I whipped my head around like lightning. A gut feeling told me that anything chosen by An-sol, with her 100-point Luck stat, would be extraordinary. The others seemed to sense it too, as they all turned to look at An-sol simultaneously. Feeling the weight of everyone’s gazes, An-sol flinched and took a step back.  

“Why?”  
“This…”  

What An-sol held out was none other than a bracelet. Though it was covered in rust, my senses picked up something special about it. I immediately took it from her. After examining the bracelet closely, I turned to Jeong Ha-yeon.  

“Ha-yeon-ssi, can you use the Restore spell?”  
“Restore magic? Of course. But it only restores the outer appearance and internal functionality. I can’t do anything about durability or other aspects.”  
“That’s the blacksmith’s job. That’s good enough.”  
“Then hand it over.”  

As I passed the bracelet to Jeong Ha-yeon, the kids’ bored eyes suddenly sparkled with interest. Unable to hold back, An-hyeon spoke up.  

“Hyung, what’s with that bracelet?”  
“I’m not sure yet. I want to see it after the Restore spell.”  

Of course, with my Third Eye, I already had a rough idea of what it was. I’d even decided it would go to An-hyeon. The reason I asked for the Restore spell was that it felt a bit off to use it as-is, and I wanted to at least clean off the rust.  

Jeong Ha-yeon held the bracelet and softly chanted the spell. Then, with a delicate finger, she lightly tapped the center of the bracelet. A bright light enveloped it, and soon, the rust flaked off, revealing the bracelet’s polished surface. It gleamed with a soft, moonlit glow. Jeong Ha-yeon’s eyes widened in surprise.  

“Could this be…?”  
“Heh, An-sol hit the jackpot.”  

The kids’ faces lit up with curiosity. Jeong Ha-yeon inspected the bracelet further, then handed it back to me with a look of envy.  

“Congratulations. Its mana efficiency is far higher than regular steel. This is just a guess, but… it might contain a small amount of mithril. Depending on how you use it, it could even channel mana.”  
“Mithril? Unni, is that good?”  

At Yujeong’s question, Jeong Ha-yeon nodded.  
“Absolutely. Mithril is an extremely rare mineral. It’s lighter than regular steel, incredibly durable, and… well, its mana efficiency is exceptional.”  
“Is it expensive?”  
“…It’s priceless.”  

I slipped a finger through the bracelet’s loop and spun it around. To be precise, it contained 5.7% mithril. While it didn’t boost the wearer’s stats, simply equipping it significantly enhanced mana efficiency. It was safe to say it outperformed any gear we currently had. I handed the bracelet to An-hyeon, who was practically drooling.  

“Try it on.”  
“Huh? No, hyung, you should—”  
“Really? Alright then.”  

At An-hyeon’s refusal, I casually pulled the bracelet back. His face twisted oddly, his eyes glued to it. I chuckled and handed it back.  

“Kidding. Don’t say things you don’t mean. If you don’t want it, I’ll give it to Yujeong.”  

At that, An-hyeon snatched the bracelet eagerly. Amid the envious glances of the group, the bracelet automatically adjusted to fit his wrist perfectly. Oh, it even had an auto-resize function?  

“…How’s it feel?”  
“Hmm.”  

An-hyeon tilted his head, tapping the bracelet lightly.  
“I’m not sure yet, but… I feel more energized. The flow of my mana seems faster too.”  

That was good enough. An-hyeon, fascinated, stopped searching and kept fiddling with his new bracelet. The rest of us left him to it and resumed our search. Thanks to An-sol’s find, the kids were now rummaging through the items with even more enthusiasm, and An-sol herself was eyeing the scattered objects with a hungry look.  

At first, the kids had been tossing things aside carelessly, but now they brought me anything that looked remotely promising. Unfortunately, whether due to low Luck or poor judgment, most of what they showed me was junk.  

They kept shoving things in my face until I finally snapped, and only then did they settle down. I decided to set aside anything decent for a thorough check later.  

Since we’d splurged on new gear before this expedition, nothing among the gloves stood out. Even the chest plates, armor, and shields the kids were currently using seemed better than what we found.  

Realizing this might take a while, I decided we’d take a big rest here. After a wide sweep with my detection to confirm no one was around, I called over Shin Sang-yong. He politely declined once or twice, but when I insisted, he scurried over eagerly. It seemed he’d been itching to join in. And so, we spent a solid thirty minutes sorting through the items.  

“Phew, is this about it?”  
“Unni, hurry up!”  
“Hey, hold on a sec.”  

Soon, we tossed the junk aside and gathered the decent items in the center, sitting around them. Jeong Ha-yeon was casting Restore on each piece. While she worked, I tallied the gold and gems.  

We had 32 ten-gold coins and 58 one-gold coins—a respectable haul totaling 378 gold. There were also eight large rubies, each worth at least 100 gold.  

Setting up an official clan required a lot of money, but with this, I wouldn’t need to dip into the gem pouch Vivian gave us. The kids stared at the gold and rubies with dreamy eyes, as if all their hard work had finally paid off.  

I glanced over to see Jeong Ha-yeon catching her breath. She’d just finished casting Restore and was gazing at the items with a wistful look. In front of her were a dagger, a cloak, and two rings—four items in total. Including An-hyeon’s bracelet, we’d scored five treasures. I quickly activated my Third Eye as Jeong Ha-yeon began speaking.  

“I don’t know where to start, but first, congratulations. The dagger is just one blade, but it seems to have a magic enchantment that boosts the wearer’s attack speed. However… it’s not really suited for combat. It feels more decorative.”  

She held up the dagger. It resembled a stiletto—a thin, sharp, awl-like blade—but it didn’t look practical for fighting. Maybe for assassins, but…  

“Unni, is it good?”  
“Well, technically, it’s valuable. Weapons with permanent special abilities like this aren’t easy to come by.”  
“Oh…”  

Yujeong immediately turned to me. I responded calmly.  
“Sure.”  
“Ahhh!”  

Unable to resist her pleading puppy eyes, I nodded slightly. Yujeong grabbed the dagger with the speed of a hawk snatching prey. Though its blade was much shorter than the one I’d gotten her, she looked thrilled as she tucked it away.  

Jeong Ha-yeon pointed to the cloak next.  
“This cloak looks faded and ordinary, but it’s enchanted with magic resistance. I’m not sure to what extent, though. We’d need to get it appraised in the city to know for sure.”  
“That’s plenty.”  

Taking the cloak from her, I gave a faint smile. I recognized this cloak. It was designed to defend against fire-based magic—likely the Block of Fire. It could block a certain level of magical damage and reduce up to 40% of any excess. Not only that, despite looking like simple cloth, it was imbued with physical resistance, making it far tougher than ordinary fabric. This was an item that would cost at least 600 gold, even at a bargain. This cloak was perfect for…  

“Vivian.”  
“Woo! Thanks!”  

As Vivian gleefully draped the cloak over herself, Jeong Ha-yeon shot her an envious glance but quickly composed herself. She picked up the two rings and placed them on her palm.  

“These two rings are probably the best finds so far. They’re really…”  

Jeong Ha-yeon paused, staring at the rings. I smiled faintly. I could hear Shin Sang-yong swallowing hard nearby. Finally, one of the rings I’d been hoping for had appeared. Unfortunately, it was useless to me.  

Looking at the ring I’d singled out, Jeong Ha-yeon turned to me.  
“Suhyeon-ssi, would you try this one on? I’m not certain, but it might boost your magic power stat. I don’t sense any specific magical ability, but the moment I held it, my body’s mana reacted. I’ve only heard of this happening—it’s my first time experiencing it.”  

A collective gasp echoed through the group. Even the kids, who’d learned about this at the User Academy, knew that stat-boosting items were priceless. I calmly took the ring from her and slipped it on. Checking my user info, as expected, there was no increase in my magic power stat. I let out a disappointed sigh.  

The ring definitely boosted stats, but like Vivian’s core, it only worked for users with a magic power stat below 90. It also had a binding function. The tricky part was, if my magic power had been 89 and I equipped the ring, it would’ve raised it to 90. Even if my stat later grew past 90, the bound ring would still boost it. But for me, with a magic power stat of 96, it was useless. I sighed again and removed the ring. Since I didn’t meet the requirements, there was no worry about it binding.  

“Suhyeon-ssi…?”  
“Sol, come here.”  

Jeong Ha-yeon’s voice carried a hint of confusion, but I called An-sol softly. She’d been quietly watching but perked up at my call, scurrying over to my side.  

“This is better for you.”  
“Huh…?”  

Everyone stared at me in shock. I just shrugged under their piercing gazes.  

“Suhyeon-ssi, I didn’t mention earlier since I wasn’t sure, but this ring might have a binding function. Choose carefully—whether to give it up or…”  

She knew. But I’d already decided to give it to An-sol, so there was no hesitation. I shook my head firmly.  
“It’s fine. It’s better for a class that relies on magic power to use it.”  
“…If you sold it, you could get at least 20,000 gold.”  
“We have enough money. It’s better for An-sol to use it. Sol, put it on.”  
“O… oraboni…”  
“Wow… Leader, you’re really something…”  

Shin Sang-yong’s voice was filled with awe, and Jeong Ha-yeon looked at me with newfound respect. By caravan tradition, the best items typically went to the leader—an unspoken rule. By giving up a stat-boosting item for An-sol, I seemed to have earned some admiration. In truth, it was just useless to me, but I figured it was better to let this positive misunderstanding slide.  

“O… oraboni… I don’t know… you should just…”  

Hearing the 20,000-gold figure, An-sol looked overwhelmed, hesitating as she stared at the ring. I sighed, grabbed her left hand with one hand, and held out the ring with the other.  

“Ugh, come on. You’re not a kid anymore. When are you going to grow up?”  

An-sol kept trying to pull her hand away, but I held on tighter. Only when I forced her fingers open did she reluctantly extend her left ring finger.  

“Here?”  

She didn’t answer, just averted her gaze and nodded once or twice. As the ring slid onto her small, pale finger, it adjusted to fit perfectly, just like An-hyeon’s bracelet.  

Checking her user info, An-sol quietly announced that her magic power stat had increased by one point. The group erupted in cheers, all envious of her.  

“So, the rings are sorted. Now for the rest…”  

I wasn’t thinking much of it, but An-sol, her face flushed brighter than usual, kept turning her head away, avoiding my gaze. Was she embarrassed because this felt like something couples or fiancés do?  

Finding it cute, I brushed it off lightly. Little did I know the consequences this simple act would bring later.
