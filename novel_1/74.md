# Chapter 73: The Pet Creation Project

As we re-entered Mul through the northern gate we had left from, the kids’ faces noticeably brightened. Though they didn’t say it outright, their eager expressions suggested they’d collapse on the spot if I suggested training right then and there. I let out a soft chuckle, pulled a small pouch from my pocket, and tossed it to An-hyeon. He was carrying another user on his back and looked flustered, but thankfully, Yu-jeong stepped in and deftly caught the pouch.

“Good job,” I said.

“Don’t just praise me—give me a reward!” she teased.

“Here you go.”

Without hesitation, I handed over the user I’d been carrying to Yu-jeong. She grumbled a bit but accepted them gracefully. Watching her struggle slightly under the weight, I spoke up promptly.

“You know where the Modest Lady Inn is, right? There’s enough money in the pouch, so book two rooms for a week. Have dinner first—eat whatever you want. Then head in and rest.”

“What about you, oppa?” Yu-jeong asked.

“I’ve got some business with Vivian. Plus, I need to report our expedition.”

“Can’t we come with—”

“I’d rather handle it alone. It’s fine, go rest.”

Yu-jeong’s face dimmed briefly, but she soon nodded. It was clear she was torn between wanting to rest and her hunger driving her toward the inn. Honestly, it was a bit of a hassle, but it was something that needed to be done.

After sending the kids off, I was finally alone with Vivian. She pouted at me, letting out a heavy sigh.

“You’re impossible to figure out,” she said.

“What do you mean?”

“You and those kids.”

I raised an eyebrow, silently mouthing “Why?” as she shot me a sharp look. Pointing an accusing finger, she raised her voice.

“They’re not baby birds, you know! Always chirping and clinging to you—it’s annoying to watch. And you’re just as bad! You dote on them like they’re your pets. Spoiling them rotten. Why don’t you just pat their butts while you’re at it?”

“Is that how I come off?” I asked, amused.

“Oh, really? So it’s fine if I start whining and acting like that too?”

Instead of answering, I raised my hand. Vivian’s eyes flicked to it warily before she sighed again. Just as she opened her mouth to complain further, I gently placed my hand on her head.

“How’s your body?” I asked.

“Wha—what?” she stammered.

“I said, how’s your body feeling?”

Caught off guard by my sudden shift, Vivian’s eyes darted around, her face flustered as she mumbled incoherently. Finally, she glanced up at me cautiously and spoke softly.

“It’s… fine for now. I can manage. But, uh, your hand…”

I gave her head a gentle pat before turning away. I sensed a slight hesitation behind me, but soon felt her presence as she hurried to follow. If we were going to work together, building trust was essential—and treating her kindly now and then would help me get the most out of her.

The streets of Mul were noticeably livelier than they had been that morning when we left. Most users seemed to be heading to the temple to report their expeditions, just like me, though I spotted a few groups venturing out despite the late hour. Silently, I wished them luck.

Before heading to the temple, I stopped by the user warehouse. It would’ve been a hassle if the temple and warehouse were on opposite sides of the city, but fortunately, they were roughly in the same direction, even if it meant a slight detour. As we approached the temple, the crowd grew denser—not as chaotic as Barbara, but still busy with users milling about.

Vivian, meanwhile, was drawing attention. Embarrassed, she kept her head down and pressed closer to me. The soft sensation against my back was pleasant, but it also attracted jealous glares from passersby. In the Northern Continent, with its strict discipline and security, this was manageable. But in the Western Continent, her outfit would’ve been tantamount to shouting, “I’m dressed like this because I want to be taken! Come get me!” Not that I was worried—once her strength was restored, Vivian was more than capable. Most users wouldn’t stand a chance against her; they’d be lucky to walk away intact.

Upon reaching the user warehouse, I retrieved a single bottle of elixir and all my gold coins. My current stash exceeded 1,200 gold—a fortune for a user just starting out. Add in the gems and other items I could sell, and it was an almost obscene amount of wealth. The more money I had, the easier my plans would be. With a specific use already in mind, I tucked the heavy coin pouch into my pocket.

“What’s that?” Vivian asked, her curiosity piqued as I spun a bright yellow vial in my hand.

“An elixir,” I replied simply.

The word alone sent a ripple through her. Vivian’s expression shifted dramatically—she let out a sharp “Ha!” and snorted, gesturing for me to hand it over.

“Ugh, seriously?”

“You know about elixirs, don’t you?”

“Duh. Alchemists make potions, you know. Elixirs are the pinnacle of that craft. Fine, I’ll play along—hand it over.”

“Why don’t you come closer and take a look?”

Grumbling, Vivian leaned in, her eyes narrowing as she inspected the vial closely. Her expression grew increasingly strange, and just as she reached for it, I pulled it back. As an experienced alchemist, she clearly sensed something significant. Her face turned serious, a stark contrast to her earlier playfulness.

“That’s… weird. Hold on, don’t pull it away—let me see it up close…”

“No need for that. Why not just take a sip?”

I’d already made up my mind. Hesitating wasn’t my style once a decision was set. I popped open the vial’s seal, poured a small amount into the cap, and handed it to Vivian. She took it eagerly, sniffed it briefly, and then downed it in one gulp.

“Mmm…” she murmured.

“Well? How is it?”

“Just… wait… huh? Wha—what?”

Vivian froze, her eyes widening as she savored the elixir’s effects. She seemed to realize something profound was happening within her body. I immediately activated my Third Eye, this time with greater intensity, determined to uncover every detail of her status.

Was this Vivian’s true power fully restored? I let out a small gasp, looking at her with renewed respect. As I’ve said before, for mages and priests, Magic stats are paramount. Even if other stats average around 30, a Magic stat above 90 would make any user a hot commodity in any clan. That’s the kind of presence mages hold in the Hall Plane.

Her special ability, *Ruler of the 66 Beast Legion* (Rank: A+++), particularly piqued my curiosity. While Rare classes don’t quite match Secret classes, they far surpass standard ones in unique capabilities. Standard classes can become powerful with proper development, but Rare classes maximize combat efficiency, and Secret classes wield overwhelming *Authority*. That’s why every user dreams of attaining one of these classes.

Snapping out of my thoughts, I turned my attention forward. Vivian, who had been examining her body with a flustered expression, suddenly looked frantic—no, not frantic. Her eyes were wild, almost unhinged.

A brief silence hung between us, but it didn’t last. Clenching her teeth, Vivian lunged at me.

“Give it to meeee!” she shouted.

“Whoa, easy there.”

I thrust out a hand to block her face. She flailed her arms wildly, trying to reach me, but it was futile. Undeterred, she grew even more frenzied, clawing for the elixir in my hand.

“Give it! Give it to me! Now!” she demanded.

“I can’t just hand it over like that. What if you chug it and pretend nothing happened?”

“I won’t! I swear! Just give it to me!”

I pushed her back firmly, but she came charging again. Sighing, I extended my hand again—this time, aiming for her chest instead of her head. As she barreled into me, my right hand closed around a soft, pliable sensation. Oh. This feels nice.

“Kyaaa!” she squealed.

“Mmm. Not bad,” I said, grinning.

“Huh? Kyah? Wha—?!”

I kneaded the softness in my hand, nodding appreciatively. It had been a while since I’d felt a woman’s chest, and a strange thrill coursed through me. Vivian, startled, tried to pull back, but I held on, gripping her chest firmly. Only when her chest stretched uncomfortably did she finally retract her hands.

“What are you doing?! Let go, you idiot!” she yelled.

“Moron. Who told you to charge at me like that?”

She grabbed my hand with both of hers, forcibly prying it off. Though I was a bit reluctant, I let go willingly. Perhaps I’d gripped too hard—Vivian’s eyes glistened with tears as she gingerly rubbed her chest.

“Sniff… I’m ruined…” she whimpered.

“All this fuss over a little grab? Anyway, this proves I have a way to heal you, right?”

I leaned back, exuding confidence, and Vivian nodded vigorously, her eyes gleaming with a question: *How do I get that elixir?* Chuckling, I continued.

“I’ve already decided to give it to you, so just wait a bit. But you need to make one solid promise first.”

“I remember what you said in the dungeon,” she replied.

“You don’t even know what I’m planning.”

My sharp retort left her speechless, like a mute who’d swallowed honey. She hadn’t yet regained the lofty intellect of her alchemist days, and her desperation for the elixir clouded her judgment. This was the exact *opening* I’d been waiting for. If she took the elixir and ran off or turned uncooperative, I’d be out a precious resource. I needed to take precautions.

“So, what do I have to do?” she asked, her voice small.

I smirked. “Let’s make a contract.”

“A contract?”

Tilting her head in confusion, she echoed my words. I grinned wider and replied, “Yup, a contract. Let’s head to the temple. We’ll report the expedition and draft the contract there.”
