# Memorize - Chapter 29: Why Are You Acting Like That?

‘Just to be clear, are you guys also heading to the warp gate in the central area?’

‘You won’t be able to make it.’

‘I’m not saying this lightly. Don’t go. We managed to get within 300 meters of the warp gate just two days ago. But we failed.’

‘Why? Because we ended up retreating after standing around helplessly. If we had decided a bit faster… Jin-tae might…’

‘You know the survival conditions, right? It’s better to just hold out for seven days. Especially against *that thing*—you can’t win. If it hadn’t been for Jin-tae back then, we’d all have been killed by that monster. Even from a distance, it locked onto exactly where we were.’

‘That monster…’

*

The conditions for a boss monster’s appearance are tied to lingering too long at designated points. There’s also the random spawn factor, but that’s unpredictable. Honestly, I was more surprised that Woo Jeong-min’s group reached the warp gate in just three days than by the idea of a boss monster appearing near it.

Well, it’s not entirely unbelievable when you consider that Woo Jeong-min and Seon Yu-un, who later become renowned in the Hall Plane, were part of that group. The memory of Won Hye-su’s tear-streaked face, screaming curses at me, flashed through my mind. Her words didn’t bother me much. I knew all too well the pain of losing someone dear. I’d been there myself. After losing my brother and *her*, I went half-mad for a while. If you gathered all the blood I spilled back then, it could probably fill a few puddles.

“An-hyeon.”

As we walked, Lee Yu-jeong’s voice called out to An-hyeon. When he looked up, she spoke in an uncharacteristically quiet tone.

“Thank you.”

“For what?”

“For… saving me earlier.”

An-hyeon tilted his head, then let out an “Aha” as realization dawned, nodding.

“Your temper’s the problem. You need to rein it in. If I hadn’t been keeping an eye on that guy from the start, you’d have a dagger in your forehead right now.”

“He was getting on my nerves!”

“Still, you can’t just lose it like that. Try acting even half as nice to others as you do to Su-hyeon oppa. Or maybe take after Han-byeol’s personality a bit. What good is a pretty face if your attitude’s a mess?”

“P-pretty…?” Lee Yu-jeong’s face flushed at An-hyeon’s comment, and she whipped her head away with a huff. “Hmph! Su-hyeon oppa only puts up with us because we’re a handful. Anyway, I don’t like what I don’t like.”

Seeing Lee Yu-jeong’s unexpectedly girlish reaction, An-hyeon’s eyes widened. It was a huge step forward for her. I’d been worried they’d start bickering again, but thankfully, it seemed to pass smoothly.

Just then, An-sol grabbed the hem of An-hyeon’s clothes. He instinctively reached out and gently patted her head. Seeing An-sol’s beaming face, Lee Yu-jeong’s eyes narrowed sharply. Only the oblivious An-hyeon, unaware of the subtle tension around him, kept scanning our surroundings diligently. Honestly, why are popular guys always so dense? Tsk tsk.

After walking for a while, we spotted a save point as the sun began to set. We hadn’t encountered a single monster on the way. The others were thrilled, saying we’d gotten lucky, but I wasn’t so sure it was something to celebrate.

Ever since leaving the forest—aside from a brief stop in the city—we’d been constantly ambushed by monsters. An-sol had even stopped screaming at the sight of mangi corpses. Sure, I’d deliberately led us into some of those encounters, but the group had earned some respite from all the hardship.

The area around the warp gate was home to monsters with some degree of intelligence. The fact that we’d taken down five mangi, among the top-tier threats in the Rite of Passage, was proof of that. Those creatures likely knew how many of their kind had been killed by us. Their keen senses could probably smell the blood on us.

That’s what I’d thought, at least. But after talking with Woo Jeong-min, I changed my mind. If a boss monster had appeared and was lurking near the warp gate, no ordinary monster would dare roam nearby, no matter how bold. The boss would be at the top of the food chain.

In other words, if we didn’t encounter any monsters tomorrow either, it meant we, like Woo Jeong-min’s group, had a high chance of facing the boss monster near the warp gate. It was ironic. I’d left the city to avoid a boss monster, only to risk running into one again.

There was a difference, though. In the city, we’d have faced it with 100% certainty. Now, the odds were less predictable.

As I mulled this over, a question struck me. There were clear conditions for a boss monster’s appearance, and we weren’t the only survivors in the Rite of Passage. What would happen if multiple groups triggered those conditions at the same time? Add to that the high likelihood of a boss spawning near the warp gate, and things got even murkier.

I realized I knew next to nothing about the Rite of Passage. I’d spent ten years in the Hall Plane, researching nearly everything there was to know, but the Rite of Passage was different. All I had were fragments of gossip I’d overheard from other users, treated as mere anecdotes. It wasn’t enough to feel suffocated, but an uneasy feeling lingered.

How much time had passed? Eventually, we found the save point.

“It’s got a yellow roof. Looks like a cabin,” Lee Yu-jeong noted.

“We’re lucky to find one again today. Should we rest here, even if it’s a bit early? Hyung, that okay?” An-hyeon asked.

“Don’t stay longer than a day. There’s a warning sign here too. Still, it looks better than the last one, right, oppa?” Lee Yu-jeong added.

“I’m going in first. I want to wash up and change. Hehe,” An-sol chimed in.

“…”

“Hyung?”

“Oppa?”

“Huh? Oh, yeah. Let’s do that.”

I nodded hastily, and everyone looked at me strangely. I shook my head, signaling it was nothing.

Watching the group chatter away, I sighed inwardly. Such carefree kids. This is why group travel is a hassle. If I’d been alone, I’d probably already be in the Hall Plane by now. Since no clear solution came to mind, I decided to shelve the thought for now. I realized I’d mellowed out a lot.

Back when I knew nothing, any survival-related issue would’ve kept me up, frantically searching for answers. Not anymore. Deep down, I’d developed a mindset: if things went south, I’d just cut through anything in my way.

“Oppa, what are you doing? We’re going in!” Lee Yu-jeong called, waving brightly.

“…Coming.”

I started walking calmly toward her. For now, I’d think about tomorrow when it came.

*

Night had fallen. I sat on the steps leading up to the cabin, keeping watch. An-hyeon and I weren’t the only ones taking shifts anymore. Now, Lee Yu-jeong, Kim Han-byeol, An-hyeon, and I rotated. We didn’t have a strict schedule, just switching when it felt like enough time had passed.

Lee Yu-jeong took the first shift, followed by me. Kim Han-byeol was third, and An-hyeon was last. Each shift was about two hours. But barely an hour into her shift—by my estimate—Lee Yu-jeong started whining about switching. She avoided my gaze, clearly embarrassed about slacking off.

As I reached into my pocket, my hand brushed against a chocolate bar. Deciding to let it slide, I started to head out. Feeling guilty, she slipped the chocolate bar into my pocket—she must’ve swiped it earlier. Since we weren’t short on food or drink, I didn’t say anything. It was about time to switch with Kim Han-byeol anyway, so I figured I’d eat the chocolate and head in.

Just as I was about to open the wrapper, a coffee drink was thrust toward my right cheek. Turning, I saw Kim Han-byeol bent over, staring at me.

“Hiding snacks to eat alone, huh?”

“…Yu-jeong gave it to me.”

“That unni doesn’t share sweets, especially chocolate.”

“She didn’t stick to her watch time. Guess she felt bad about whining and gave it to me.”

Kim Han-byeol gave a wry smile and sat beside me. I broke the chocolate bar in half and offered her a piece, which she accepted readily.

“Thanks.”

“I’ll enjoy the coffee.”

Kim Han-byeol was much more at ease with me now compared to before. She wasn’t as lively as Lee Yu-jeong, and there was still some distance between us, but it had lessened. We were the only ones in the group still using formal speech with each other. It had just become an unspoken rule.

“You looked deep in thought. Your expression wasn’t great. Didn’t even notice me coming,” she said.

I noticed. I just pretended not to. I kept that to myself, taking a sip of coffee before replying.

“Haha, guess I zoned out. My expression was bad?”

“Yeah. After talking with that guy this afternoon, you seemed a bit tense. Or am I wrong?”

Was it that obvious? I thought I always kept a neutral face. I rubbed my cheek unconsciously, and Kim Han-byeol added calmly, “So, what did you two talk about?”

“…It was nothing.”

“I’m not the only one who noticed. An-hyeon oppa, Yu-jeong unni, even Sol—they’re all quietly worried. You’ve barely said a word since.”

“I was just thinking things over. It’ll work out. I’m sure of it. Even if something happens, we’ll handle it. Don’t worry too much.”

With that, I popped the rest of the chocolate and coffee into my mouth. Talking to her was bringing back strong memories of *her*. I wanted to leave. I told her to take care of the watch and turned to head up the steps.

“Wait. I still have something to ask.”

In novels, manga, or dramas, the male lead would’ve been let go smoothly. Why wasn’t she letting me off? I had a bad feeling about this. I’d sensed something off when she insisted on taking this shift instead of An-hyeon. Trying to keep my tone gentle, I said, “I’m a bit tired. If it’s okay, can we talk tomorrow? I want to sleep.”

“I want to hear it now.”

“I’m not going anywhere.”

I tried to lighten the mood with a joke, but it didn’t work. Kim Han-byeol’s face had turned cold, her eyes fixed on me. Over her face, *her* face overlapped. I instinctively looked away.

“I feel like if I don’t ask now, I won’t get another chance.”

“Ah, about what he said? It’s really nothing—”

“Oppa.”

I shut my mouth instantly. Was it because she called me oppa? No, I’m not some creep who gets excited over that.

“Su-hyeon oppa. That’s not what I want to ask about.”

Kim Han-byeol’s face remained calm and cold, but there was a different intensity to it. She was angry—not in a loud way, but with a quiet force that demanded I stay and face her. She looked at me head-on, and I realized she was serious. My expression settled, and I met her gaze with steady eyes. Only then did she speak.
