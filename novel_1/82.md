# 메모라이즈-81화 (81/1068) New Face

As expected, the users who entered through the inn’s door were Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong. When I turned to look at them, it was hard to say they looked well, even as a courtesy. Shin Sang-yong seemed relatively fine, but Jeong Ha-yeon’s face was noticeably pale, likely from the emotional toll she had endured. Still, her clear, lively eyes suggested that her spirit hadn’t been entirely crushed.

Jeong Ha-yeon had an inexplicably captivating presence. It wasn’t just about her appearance. My subjective judgment, honed by ten years of experience in the Hall Plane and reading people, told me this woman was the real deal. It was a complex feeling, hard to articulate, but it screamed that I needed to hold onto this user.

That said, I couldn’t reveal my true intentions. Maintaining as neutral an expression as possible, I stood up from my seat and greeted them.

“I heard you came by this afternoon.”

“Yes. We were told you had gone outside the city with your party.”

“It wasn’t an expedition, just a brief outing to gain some combat experience. Sorry for making you come all this way for nothing.”

“No, please don’t say that. If anything, we’re the ones who feel bad for troubling you.”

So polite. She humbles herself without losing her dignity. Her refined response made me nod in acknowledgment. Yu-jeong, ever quick on the uptake, had already pulled up two extra chairs. We exchanged brief introductions with Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong before sitting down.

For a moment, Jeong Ha-yeon and Vivian locked eyes. But Vivian quickly averted her gaze, and an awkward atmosphere settled in. I promptly offered them food to ease the tension, but they politely declined, saying they had already eaten.

“Have you managed to sort out your feelings?” I asked.

“Honestly, no,” Jeong Ha-yeon replied. “It’s not easy to move on from a younger sibling’s death. Even now, I’m overwhelmed with grief, sadness, and anger.”

Her candid response made the kids gasp softly. Vivian, in particular, lowered her head deeply.

I pursed my lips at Jeong Ha-yeon’s directness. But it wasn’t a bad response. If she had lied to hide her grief, I might have been disappointed. I noticed Shin Sang-yong gently nudge her robe, and with a faint smile, Jeong Ha-yeon continued.

“After we parted ways with you all, I went back to the inn where my sister and I last stayed. I held her robe and cried my heart out. I probably cried all day.”

Her face now was remarkably calm and composed, almost as if her claim of crying felt like a lie. The kids looked at her with sympathy, but I didn’t. A strange chill ran through me.

I, too, had lost an older brother in my first cycle. Back then, I turned into a crazed, murderous beast for a week, slaughtering countless enemy users until blood flowed like rivers. Only then could I barely quell my rage. Even now, I stood here unable to forget my brother Yu-hyeon and Han So-yeong.

Jeong Ha-yeon’s demeanor stood in stark contrast to mine. If her composure was an act, she was a terrifying talent. But I had activated my Third Eye since their arrival, and it told me her sincerity was genuine.

I stared at her blankly for a moment, the urge to ask, *“How can you control your emotions like that?”* rising to my throat, though I managed to swallow it. She quietly met my gaze before turning to Vivian.

“I—we—killed your subordinates and your children. And you killed my sister and my companions.”

“…Yes,” Vivian replied softly.

“I won’t say I’m sorry for killing your subordinates and children. I’m not sorry. That’s just how humans are. But I want you to acknowledge that you did something terrible to my sister, at the very least, and sincerely apologize.”

“…”

“I still can’t accept it. But if the kindness Su-hyeon showed us and the words you spoke were true—if you’ve regained your human heart and aren’t a monster anymore—then show me proof of your sincerity now.”

Jeong Ha-yeon spoke with a resolute expression, while Shin Sang-yong fidgeted nervously, glancing between her and me. Her gentle charisma enveloped the room, and I found myself smiling faintly.

And then, far too easily compared to Jeong Ha-yeon’s resolve, Vivian bowed her head.

“I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry.”

“…?”

“I know and remember everything I did as a monster. My will was part of it. But if I had been human, if I had retained my human reason, I never would have done such things. I don’t hold it against you for killing my subordinates when you entered my dungeon. I don’t even think of them as subordinates anymore. But what I did to your sister and your companions—I don’t know how to beg for forgiveness. I sincerely apologize. I know these words aren’t enough, but I hope you can understand my heart.”

Vivian’s face was different from usual. Gone was her typical vacant expression; she was genuinely seeking forgiveness. Even Yu-jeong, who often teased Vivian, stared at her with her mouth agape. I, too, was quietly impressed by this new side of her before turning my attention back to Jeong Ha-yeon.

“…”

Jeong Ha-yeon said nothing. She opened her mouth, closed it, opened it again, and closed it once more. She seemed to want to speak but was choked up, unable to get the words out. Finally, she closed her eyes, visibly struggling to control the whirlwind of emotions within her.

A brief, awkward silence followed. But it didn’t last long. Jeong Ha-yeon opened her eyes and spoke in a dry voice, while Vivian kept her head bowed.

“Raise your head.”

“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”

“I don’t know what’s in your heart. But your outward attitude leaves me with nothing to say. Raise your head. And Su-hyeon, I’m sorry for speaking so harshly to your companion. But…”

I raised a hand to stop her. She caught my signal and quietly closed her mouth.

“You don’t need to say more. I’m protecting Vivian now, but I don’t condone what she did. I also fully empathize with and sympathize with your feelings, User Jeong Ha-yeon.”

“…Thank you.”

After finishing, Jeong Ha-yeon didn’t look at Vivian again. But she bowed politely to me and let out a deep sigh.

*

After resolving that incident, we went up to the room An-hyeon and I were using. The topics we needed to discuss could cause misunderstandings if overheard by other users, so we deliberately moved to the room. As soon as we opened the door, scattered record books and a densely annotated map caught my eye. Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong widened their eyes as they followed me inside.

With my permission, Jeong Ha-yeon examined the records and map. I chuckled inwardly as they studied them with intrigued expressions. The map they were looking at detailed how I discovered the Ancient Alchemist’s Dungeon and the process of locating the Ruined Laboratory we were currently exploring.

If they were as sharp as I thought, this would give them a sense of my capabilities as an explorer.

“S-S-Su-hyeon, did you really find the Ancient Alchemist’s Dungeon this way?” Shin Sang-yong asked.

“The method was similar, yes. Though luck played a part, of course.”

“W-Wow! This is incredible! To think you got this close with just these records, without any clues or information… Wow!”

Shin Sang-yong was practically bursting with excitement. He seemed introverted and a bit clumsy with people, often stuttering, but he clearly showed passion for things that interested him.

Jeong Ha-yeon, too, looked at the map with a lively expression before turning to me with admiration.

“That’s impressive. Did you really investigate all this on your own?”

“It’s a foolish endeavor,” I replied modestly.

“Don’t put yourself down. It’s easy to think of such methods, but actually executing them is incredibly difficult.”

“Unnie, is what Su-hyeon oppa did really that amazing?” Yu-jeong chimed in, eagerly seizing the chance to join the conversation. She’d been itching to talk since earlier, and now she’d finally jumped in. It was the first time I’d seen her act so friendly right off the bat. Jeong Ha-yeon, slightly taken aback, smiled warmly and continued.

“Many users call this kind of method ‘picking a star from the sky’ or ‘finding a needle in a haystack’—like winning the lottery. But what Su-hyeon did was more like finding a pebble in the sand or winning a regular lottery ticket. He significantly increased the odds.”

A subtle compliment, but Yu-jeong looked at me with newfound awe, her mouth open.

“Wow…”

“You asked if it’s a big deal? Yes, it’s a big deal. Su-hyeon’s been working hard.”

There was a slight edge to Jeong Ha-yeon’s final words. She glanced at the group, then at me. In her gaze, I caught a glimpse of her inner self. It felt strangely familiar, and I realized she shared some similarities with Kim Han-byeol.

Of course, she wasn’t a carbon copy of Kim Han-byeol, and their personalities differed in some ways. But there was a resemblance. The difference was that Jeong Ha-yeon had experienced the world earlier and knew how to temper her pride. If Kim Han-byeol gained more life experience, she might become like Jeong Ha-yeon. That was just my speculation, though.

After examining my records for a while, the two sat down in a circle with us. It was a bit comical since the inn wasn’t exactly high-end, and we didn’t have enough chairs. Sitting on the bed wasn’t an option either.

Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong exchanged a glance, nodded, and then turned to me.

“We came here today partly because of Vivian, but we also have a request for you, Su-hyeon.”

“Yes?” I prompted.

Jeong Ha-yeon fell silent. I was puzzled for a moment, but then I saw Shin Sang-yong adjust his glasses. It seemed he would take over from here.

“W-We owe a great deal to User Kim Su-hyeon. Y-You saved our lives, and… uh… well…”

Seeing Shin Sang-yong sweat profusely and stammer, Jeong Ha-yeon gave a bittersweet smile. I maintained a calm expression and spoke in a gentle tone.

“You can speak freely. And anyone would have done the same in that situation.”

“T-Thank you. Phew. I have a habit of stuttering when I’m nervous. It’s something I’ve had since birth, so it’s not easy to fix. Haha. And…”

Shin Sang-yong cleared his throat briefly.

“You might not know since you’re still in your zeroth year, but not everyone would act the same way. Some users might save your life but then make… uh… embarrassing demands in return. Or they’d consider any items obtained as their rightful spoils. It might sound strange, but that’s how it is in the Hall Plane. So, we’re truly grateful for what you did.”

Of course. The reason they were so thankful was that I didn’t say, “Be grateful I saved your life and get lost,” or worse, “Hmm, the girl’s pretty. Wake her up, boys. Let’s have some fun in exchange for sparing her.” I hadn’t done anything like that.

If I were still the person I was in my first cycle, or if I had been alone, I might have stripped them of everything they had and never given it back. That’s just how it works. If it weren’t for the kids watching, or if I hadn’t taken a liking to Jeong Ha-yeon and considered recruiting her, I might have left them behind out of annoyance, items and all.

I liked Shin Sang-yong too. If he had flaunted his second-year status over us zeroth-years, I would’ve been irritated. But he spoke cautiously, almost like an older brother gently teaching his younger sibling about the ways of the world. Recalling their dispositions as seen through my Third Eye, I waited for his next words.
