# Memorize - Chapter 66: Mage and Alchemist (Rare) (2)

An-hyeon was glaring at the spider with a face full of wariness. An-sol silently raised her staff, while Yu-jeong gripped her dagger tightly, exuding a chilling murderous aura. Their expressions suggested they were ready to charge at any moment.

In contrast, the human-faced spider, or rather Vivian, wore an air of relaxed confidence. With a soft smile, as if indulging a younger sibling’s tantrum, she soon let out a giggle and spoke again in a lively voice. Naturally, her words were directed at me.

“Laughing? You’re laughing! You think so too, don’t you, human male?”

“From your perspective, I suppose there’s some truth to that, spider female.”

“Yohohoho! Spider female, huh? Hahaha! That’s a riot, truly. You’re definitely different. I like it! It’s been a while, so I’ll be generous. I’ve decided I won’t kill you… hmm… you’ll be taken alive!”

Vivian’s expression was one of genuine magnanimity. She raised her front two legs, crossing them like arms, nodding thoughtfully in a way that grew funnier the longer I watched. The kids didn’t seem to find it amusing, though; I could hear them letting out exasperated sighs.

By my standards, she was quite an entertaining monster. With a faint smile, I spoke in a slightly playful tone.

“I’ve got a question. Since you’re feeling generous, care to indulge me a bit more?”

Catching the intent behind my words, Vivian widened her eyes and countered, “I’m listening. What is it? Want me to spare the others too?”

“Not that. On our way here, I saw the bodies of two users… Did you kill both of them?”

Without a hint of hesitation, the spider nodded immediately. “Yup, I did. Why do you ask?”

“Even if you’re an alchemist, don’t you need human bodies for experiments? I don’t get why you’d just leave them there to rot. Right, Vivian?”

“Ehh? Those were all torn to shreds… Wait, how did you know I’m Vivian the alchemist?”

After observing her reaction, I suppressed a creeping smile and maintained a calm facade. She was fairly spirited and possessed a degree of intelligence, but that was it. The sophisticated reasoning she might have had in her alchemist days seemed long gone. Having confirmed the reaction I wanted, I had no reason to hold back.

Vivian hopped excitedly, her face beaming with joy at being recognized. (As an aside, each hop made the ground shake, making me worry the dungeon might collapse.) Purely a guess, but Vivian likely tampered with body modification or infectious experiments out of a desire to live longer. This was a typical grim fate for mages or alchemists who weren’t skilled enough to become liches. If she was content with it, I had nothing to say, but it was a rare case nonetheless.

“Some human males and females did come in earlier. Lowly creatures, but a few of them had some skill. Thanks to them, I lost a ton of useful minions. You guys passed through the goblin clearing, right? That wasn’t originally their spot. The ones who were there got wiped out, so I had to fill it in a hurry… Ugh, it pisses me off!”

Vivian’s cheeks puffed out in genuine anger. She spewed venom from her mandibles to prove her fury, then steadied her breathing and continued in a high-pitched voice.

“Did I just stand by and watch? No way! I thought, ‘This won’t do,’ and stepped in myself. And let me tell you, it was a sight. The moment I showed myself, one guy just bolted! The one with the bow! He abandoned the others to save his own skin, and it ticked me off just watching him. Honestly, it did break the others’ fighting spirit, though.”

“And then?”

“Honestly, I wanted to kill that guy first, but the others didn’t leave me alone. Especially that male priest. I kinda liked him, but he kept yammering about his god, so I took him out first. He was trying to protect the others while escaping, so I stabbed a leg through him and cut him in half at the waist. Hmm, now that I think about it, I chased after that fleeing archer right after, so I didn’t check. Is he dead?”

Vivian rattled off the story at breakneck speed. She clearly loved to talk. The kids, seeing me converse so casually with her, were staring in stunned silence. Then I noticed An-hyeon suddenly shift to a serious expression, giving the others a subtle glance. He probably misunderstood my chatting as a stalling tactic to buy time for them to recover stamina. I was just genuinely curious, but…

Since the misunderstanding wasn’t harmful, I nodded slightly and answered her question.

“Yeah, he’s dead. So, the archer user got taken down by you too?”

“Heehee, talking like this after so long is so much fun! Yup, yup! Honestly, guys like that are trash even by my standards. So I chased him down to the end. I twisted and yanked his neck, and he was screaming his head off. I did good, right? Uhihihi!”

Vivian looked genuinely delighted. She closed her eyes, savoring the memory. Meanwhile, An-hyeon was calmly regulating his breathing. That kid always lost it when it came to Sol, but moments like this showed his potential. Push and pull, likable one moment, frustrating the next.

Vivian’s eyes sparkled as she raised a leg, pointing into the air with excitement. “Ask about that one too! I’m weirdly enjoying talking to you~ Heehee.”

“…Alright. What happened to the female user hanging from the ceiling?”

When I asked in a gentle tone, the spider twisted her body coyly, her cheeks flushing as she spoke. From behind, I heard Yu-jeong mutter, “That damn bitch…” under her breath. Yu-jeong, are you seriously jealous of a monster right now?

“Kyah! That female up there… ugh. From the moment I saw her, I couldn’t stand her. She looked down at me with those haughty eyes, so arrogant, it drove me nuts. And yet she ended up like that—so why act all high and mighty? So annoying, so annoying.”

“No matter how much you disliked her… that’s a bit much.”

As I spoke as if chatting with a friend, Vivian let out a chuckle and closed her eyes again, slipping back into her reminiscing mode. I’d had dozens of chances to strike already, but her storytelling was engaging, so I hadn’t attacked yet. Of course, while listening, I was starting to think about wrapping things up soon.

“Heehee. You’d have found it fun if you saw it! At first, she glared at me fiercely even when bound tight. I just wanted to break her. So I spun her around—gave her to Reng, to goblins, even to a Ramik disguised as that first runaway human. And finally, she served as a broodmare for the spiders to wrap it up neatly! That proud, composed face, crying and snotting, begging for forgiveness—it was hilarious. In the end, she lost her mind after getting pregnant and laying eggs. Heeheehee! Stupid girl. If she’d acted like that from the start, I might’ve spared her like the other males and females.”

“So there are still living users?”

“Yup. Wrapped up tight in cocoons, nicely stored. They’ll probably stay alive for a while. But I’m wondering what to do with them. Use them as fodder for the kids… or maybe turn them into chimeras? Hmm, the latter’s more tempting.”

By now, the kids’ breathing had stabilized significantly. Deciding it was time to end the conversation, I subtly raised my sword, which I’d lowered earlier. Seeing me take aim, Vivian muttered with a hint of disappointment, “Aww… you wanna fight? Let’s not bother with something so tedious, okay? I won’t treat you badly.”

“It is a hassle, but I think I need to take you down. My kids don’t seem to like you much either.”

“Hmph. Fine. If you insist on drinking poison, so be it. But I like you, so I won’t kill you. And… ugh, I’m being generous again. I’ll spare that cute male next to you too.”

An-hyeon’s face twisted strangely. But as the mood between me and An-hyeon shifted subtly, Yu-jeong and Sol’s anger only grew fiercer. Wiping a bead of sweat from my brow, I cleared my throat and continued, “What about the other two?”

“Hmm… Honestly, the priestess girl seems better suited as a host. Her mana looks abundant. But she seems too frail, and those types often kill themselves before they can be used as hosts. So I’ll go with the feisty-looking girl instead.”

“Crazy bitch.”

“Yup, I’m a crazy bitch.”

“You’re full of shit.”

“I don’t have a dick, though?”

“@#$%^&*&^%$#@!”

At Vivian’s flippant response, Yu-jeong let out a scream in some incomprehensible language. Vivian, who had been grinning through Yu-jeong’s torrent of curses, suddenly shifted to a deadly serious expression, radiating killing intent. Seeing the spider’s mood swing so drastically with each exchange, I let out a wry chuckle. She definitely wasn’t a spider with normal thought processes.

Yu-jeong, who had been spewing vitriol, clammed up the moment she felt Vivian’s aura change noticeably. Seeing the kids take on a serious demeanor, I slowly began to channel my mana. However, leaving it entirely to them felt like too much of a stretch. This time, even if it meant revealing my strength, I intended to step in. Just as I made up my mind and took a step forward, I saw Vivian’s mandibles open wide, and a torrent of silk poured out like a waterfall.

“Since I’m taking you, it’d be a shame to damage you. I’ll catch you all at once! Heeheehee!”

With Vivian’s laughter, gleaming silver threads shot out from her lower mandibles. Compared to the webs spun by the spiders we’d faced before, these were far thicker and came in an overwhelming volume. The threads poured toward the floor, spreading out like an open umbrella before curving toward us like arrows.

The speed was so fast that even I was momentarily caught off guard. The threads reached us in an instant, and the sticky silk began to wrap around our bodies. But I didn’t move, standing still as a single thought flashed through my mind. If there was no immediate threat to our lives, it might be better to let her take us to her secret lair and then escape from there.

“Surprised you, didn’t I? Heehee!”

I wasn’t resisting much, but the kids were fighting desperately. Even though I’d let my guard down, the speed was too much for me to react to. An-hyeon was belatedly swinging his spear to fend off the threads, but it was futile. The thickness and stickiness were bad enough, but the sheer volume was overwhelming. If An-hyeon was struggling, Yu-jeong and Sol had no chance either. Still, as the kids fought with all their might, Vivian let out a cheerful laugh and continued in a taunting tone.

“Uhihihi. It’s no use. My threads aren’t so weak that they’d break to mere weapons. Don’t underestimate my silk. Just accept it calmly, like the male in front. Your eyes, mouth, and ears might get blocked, but at least your nose will stay free.”

…Huh?

“Wait a sec. You’re saying everything but the nose gets blocked?”

“Uh? Yeah, yup.”

When I spoke with a brightened expression, Vivian’s eyes widened, and she stammered. After confirming her nod, I subtly turned my head. The threads were wrapping the kids so quickly that they already looked like cocoons adorned with silk.

Lowering my gaze, I saw the threads rapidly coiling around my body too. All senses blocked. That meant the kids in the cocoons wouldn’t be able to see or hear what I did. The thought struck me that if my secrecy was guaranteed, there was no need to go to her lair.

Having made up my mind, I immediately awakened the Hwa-jeong dormant within me.
