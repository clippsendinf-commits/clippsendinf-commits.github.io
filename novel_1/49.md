# 메모라이즈-48화 (48/1068) Dungeon Of Alchemist

"Oppa, what are you doing?"

Yujeong poked her head in, confirmed I was there, and slipped inside. Her voice carried a hint of dissatisfaction, sinking low. The sulky look on her face was, to my eyes, a signal she was about to be a nuisance again. I set down the record I was holding in my left hand, sighed, and opened my mouth.

"What's wrong now?"

My curt tone made Yujeong’s face droop instantly. Still, she pouted her lips and pressed on.

"You told Sol she could train differently and she keeps bragging about it. Flipping and catching coins all by herself… it’s not even showing off."

"What’s there to show off about? And is Sol the type to boast?"

"No, really! She keeps flipping and catching those coins…"

"She’s practicing a binding spell. I told her to do it."

Cutting off Yujeong’s words nonchalantly, I saw a flicker of hurt cross her face. As I moved to pick up the record again, her grumbling voice reached my ears once more.

"Oppa, that’s unfair. You told me and Hyeon to just focus on detection training."

"You do it because it’s necessary. For close-combat types, detection training is enough early on."

"Still…"

Despite my firm stance in the past, Yujeong dragged out her voice in a whiny protest. My already tangled thoughts felt even more jumbled.

"What’s with the ‘still’? Sol’s base magic power stat is higher than yours to begin with. For support types, that level of training is plenty. Besides, coin practice wouldn’t help you much."

Four days had passed, and the current record holder for the longest detection time was Ansol. Since I guided her, Sol had been making full use of her vast magic reserves. Even with the instructors’ teachings, she hadn’t progressed much, but after just one day of my guidance, her skills soared. She looked at me like I was some kind of god.

In my first cycle, I reached the Sword Master realm with just 48 magic points. When it comes to mana efficiency, I’m more confident than anyone. I’d passed some of that know-how to Sol. Since I knew how effective those techniques were, you could say I was favoring her a bit. 

Yujeong seemed quite upset about being overtaken by Sol. Whenever I returned to the inn, she’d frequently show up, pestering me for private lessons. Once or twice, I could humor her, but the constant repetition was exhausting.

"I just showed her a bit about controlling magic power. Anyway, go practice your detection training. Look at Sol—she’s working hard once she sets her mind to it."

"Tch. You always dote on Sol. And I’m taking a break, okay?"

Yujeong let out a frustrated huff, her expression sour, then shuffled over and plopped down right next to me. I shrugged and turned my gaze back to the map. She stared at my face for a moment before picking up a stray piece of paper nearby.

"Ancient… Alchemy… Revival and… End? Oppa, what’s this about?"

"Nothing much. Just toss it aside somewhere."

I was reading a record about ancient alchemy when I picked up a pen and circled a spot on the map. Yujeong glanced at the map, covered in circles, and spoke in a small voice.

"What are these? And what’s with all the circles on the map?"

"Records. Map analysis."

"Come on, Oppa. I’m curious about what you’ve been up to lately."

Frustrated by my short answers, Yujeong’s voice took on a pleading tone. Without taking my eyes off the map, I continued.

"I’m investigating records. Hunting monsters around the city isn’t efficient. I’m looking at old records about Mul to find clues about specific locations."

"Oh, I see… But can you really find clues like this?"

"It’d probably be easier to pluck a star from the sky."

My tone was bitter, but Yujeong giggled easily. I’d collected every record related to alchemists and laboratories, so the stack on the table was quite substantial.

Sometimes, when you have a bit of information, you review records to piece together more details. But digging through records blindly for clues was foolish. The sheer volume of records was overwhelming, and you couldn’t even be sure if they were factual. Following them blindly was a poor judgment call.

And yet, here I was, making that very foolish choice. That’s why I ignored all other records. I was only doing this because I was certain the alchemist’s dungeon was in Mul. Otherwise, I’d have headed straight to the Cave of Screams.

I spoke in a weary voice.

"If it was easy to find, it would’ve been uncovered ages ago. For now, I’m just doing what I can."

Yujeong’s eyes lit up with interest. When she offered to help, I accepted without hesitation. I could already predict what would happen in five minutes.

Sure enough, five minutes later, Yujeong started glancing at me nervously. Then, mentioning An-hyeon and Ansol, she used training as an excuse to slip away. With her temperament and patience, there was no way she could endure this tedious process.

I gave a wry smile at her retreat, then turned back to the map and records.

*

How many more days had passed? The once-clean map was now dense with circles. At a glance, it looked chaotic, but certain areas had clusters of circles. I couldn’t be sure until I checked them out, but I had a rough hunch.

With the analysis done, I sank into my chair. Glancing at the window, I saw the night had settled in, dark and quiet. Thinking of the kids, I activated my detection and heard steady breathing from the next room. They must have finished training and gone to sleep. Thinking of the progress they’d shown brought a faint smile to my face.

In just a week, the kids had reached the level I’d demanded with impressive dedication. Sometimes, I caught hints of their eagerness to leave the city, but thankfully, they followed my lead in prioritizing training.

The reason they listened to me was simple. They weren’t thoughtless. They jokingly said, “If we listen to Oppa (Hyung), we’ll get rewards even in our sleep.” They believed my decisions were always right because, from the Rite of Passage to the User Academy and now, following me had never led them astray.

This round of training had some grumbling, but the results were clear. Even though they only focused on detection, not only their magic but other stats had improved evenly. Seeing Hyeon excited about gaining 2 magic points in just eight days made me a little envious.

I’d joined the Academy for the 4-point mission reward, but despite training hard on stamina, I hadn’t gained a single point. It was hard not to feel disappointed.

My stat issues weren’t something I could solve right now, so I set the thought aside. It was about time to leave the city, but one final issue remained: the caravan composition.

Hunting monsters around the city was fine with any group setup. But for exploration or conquest, forming a balanced caravan was basic Hall Plane common sense. We had plenty of close-combat types, but a caravan needed archers (rangers) and priests.

Did we really need them right now, though? A priest was essential, but we already had Sol. A mage was optional, and as for a pathfinder archer, I could guide the kids myself. With my Third Eye and memories of operating in Mul, the chance of getting lost was near zero.

Still, if the kids got used to this setup, it could cause problems later. We’d surely face tougher expeditions in the future. Even if I could cover a lot now, I couldn’t babysit them forever. This first expedition was a chance for them to learn, and if they normalized this unbalanced composition, it could spell trouble.

*Knock, knock, knock.*

I was deep in thought about the caravan when a soft knock came at the door. Extending my detection, I sensed a woman’s presence outside. I raised my head and spoke quietly.

“Yes? Who is it?”

“It’s me. You already know it’s me, don’t you?”

“…”

Without waiting for my permission, the woman opened the door and stepped inside. Knowing her identity, I couldn’t see her as just the innkeeper. Honestly, I couldn’t fathom why a user of her caliber was in Mul right now.

This woman, who had briefly vanished from Mul, disappeared abruptly and reappeared just as suddenly. When she returned to the Hall Plane, she was an enemy of my clan.

I still remembered something she’d said back then.

*“Maybe, if I’d met her first, I would’ve joined her side immediately. She’s that captivating a user.”*

From that, I guessed she wasn’t aligned with any clan yet.

The Ragnarok Siege flashed through my mind. She’d been utterly defeated—executed, really—by the Princess of Execution, who was our ally. But the terrifying power she’d displayed was still etched in my memory.

She wore her usual languid smile. With slightly drooping eyes and a mole beneath them, she exuded a decadent charm. She spoke to me in a gentle tone.

“Hi. Mind if I come in?”

She was already inside, so what was the point of asking? I nodded with a wry expression.

“It’s late. What brings you here?”

She didn’t answer but slowly closed the distance between us. This woman could take my life in an instant if I let my guard down. I couldn’t relax, so I subtly began to channel my mana.

Her face still held that languid smile. Then, for a moment, I saw her eyes flicker with a grayish hue. Already on high alert, I reflexively activated my Third Eye.

*[Unique Ability: Lure Eyed detected.]*

*[Third Eye activated. Lure Eyed penetrated.]*

Well, well.

“Oh my… do you need to pick a time to charm a man you like?”

“…The kids are in the next room…”

She was toying with me. I’d faced this kind of attack countless times in the shadows, so I knew the playbook. Still, I deliberately let my eyes glaze over and flushed my face, playing along to see what she’d do.

“It’s fine… don’t worry about that. By the way, today’s the last day of your stay. What’s your plan?”

No one comes at night just to ask that. She must have another motive. That question was likely a test to see if I was under her spell. I answered casually, adding a hint of hesitation for effect.

“I’m planning to leave the city tomorrow morning…”

“Leave…?”

At my words, she glanced at the table. Her expression shifted subtly. She probably guessed what I was up to from the map, even with just a quick look.

“User Kim Su-hyeon.”

“How do you know my name…?”

She called my name and took another step closer. We were now close enough to touch if we reached out.

“The new user who just arrived. The super rookie of the User Academy.”

She took another step without stopping. I sat in my chair, and she stood directly in front of me, our eyes locked. Her gray-tinted eyes gazed at me.

“No matter how you slice it… you’re still a newbie who hasn’t even been here four months.”

Her hand reached out and gently cupped my face. I felt the soft touch of her fingers on my left cheek. I deliberately breathed heavily, panting slightly.

“That day… I was really shocked. Even though I used minimal mana, I never expected a fresh Academy graduate to break my spell.”

“That was…”

“So I looked into you and kept an eye on you… but I still don’t get it. You’re hard to pin down. This is a first for me, and it’s confusing. The more I see you, the more my instincts scream that there’s something different about you. Something you’re hiding.”

Is that so?

Convinced I was fully charmed, her movements grew bolder. As her hand, which had been softly tracing my face, began to pull away, I quickly grabbed it. Seeing my reaction, her smile deepened.

“My instincts are never wrong.”

I leaned into her embrace, like a child seeking their mother’s arms. Honestly, in my first cycle, I’d wanted to be held by her just once. Whether she knew my ulterior motives or not, she looked satisfied as she pulled me close. I buried my face in her chest, savoring the moment.

“Ho ho.”

I relished the soft, pliant feel of her chest and the fragrant scent of her skin. She smiled serenely, stroking my hair. After a while, her hand paused, and her sultry voice whispered in my ear.

“Are you hiding something? Maybe from the kids…?”

“A little…”

“Then why don’t you share it with just me…?”

“That’s…”

As I showed a faint sign of resistance, she hugged me tighter and spoke in a soothing tone.

“It’s okay… just tell me.”

At her coaxing, I slowly opened my eyes. Pretending to hesitate, I spoke quietly, as if giving in.

“Actually… I…”

“Yes? You?”

Looking at her expectant face, I spoke calmly.

“I like shadows.”

“…What?”

I glanced at her shadow cast on the floor. It entered my vision clearly. At her question, I smiled faintly and answered.

“Your shadow is really pretty.”

As I finished speaking and looked up, I saw her face frozen in an almost terrifying expression.
