# Memorize - Chapter 146: MenTal IllNess

“Save… me, please.”

As I approached the female User who had collapsed to her knees, her first words to me were a plea for mercy. I gazed down at her with cold, impassive eyes for a moment. Then, with my sword dangling loosely at my side, I slowly crouched to meet her gaze at eye level. She flinched, shrinking back further as our eyes locked. Looking at the terrified archer User, I spoke in a calm, measured tone.

“Do you want to live?”

“Yes…” 

Her faint nod was accompanied by a voice that seemed to carry a desperate yearning for survival. I had intended to spare one of them from the start—not out of mercy, but because I had questions about the vagrants’ behavior. With that in mind, I offered a faint smile and continued slowly.

“I have a few things I’d like to ask. Will you answer?”

“What kind of… I’ll answer everything.”

“Good. Smart girl. Let’s start. How are vagrants like you here, in this place? And why go through all this trouble instead of attacking us outright?”

“That’s…”

I saw An So-yeon’s throat bob as she swallowed hard. Licking her lips nervously, she began to answer in a trembling voice, one detail at a time.

“Hmm.”

After hearing her responses, I paused to think. She didn’t seem to be lying.

First, they weren’t full-fledged vagrants. To be precise, they were opportunists straddling the line between User and vagrant. They usually posed as ordinary Users but turned to vagrant tactics when it suited them. They hadn’t been put on any wanted lists yet, which, generously speaking, showed their cunning. Less generously, they were utterly despicable.

Her answer to my second question was even more telling. They had been watching us for far longer than I’d expected. They knew we were Year 0 Users and had even learned that we’d recently graduated from the User Academy. They’d observed us upgrading our equipment after a few caravan expeditions and decided to make their move.

“We thought… maybe you had some ability or method for succeeding in caravan expeditions. So we sent Sister Ju-hyeon to…”

“So, if I’d had some expedition-related ability, you’d have killed everyone except me?”

“…”

An So-yeon averted her gaze, letting her silence speak for her. I let out a heavy sigh and stood up. She looked up at me again, her expression pleading.

“Then… will you let me live?”

I paused, pretending to consider. How should I kill her? I’d never intended to let her live. Then, a good idea struck me, and I nodded to myself. Pointing in a specific direction, I spoke.

“You answered honestly, so I’ll give you a chance. Drop your weapon and run that way. You’d better run like your life depends on it. Because if you don’t…”

I deliberately trailed off, and a flicker of hope sparked in An So-yeon’s eyes. Her movements were swift—she clearly knew instinctively what she needed to do to survive. The moment I gave her a glimmer of hope, she sprang to her feet, fearing I might change my mind. As instructed, she carefully placed her weapon on the ground and, with trembling legs, started moving in the direction I’d pointed.

She glanced back at me nervously as she went, but seeing me still standing there, she quickened her pace to a jog. As she slipped into the dark underbrush, I pulled a cigarette from my pocket and lit it. I’d give her until I finished this one before following.

*Chik. Chiiiik.*

*Kyaa! Kyaaaa!*

No need to follow after all. As the cigarette’s tip burned, a faint scream echoed from somewhere ahead. After a couple of puffs, a shadowy figure emerged from the underbrush into the clearing. In one hand, they held a severed head by its hair before casually dropping it to the ground. A glance revealed An So-yeon’s neatly severed neck. I let out a wry chuckle and took another satisfying drag. So, she didn’t make it. Not that I’d planned to let her live anyway.

“Seriously? You did that on purpose, didn’t you? Telling me to kill her?”

When I didn’t respond, a grumbling voice cut through the air. It was Go Yeon-ju. I shrugged lightly at her question and closed my eyes. My head felt pleasantly dizzy, a refreshing clarity washing away the stifling weight that had been pressing on me. All that remained was the satisfaction of dealing with the vagrants.

Savoring the moment, I spoke in a cheerful tone.

“I left one for you, didn’t I? You should at least get a taste.”

“What’s that supposed to mean? You really went all out, huh? I didn’t expect you to go *this* far.”

She brushed off my comment and sighed, glancing around. Following her gaze, I saw the vagrants’ bodies strewn across the ground. The highlight was undoubtedly the mage User, limbs severed and an arrow lodged in their neck. Go Yeon-ju’s eyes lingered there for a while. An awkward silence settled, but she soon broke it with a bright smile.

“Did you *have* to go that far? That girl looked so young. I mean, yeah, I killed her, but it felt like you were telling me to do it.”

“Close enough. For the record, one of my principles is this: *No compromise with vagrants, no matter what.* If you hadn’t killed her, I would’ve done it myself.”

“Fair point, I suppose. But the way you act with the kids normally and *this* side of you—it’s such a contrast.”

I let out a small laugh at her words and spoke softly.

“Ha. Disappointed?”

Go Yeon-ju fell silent for a moment. She studied me with a subtle expression, her eyes locked on mine. I met her gaze calmly, pulling the cigarette from my mouth and flicking ash off the tip.

Then, a deep smile spread across her lips, and they parted slowly.

The next morning, I ordered the group to break camp and quietly studied the map. In two or three days, we’d reach the *Screaming Cave* point. Humming to myself as I traced the route, I sensed someone approaching.

“Su-hyeon, something good happen?”

“Hm? Oh, Ha-yeon. What do you mean, something good?”

It was Jeong Ha-yeon. With her usual bright expression, she lightly linked her arm with mine (more like gently holding my elbow). She studied my face for a moment before speaking in a curious tone, giving my arm a couple of squeezes.

“You look relaxed today, almost carefree. Like when I first met you.”

“Haha. Did I seem different before?”

“Yes. I debated saying something. Since we started this expedition, you’ve seemed… stifled, a bit anxious or uneasy.”

I kept a calm expression, but inwardly, I flinched. Lately, I’d noticed women seemed to have a radar for reading men’s emotions. How did she pick up on it so accurately? Maybe some of the group knew Ha-yeon and I had slept together, shared that intimacy. At least one person might. A cold sweat threatened to break out as the thought hit me, but Vivian’s grumbling voice interrupted.

“Ugh! What’s with this bag? It’s so heavy!”

“…”

“Ow, damn it. Weird. It was light yesterday.”

Vivian kept muttering as she adjusted her backpack. Go Yeon-ju glanced at me with a subtle smile. There was no need to leave the vagrants’ bodies untouched after last night’s fight. Some of them had decent gear, so we stripped everything that wasn’t damaged and stuffed it into Vivian’s bag.

Yesterday—or rather, early this morning—I thought about An So-yeon. Normally, she’d be a high schooler back in the modern world, living out her youth. That’s what people might think, but I felt nothing of the sort. I only weighed her stats, abilities, and whether she’d survive. Honestly, it’s a shame. Her stats aside, she had a Unique Ability and other skills tailored for an archer. Her tracking skills looked decent, too, and we currently lacked an archer in our caravan.

But I chose to kill her. I deliberately sent her toward where Go Yeon-ju was hiding, certain she’d take care of it. Even if she hadn’t, I’d have followed and done it myself. If she hadn’t been a vagrant, I might’ve considered recruiting her.

That didn’t matter anymore, so I pushed the thought aside and returned to the map. I didn’t forget to add a word to Ha-yeon.

“I was feeling a bit stifled lately, but it’s resolved now. No need to worry.”

“Oh, but what if I *want* to worry?”

“Hmm. Then maybe you could offer me a lap pillow later.”

“Ho ho, naughty.”

“Huh? I just meant a lap pillow. What’s naughty about that?”

“Oh? Would you say that if you were thinking about the lap pillow from the lab?”

Ha-yeon poked my side playfully, giving me a teasing look. Speechless, I buried myself in the map, but I could tell she was beaming with a radiant smile. She usually kept a cool, composed demeanor, but seeing her show such a warm smile just for me stirred a strange mix of emotions—relief, yet a lingering heaviness. It was a contradictory, indescribable feeling, one that didn’t feel like it belonged to me.

“Oppa! We’ve finished breaking camp!”

“Hey, I said I’d tell him! You little pipsqueak, stealing my thunder!”

“Eek! First come, first served!”

“Ugh, you’re impossible. Take that!”

Seeing An-sol’s cheeks being stretched by Yu-jeong, who was flailing her arms, I let out a sigh. Folding the map, I calmly ordered the group to line up. The kids didn’t know about last night’s battle with the vagrants. They’d slept soundly through it all, and I had no intention of telling them about the tail we’d picked up.

The angels’ Rite of Passage might be over, but my own wasn’t. All that remained was reaching the *Screaming Cave*, likely our final test.

---

Before crossing the last mountain ridge, we encountered a group of monsters. They had multiple horns on their heads, ostrich-like bodies, and strong leg muscles—Ladolrofs. On their own, Ladolrofs weren’t particularly troublesome. But in this mountainous terrain, their pack behavior and high mobility made them formidable.

The Ladolrofs before us checked all those boxes. In my first cycle, some Users tried taming them for mounts, but their wariness of humans made it nearly impossible. These ones were already on high alert, eyeing us cautiously.

Their horns ranged from one to four, with fewer indicating younger, less mature Ladolrofs. A single-horned one stood at the center, surrounded by others with three or four horns. This was an unavoidable fight—and one I had no intention of avoiding. I raised my hand to signal combat preparations.

“Ladolrofs. They likely see us as intruders in their territory. There are young ones, so they’ll be fiercer than usual. If they charge and ram with their horns, the impact could be severe, so stay sharp. We’ll stick to a defensive formation this time. No one moves forward recklessly.”

That last bit was aimed at Yu-jeong. At my command, the sound of weapons being drawn filled the air. I added one more order for Ha-yeon.

“Ha-yeon, can you use rapid-fire spear-type magic?”

She tilted her head, then answered readily.

“Rapid-fire? It’s a high-level technique, but I can manage. It’s usually for one-shot kills, though—great power, but it’s taxing on stamina and mana.”

“Don’t overdo it. Just cast what you’re most confident with.”

She nodded, beginning her incantation while forming a hand sign. A blue glow emanated from her staff, and her necklace sparkled—she was clearly preparing something big.

No need to go *that* far, I thought.
