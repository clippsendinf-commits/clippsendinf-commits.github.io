# Memorize - Chapter 51 (51/1068): My Oppa (Big Brother) Has Changed

Stupid. Hyeon and Yujeong weren’t considering the formation centered around Sol at all. It was a good thing I’d kept a Keeper on standby, just in case. I shot Yujeong a sharp glare before striking the tail slashing diagonally toward me with the flat of my sword.

The phenomenon that followed left me momentarily stunned. I’d put some force into hitting the tail, but my intent was merely to redirect its attack path—a defensive move. Yet, the tail, upon meeting my blade, shattered with a sound like bursting scales. As the pitiful cry of the ambushing monster echoed, I snapped back to reality.

It was likely the rank effect of my Sword Specialist class or some unique or latent ability kicking in. A flurry of thoughts crossed my mind, but I needed to focus on the battle. Infusing my voice with mana, I called out to everyone.

“These are Black Scorpions. Their tail stingers carry deadly venom, so be extremely careful. Their weak points are the eyes or belly, but they’re hard to expose. Infuse your weapons with mana and strike hard.”

As I finished speaking and lowered my head, I saw Sol, still dazed, her mouth agape. She seemed shaken, likely realizing she could’ve died moments ago. I found it pathetic but quickly barked at her.

“Ansol! We’re in the middle of a fight! What are you doing stopping your chants as a priest?”

“Ah…”

At my words, Sol, as if chilled to the bone, began muttering her incantations again. I let out a sigh and turned my attention forward.

The battle had momentarily lulled. Black Scorpions often moved in pairs, and they shared a deep bond. When the cry of the scorpion whose tail I’d shattered rang out, the one Hyeon was facing flinched, momentarily freezing.

But that lasted only a moment. A furious roar erupted as the scorpions began exuding an even more ferocious aura. As they advanced, growling, their forms emerged from the darkness. Seeing their tiger-sized bodies, the kids’ faces turned pale.

We’d been caught off-guard by their initial ambush, but we’d managed to prepare somewhat. Now, the Black Scorpions were approaching slowly. Both sides were sizing each other up, making it hard to predict who’d strike first.

From our earlier exchange, maintaining the formation seemed pointless. After assessing the battlefield, I decided to take the initiative and spoke up.

“I’ll pair with Yujeong, and Hyeon, you pair with Sol. Each pair takes one scorpion. Sol, use your spells to bind the scorpion’s tail. Hyeon, seize that moment to channel mana to the tip of your spear and thrust it into the body. Their armor is tough, so don’t try to slash—aim to pierce. Yujeong, stay behind me. I’ll go in first and kick to expose its belly. Wait for the tail attack to pass, then move in for a counterstrike.”

No one answered, but I saw them nod. Meanwhile, the scorpions were inching closer. The moment they entered my detection range and I stepped forward, the battle resumed.

Part of the venomous tail lay twitching on the ground, but the scorpion’s remaining tail still posed a lethal threat. Seeing it raise its tail again, I charged forward.

A sharp whistle cut through the air as the tail, oozing dark blue blood, lunged toward my face. Its attack was linear, making it easy to dodge. I stepped to the side, and the tail sliced through empty air, missing its mark.

In that moment, I closed the distance enough to engage the scorpion. Sensing Yujeong moving behind me, I lowered my sword deliberately. And then, I caught it—the Black Scorpion seemed to smirk.

“Oppa! Behind you!”

A chill ran down my neck. The Black Scorpion’s tail was long and flexible. While its initial strike was straight, it could bend mid-attack to redirect its assault. It must’ve curved its tail into a U-shape to target my head after I dodged. Smirking back at the scorpion, I sprinted closer, nearly closing the gap entirely.

Just as the tail was about to strike my head, Yujeong’s scream rang out. In that split second, I tilted my head to the right. The tail grazed my cheek, missing by a hair’s breadth. At the same time, I raised my lowered sword, lightly touching the passing tail and applying subtle force to redirect it—toward the scorpion’s own eye.

It never could’ve anticipated I’d dodge at such close range, nor that I’d adjust its tail’s trajectory with my sword. The sword technique I used was almost acrobatic. While rooted in orthodox Taiji principles, it could be adapted for incredible versatility depending on the user. It was a technique you could only imagine in your head, rarely executable in real combat.

The result was immediate. The scorpion’s own tail stabbed cleanly into its right eye.

“Kreeeeee!”

As it wailed, I flashed a triumphant smile. Pulling my right leg back, I delivered a powerful kick to its face. The impact reverberated through my foot as the scorpion’s body lifted into the air. With its pincers spread wide, it looked absurdly like it was cheering toward the sky. Seeing its exposed belly, I shouted.

“Now!”

It wasn’t the perfect counter timing, but Yujeong, somewhat prepared, dove in a beat late. She stomped forward, leaping up and crossing her daggers in an X-shape, slashing into the scorpion’s belly like a flash of light. It wasn’t flawless, but the coordinated attack was a success.

Watching the screeching Black Scorpion, I gripped Yujeong’s shoulder and leaped into the air. Raising my swords high, I brought them down with full force, cleaving through the center of the scorpion’s airborne body. I hadn’t infused mana, relying solely on physical strength, yet my blade sliced through its tough shell as smoothly as cutting tofu. In less than ten seconds, we’d perfectly dispatched one scorpion.

But one remained. Turning quickly, I saw Sol completing her incantation, thrusting her glowing white staff forward. Aiming at the tail as I’d instructed, she shouted.

“Shackles!”

A blinding flash, like a camera burst, filled the forest. It was an immense amount of mana for a novice user. Hyeon, reflexively closing his eyes, opened them to see the tail aimed at him frozen in place, his eyes gleaming.

“Haa!”

With a spirited shout, Hyeon thrust his spear, striking the Black Scorpion’s body dead-on. With its tail immobilized, the scorpion raised its massive pincers, but the spear’s reach was longer. The spear pierced through the tough shell, shattering it. Yet, the scorpion only growled lowly, seemingly unaffected. While Hyeon had broken the outer shell, the strike hadn’t penetrated deep enough to deal significant internal damage.

Hyeon, flustered, pulled back his spear and thrust repeatedly, but the scorpion’s tail, now freed from the binding, forced him to retreat. As the tail whipped flexibly, pressuring him, Hyeon’s movements grew erratic, eventually reducing him to desperate defense.

“What… what’s wrong with him? Why’s he struggling so much?” Yujeong muttered, bewildered.

I frowned as Sol hesitated, merely watching. Were they here to spectate? Stifling my frustration, I shouted as I charged forward.

“Are you guys here to watch a show? Stop standing around and help!”

Only then did Yujeong and Sol snap to attention. Hyeon was holding his own, dodging the scorpion’s tail attacks and occasionally parrying its pincers. But that was all—focused entirely on defense, he couldn’t muster an offense.

I realized my mistake. I’d assumed they’d perform well based on their stats alone. In a life-or-death melee like this, true ability shone through, and judging them solely by stats had led to this outcome. The kids weren’t utilizing their abilities at all. While my expectations were high, they still had a long way to go. If it weren’t for my detection training, things could’ve gone south much earlier.

Only two scorpions had attacked, and Yujeong and I had handled one. They could focus on the remaining one, barely maintaining the situation. But if we’d been swarmed by double the number, it would’ve been dire. Their gear was already subpar from prioritizing weapons; struggling this much against one scorpion didn’t bode well for worse scenarios. I swatted away the tail aiming for Hyeon’s back, giving him room to focus forward.

“Ansol! Bind it again!”

“Yes! Shackles!”

As soon as I spoke, Sol chanted the incantation as if she’d been waiting. Another flash filled the forest, and the scorpion’s tail froze again. Hyeon, frustrated at being limited to defense, had a flushed face. The moment Sol’s binding took effect, he stomped forward, charging aggressively.

“You bastard!”

With a coarse curse, Hyeon thrust his spear powerfully, then, as if one strike wasn’t enough, began jabbing wildly. His spear, infused with maximum mana, tore through the air, piercing the scorpion’s shell once per second. This time, the attacks had impact. Even a Black Scorpion couldn’t withstand such relentless strikes, letting out a mournful cry and shielding itself with its pincers.

“Huff! Huff!”

Despite his all-out assault, the scorpion only retreated a few steps. Its shell was tattered, but Hyeon was exhausted too. I sighed, stepping forward to kick its belly again, when—

“Hyeon! Move!”

Yujeong, who’d been watching, suddenly sprinted forward, her daggers humming with mana.

Seeing Yujeong charge, the scorpion raised its pincers high, and its tail twitched, signaling the binding was about to break. But Sol didn’t stand idle, chanting another spell.

“Unni! Protect!”

As Sol finished, a translucent barrier formed around Yujeong. Hyeon, not content to stand by, resumed wielding his spear to support her. Their coordination was finally coming together, though it still felt chaotic.

Together, Hyeon and Yujeong unleashed a barrage, and the Black Scorpion, barely holding on, collapsed. Its corpse was gruesome—shell shattered, innards exposed, black blood pooling everywhere. I was momentarily speechless; I hadn’t expected them to take down a Black Scorpion so brutally.

Compared to their mangled corpse, Hyeon and Sol looked at the relatively cleaner remains of the other scorpion and sheathed their weapons. Panting heavily, Hyeon and Yujeong stared at the corpse in disbelief.

The difficulty, incomparable to the Rite of Passage, had overwhelmed them from the start. Biting their lips, they glanced at me. If they had any sense, they’d know how poorly they’d performed.

“You guys…”

I opened my mouth to say something but closed it. Was I expecting too much, or was this normal for them? I couldn’t tell. What had they even learned at the User Academy? It was so different from my novice days. Honestly, I wanted to drag them back to the city and start their training from scratch.

“Hyung…”

“Oppa…”

Seeing the blatant disappointment on my face, they fidgeted, but I deliberately turned my back, ignoring them. The thought that they had a long way to go only drew another sigh.

I slammed my sword into the ground. The blood on the blade sprayed in a crescent arc, splattering across the earth.
