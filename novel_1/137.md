# Chapter 136: A Meaningful Conclusion

Even by lunchtime, Yu-jeong didn’t show up. The only sign of her was the occasional thudding noise from the first floor. I was curious about what kind of training was happening inside, but I had no choice but to hold back my questions.

Go Yeon-ju reappeared around midday. It seemed she planned to continue her usual tasks while also training Yu-jeong. However, she no longer joined us for meals. When An-hyeon invited her to eat, she smiled and said, “I’m keeping the kid hungry, so I’m not eating either.”

I had declared that Yu-jeong’s training was entirely entrusted to Go Yeon-ju. The others seemed just as curious, but since I told them to stay quiet and wait, they didn’t ask further. Go Yeon-ju responded to me with a bright smile before heading straight to the kitchen. Even by evening, Yu-jeong still hadn’t emerged.

Yu-jeong finally left Go Yeon-ju’s room when dusk settled over the *Modest Lady* inn. A commotion broke out downstairs, so I went to check. There, I saw An-hyeon, An-sol, and Vivian surrounding someone.

As I approached, I noticed An-sol, staff in hand, chanting a healing spell. At her feet lay Yu-jeong, collapsed on the floor.

Yu-jeong’s condition was pitiful. It was a wonder she wasn’t bleeding. Her body was covered in dark bruises, and her clothes and skin were drenched, clinging to her. It wasn’t just sweat—likely, she’d been doused with water multiple times. This suggested she’d passed out during training.

The others fretted, saying things like, “She’ll die like this!” or “This is too harsh!” But I brushed off their concerns, simply instructing them to heal her and take her to her room. I thought experiencing something like this once wouldn’t hurt. At the same time, I could guess Go Yeon-ju’s intentions.

Our approaches to training the group were polar opposites. Even considering the harsh reality of the *Hall Plane*, neither of us could be called entirely normal. Still, despite there being no strict need for such intensity, Go Yeon-ju had chosen to play the villain. It wasn’t just about teaching techniques—she seemed determined to overhaul Yu-jeong’s mindset entirely. I felt both grateful and apologetic toward her for doing what was truly necessary.

But the one who surprised me most was Yu-jeong herself. As An-sol bombarded her with healing spells, Yu-jeong’s eyes fluttered open. Her first words upon waking were, “I’m hungry.” An-hyeon, stunned, hurriedly ran downstairs to fetch food. Groaning, Yu-jeong stood up, her face swollen, and shuffled toward her room.

I didn’t ask if she was okay, and Yu-jeong didn’t whine about how tough it was. All that remained was an expression of exhaustion mixed with determination. An-sol, perhaps feeling sorry for her unsteady steps, supported her from the side.

“Unni, are you okay?” An-sol asked.

“Do I *look* okay?” Yu-jeong replied.

“No…”

“Ugh… I might actually die from now on. So, you—be ready anywhere, anytime. Cast healing spells to keep me alive.”

Yu-jeong lightly flicked An-sol’s forehead with her finger and said no more. Watching her, I turned away. Her resolve and awareness of death were more than I’d expected.

With that, the turmoil surrounding Go Yeon-ju’s addition to our group settled, and the caravan began moving forward again. I hadn’t been idle either. I couldn’t dwell on unresolved issues, so I focused on other matters.

Training was like daily life for me. Unless I was unconscious or something unavoidable came up, I made time to meditate at least once a day. My physical stats had already reached their limits—further improvement through training was nearly impossible. It wasn’t entirely out of the question, but raising even a single point would take an unimaginable amount of time.

I wrestled daily with how to use my remaining ability points or stat points. Especially with stats, I was still undecided. Should I invest everything in stamina to stabilize my current strength, or aim for 101 in other stats to reach a higher realm? I might gain a few more stat points in the future, but they’d likely total only three or four at most. That made me even more cautious. For now, I decided to save them, as I didn’t know when or which stat I’d need. My current stats were more than sufficient anyway.

As for exploration, I revisited the route to the *Screaming Cave* but didn’t uncover anything new. I pored over other records just in case, but finding an undiscovered location in the *Hall Plane*—a place with countless variables—after ten years was unrealistic. So, I set those matters aside. Time was ticking, and for now, the *Screaming Cave* was enough.

I also resolved the issue of equipment. I ended up withdrawing another 1,000 gold from the user shop, bringing our caravan’s funds to over 2,300 gold. However, I had to reserve some for clan registration, so I couldn’t spend it all.

Still, I needed to show Go Yeon-ju a decent amount of funding. This time, I deliberately targeted Yu-jeong for investment. Strictly speaking, her current gear was the weakest. Just as I’d heavily invested in An-hyeon before, I planned to do the same for Yu-jeong now, pushing her growth while she was gaining momentum. As a melee fighter, she needed sturdy armor, but her class also demanded mobility—a paradoxical requirement.

Yu-jeong was a close-range damage dealer. Wielding daggers meant getting close to monsters was inevitable, and as a mercenary, she needed to specialize in chaotic close-quarters combat.

I stripped her of all her old gear. First, I bought a light beige shirt, which, even compared to all the equipment I’d purchased before, was the most expensive. It cost 520 gold alone.

I got it from a novice user in Mul’s plaza, who seemed to have taken it from a fallen comrade. Their caravan had been wiped out, and they were looking to join a new one. After checking the seller’s stats, I decided against recruiting them—their abilities explained why no other caravan had taken them in. With no money, they were selling gear to raise funds. The moment I saw the shirt, I bought it on impulse. It was over 500 gold, but it was worth more than that.

There are several ways to enhance armor’s magical properties, mainly divided into two methods: applying potions or using magical effects. Magical effects, being permanent, are more expensive and effective. The shirt I bought had magical effects for physical defense. It was woven from ogre sinew processed with magic, making it incredibly tough. It was treated with both magic and potions to resist most attacks without tearing. The novice user also mentioned a slight resistance to all types of magic, which I confirmed with my *Third Eye*. The effect was minimal, but it existed.

Additionally, the shirt had a basic function to enhance mana activation and slightly lighten the wearer’s body. It was further treated with costly potions to maximize flexibility. For Yu-jeong, who valued both defense and mobility, it was perfect.

As a final touch, it had an auto-repair function, making it far too extravagant for a novice user. Spending nearly a quarter of our gold felt steep, but equipment of this quality would typically cost at least 700 gold, so I snapped it up.

The rest of her gear wasn’t as impressive as the shirt but was still far better than anything she’d worn before: a pair of leather pants (treated with physical defense and flexibility potions), a pair of leather long boots, a leather jacket (also treated with physical defense and flexibility potions), and a women’s belt for holding daggers.

At Go Yeon-ju’s request, I also changed one of Yu-jeong’s weapons. She used to wield twin daggers, but now one would be *Skrep*, a magic sword, and the other a curved dagger resembling a katana but with a narrower blade and slightly longer length. It was too short to call a longsword but too long for a typical dagger—an ambiguous curved blade.

Since it seemed Go Yeon-ju was teaching her proper dual-wielding, I ordered the custom blade without complaint. I also requested magical treatment to enhance its cutting power. This piece would’ve cost over 300 gold, but by trading in her old chainmail and two daggers, I negotiated it down to 207 gold.

I spent nearly 1,000 gold on Yu-jeong alone, but I didn’t regret a single coin. We still had funds to spare, and the *Screaming Cave* would soon bring in more. Even after leaving Mul for a regular or major city, clearing remaining dungeons would easily cover 1,000 gold and then some.

The day I finished buying her gear, Yu-jeong ended her training late at night. After receiving healing spells from Sol, she limped over, and I brought her to my room. As I dressed her in the new equipment, she looked noticeably different. The faint reddish tint of her hair paired perfectly with the slightly tight but well-fitted gear. She looked like a seasoned user. With two daggers strapped to her belt, she gazed at herself in the mirror before turning to me with a melancholic expression.

Seeing her face, I tilted my head. She used to jump with joy when I bought her gear, but now her attitude was completely different. Wondering what was wrong, I looked at her quietly. She spoke in a cautious voice.

“…Oppa.”

“Yeah?”

“Can you… hug me just once?”

“Come here.”

A flurry of thoughts crossed my mind, but I hugged her without a word. Yu-jeong nestled into my arms, her face showing a hint of relief as she rubbed her cheek against me. Then, she pulled away on her own. Though her face held lingering reluctance, she seemed to hold it back. She said, “Oppa, thanks for the gear. I’ll work really hard,” and left the room abruptly.

Later, I learned that Go Yeon-ju had told Yu-jeong I was focusing on buying her gear. She’d also said that this was her last chance—that if she didn’t exceed expectations in the next expedition, she might be left behind.

I had no intention of abandoning her as long as she tried, but I didn’t clarify anything. In the *Hall Plane*, weaker users get weeded out—that’s the reality. And after that day, I heard Yu-jeong was training even harder.

An-hyeon didn’t say anything when he saw me buying gear for Yu-jeong. His own armor was slightly lacking, but as he was training in the martial arts of a *Ki-Gong Spearmaster*, we decided to hold off on armor for now. His *Glove of Reduction* alone was worth almost as much as all of Yu-jeong’s gear combined.

Back at the *Ruined Laboratory*, Yu-jeong had received the least rewards, so this eased my mind a bit.

As for other matters, I occasionally asked Vivian about Shin Sang-yong’s progress. Each time, she deferred her answer, saying he was a good person but needed more observation. It seemed the contract we’d drawn up was having an effect. Recognizing the value I placed on rare classes, she was being more cautious than ever.

The group’s skills were improving by the day, and the caravan was becoming more stable. An-hyeon returned to basics, training diligently, seeming to have taken my warning to heart. An-sol no longer lagged behind.

Shin Sang-yong and Ha-yeon were both doing well. Ha-yeon, in particular, worked so hard I had to tell her to rest, but she’d reply, “If you rest, I’ll rest,” shutting me up.

Unlike the early days when I had to guide everyone step-by-step, the caravan was starting to find its footing, which warmed my heart. The clan I envisioned was slowly taking shape. If Go Yeon-ju’s recruitment was finalized after the *Screaming Cave* expedition, the first step would be perfectly complete. Hoping she’d join our clan, I slowly climbed into bed.

The sky was gradually brightening—morning was coming. Thinking I could sleep for at least an hour, I gently closed my eyes.
