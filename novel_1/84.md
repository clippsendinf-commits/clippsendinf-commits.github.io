# Chapter 83: One Fell Swoop (一瀉千里)

“I think Shin Sang-yong’s proposal is a bit difficult to accept.”

Shin Sang-yong’s face showed he had anticipated this response. However, the kids were all staring at me with wide eyes. Accepting such a proposal outright was something only novice users would do. I knew they weren’t that naive, but I wasn’t about to create an opening for us to be underestimated.

“We currently have a single goal. Making Vivian, a valuable talent, serve as Shin Sang-yong’s advisor could significantly hinder our ability to achieve that goal.”

“Of course. I understand. I didn’t intend to make such a request out of the blue.”

I gazed at Shin Sang-yong with steady eyes.

“This expedition’s failure has left me with nothing. Sure, I can still get by for now, but that’s it. More than anything, I keenly feel I’ve reached my limit. I was lucky to survive this time, but relying on such luck moving forward seems unlikely. So… I’d like to join your party, Kim Su-hyeon.”

Beside me, I saw Jeong Ha-yeon let out a sigh. Shin Sang-yong was undeniably a pure-hearted person. But as the conversation turned to the critical point, it was clear he didn’t know how to sugarcoat his words. To put it kindly, he was sincere; to put it harshly, he was the type easily taken advantage of.

When I didn’t respond, he hurriedly added, “I may not look like much, but I pride myself on being useful among users of my year. My mastery of orthodox magic alone should be helpful. At the very least, I won’t be a burden. And…”

He hesitated, then continued in a resolute tone, as if he’d made up his mind. “While traveling with your party, I won’t seek any personal gain. I’ll be content with receiving occasional guidance from Vivian. In return—though it’s not quite the right phrase—I’ll spare no effort to help your party achieve its goals.”

He had nothing to offer now but was staking his future on his current abilities. A sudden thought struck me about the *Chimera Alchemist* book. A jolt like lightning ran through my mind, and I turned my gaze to Vivian.

“Vivian.”

“I’ll do whatever you tell me, Su-hyeon.”

Her immediate response was commendable, but that wasn’t what I meant to ask. I was about to inquire about the minimum requirements for becoming a Chimera Alchemist but decided to hold my tongue.

The *Circle of Harmony* was undoubtedly a remarkable unique ability. If used well, it seemed highly compatible with the Chimera Alchemist class. This was just my speculation, but Shin Sang-yong might be able to generate a new special ability if he became a Chimera Alchemist.

I’d heard that, in rare cases, abilities could evolve when advancing to a Secret or Rare class. It was a slightly different situation, but each class required specific special or potential abilities. Ordinary users could acquire one special ability and four potential abilities. Those with a unique ability lost one potential ability slot. I, despite having a unique ability, had preserved one special and four potential abilities thanks to an achievement reward.

However, there were cases like this: for example, to become a Spirit Summoner, one must master summoning techniques. If all special, potential, and unique ability slots were already filled, the class would be incomplete. Shin Sang-yong’s situation was different. For some reason, his special ability had evolved into a unique ability.

If he unlocked one potential ability and advanced to a Rare class, there was a slim chance he could generate a new special ability. It was a long shot, but…

Still, I couldn’t just hand over a book that could elevate someone to a Rare class based on a good first impression. Since he’d made the request himself, I decided I’d observe him a bit longer. If he proved trustworthy, it wouldn’t be too late to give it to him.

Putting those thoughts aside, Shin Sang-yong’s proposal was highly appealing. A user with decent stats could be “lent” to us for free, with the condition of being mentored by Vivian. As long as I held the *Chimera Alchemist* book, recruiting him to our party wouldn’t be an issue.

I turned to Jeong Ha-yeon. Originally, I’d planned to pair her with Shin Sang-yong if he made such a proposal, but that was no longer necessary. To be precise, I didn’t need to use Shin Sang-yong as bait to lure Jeong Ha-yeon anymore. With the *Circle of Harmony*, Shin Sang-yong had instantly risen to a value comparable to hers.

Of course, she was still an attractive user. But I had no reason to cling to her. By my standards, I was still the best in the Hall Plane. If I were desperate enough to chase after Jeong Ha-yeon, I wouldn’t have let Kim Han-byeol, a Secret Class user, go so easily.

Noticing the intent in my gaze, Jeong Ha-yeon’s troubled expression deepened.

Shin Sang-yong’s earlier statement—“I’ll do my utmost for the party”—and Vivian’s “I’ll do whatever Su-hyeon says” carried significant weight. In essence, Shin Sang-yong had declared he’d fully follow the leader’s—my—orders upon joining, and I’d demonstrated my position through Vivian’s response.

He had a compelling reason: to hone his unconventional alchemy. Jeong Ha-yeon, however, did not.

With her skills, she could join a reputable caravan or apply to a clan. Although she currently wasn’t part of one, you never know what the future holds.

Taking advantage of her hesitation, I activated my *Third Eye*. I wanted to examine her information in more detail.

After closely examining Jeong Ha-yeon’s abilities, I smiled inwardly. Her potential abilities followed the standard mage path, and *Blessing of the Lake* was a rare special ability that suited her well. She likely excelled in water-related magic.

I was particularly impressed that she’d mastered *Swift Casting* and *Magic Circuit Application*. These required exceptional memory and calculation skills, yet she’d achieved B+ ranks in both. For a user I met in the small city of Mul, she was a real catch.

As Jeong Ha-yeon and I locked eyes, the others watched her with tense expressions, waiting for her response. The kids, knowing I’d already agreed to take her in, seemed to think Shin Sang-yong’s fate hinged on her decision.

After a brief silence, her tightly closed lips slowly parted.

“Good morning.”

“Oh, Leader. G-good morning. Haha.”

As I opened the door, I saw Shin Sang-yong coming up the stairs, yawning. When I greeted him, he responded with a bright smile. His polite words prompted a faint smile from me as I spoke.

“You don’t have to call me Leader. It makes me a bit embarrassed every time.”

“But a leader is a leader. Did you just wake up?”

“Yeah. Looks like you pulled another all-nighter, Shin Sang-yong.”

“I’ve been really busy lately. Between reviewing what my teacher taught me and my personal training, I barely have time to breathe.”

He looked genuinely happy. Feeling a twinge of envy, I nodded.

“It’s great to work hard, but make sure to take care of your condition. We’re heading out to explore again tomorrow morning.”

“I was actually planning to sleep on time tonight. But hearing that from you, Leader, feels kind of strange.”

He was playfully pointing out my even tighter schedule. With nothing to say, I gave a wry smile. We both burst into laughter, a rare moment of genuine amusement.

Seeing him yawn repeatedly, I stepped aside to let him pass. After he bowed politely and entered the room I’d just left, I turned around. The thought of our group finally coming together like a proper party brought a hum to my lips.

As I walked to the lobby, I saw the usual quiet tables and Go Yeon-ju dozing off. She looked so peaceful that I tried to move silently and took a seat at a suitable spot. My thoughts drifted to our newest members, Shin Sang-yong and Jeong Ha-yeon.

In the end, both had joined our party, but unlike Shin Sang-yong, Jeong Ha-yeon had set a condition. She agreed to work for the party’s benefit without seeking personal gain, just like him, but added, “If I want to leave later, I’d like the freedom to do so. That’s my minimum condition.”

I agreed immediately. We weren’t an official clan yet, and members leaving a caravan mid-journey was common enough to be unremarkable. In a way, the conditions were too favorable for us. I told Shin Sang-yong he could leave anytime if he wasn’t satisfied, but he just nodded once or twice, showing no intention of leaving anytime soon.

I’d initially planned to set out on an expedition the day after they joined, but I changed my mind and decided to stay in the city a few more days. Shin Sang-yong was eager to start learning, so I wanted to give him some time as a courtesy.

Vivian was the one benefiting most from this. Shin Sang-yong respectfully called her “Teacher,” boosting her ego, and Yu-jeong’s teasing had significantly decreased. As a result, Vivian was occasionally showing the cheerful side she’d displayed in the dungeon.

Watching the two newcomers, I was extremely satisfied—very, very satisfied. It might sound exaggerated, but after constantly cleaning up after the kids, seeing users who handled their tasks efficiently was almost moving.

Though Shin Sang-yong and Jeong Ha-yeon joined at the same time, their behaviors were polar opposites.

Shin Sang-yong lived each day with intense dedication. As someone who’d already reached a certain level and had a completely different class from mine, there wasn’t much for me to teach him. Yet he rose at dawn to meditate. His lifestyle revealed whether he was putting on a show for me or had always been this diligent. It might seem foolish to some, but I found his efforts endearing. He wasn’t a genius, but he was striving to climb higher. In a way, he reminded me of my first playthrough, which made it easy to like him.

In contrast, Jeong Ha-yeon’s life was meticulously structured. Honestly, living by a second-by-second schedule was something even I’d find exhausting. She woke up, ate, slept, and took personal time with clockwork precision. Her focus during waking hours was almost intimidating. Yet, she showed some flexibility by adjusting her schedule when needed.

In a way, their lifestyles reflected one facet of the Hall Plane. Even with such effort, they might never become top-tier users. The kids seemed to sense this too. They trained hard themselves, but these two lived with a desperate intensity.

Since their arrival, I noticed the kids’ attitudes shifting slightly again, which I saw as positive. You can never have too much determination.

“Speaking of which, it’s about time for them to come down.”

As I muttered to myself, I heard a door open upstairs, followed by the steady *click-clack* of footsteps. With a faint smile, I deliberately dragged my chair loudly. It was probably time to wake Go Yeon-ju, who was sleeping soundly.
