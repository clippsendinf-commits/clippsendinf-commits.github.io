# Memorize - Chapter 72 (72/1068)
# Project: Make a Pet

After I nearly lost consciousness, our party hurriedly escaped the dungeon. In the chaos, we almost forgot two users who had already collapsed, but thankfully, Vivian pointed them out, allowing us to carry them out one by one. Seeing that they still hadn’t regained consciousness, I was certain Vivian had tampered with them using her *Yaryo* trick. When I shot her a sharp glare, she subtly avoided my eyes, confirming my suspicions.

“Oppa, are you okay?” An-sol asked, her face full of worry as we trudged through the forest after leaving the dungeon.

“Yeah, I’m fine. Don’t worry too much,” I replied.

“But still…” she trailed off, her eyes fixed on me, clearly anxious. The concern of a sweet girl warmed my heart, but my mind was in disarray. The correlation between *Hwa-jeong*’s power and my stamina had far exceeded my expectations.

An-sol kept trying to talk, but I shook my head, hoisting one of the unconscious users onto my back again. Yu-jeong, overhearing our conversation, turned her head while leading the way and spoke up.

“Oppa, if it’s too much, I can carry one. With that mana reversal thing last time… it’s really worrying me.”

“I’m fine, just focus on what’s ahead. With An-hyeon and me each carrying a user, you’re the most important one right now. Of course, we can set them down if needed, but we’re vulnerable to sudden ambushes.”

“Tch… you think I don’t know that? I’m saying this because I’m worried!” Yu-jeong snapped.

“It’s safe around here,” Vivian interjected. “This is a shortcut to Mul, so we should arrive by tomorrow.”

Yu-jeong shot Vivian a glare before turning back. I wanted to comfort her for taking her frustration out on the wrong person, but my head was too cluttered. Right after using that power, I’d nearly collapsed from exhaustion. The intensity was too severe to brush off as mere dizziness.

I hadn’t anticipated it would be this bad. If this kept happening, I couldn’t treat it lightly anymore. Sure, I still had some ability points left, but I’d been leaning toward investing in Strength, Agility, or Magic Power, so I was torn.

Noticing my deep thought, An-hyeon followed quietly behind me, carrying an unconscious female user on his back. Watching him grow stronger by the day, I resolved to find him a *Ki-Gong Spearmaster* mentor, then turned my thoughts elsewhere.

No matter how much I pondered, the issue of ability points was beyond my control. If I dumped all my remaining points into Stamina and calculated the maximum points I could earn in the future, I might just hit 90. But that was it. The allure of reaching 101 in an ability was too strong to give up so easily.

After wrestling with these thoughts, I shook my aching head and cleared my mind. Since I couldn’t solve this now, it was better to focus on the present. Our priorities were the items we’d obtained in the dungeon, the two rescued users, and returning to the city for Vivian’s treatment. After a brief rest, we’d also need to prepare for the expedition to the Ruined Laboratory. Even without my ability point dilemma, there was a mountain of tasks to tackle. In *Hall Plane*, a single misstep could cost us everything, even if we’d started off on the right foot.

For now, I decided we’d rest and regroup in Mul after returning.

Clearing my mind, I looked at the kids with a blank expression. Suddenly, I felt an intense longing for a woman. Holding someone would let me shut off my thoughts for a while. I craved the warm pleasure of entwining bodies after so long.

Yu-jeong’s slightly furrowed brow and sharp expression caught my eye. Below that, her long, straight hair and the curve of her chest stood out. Her hair wasn’t that long during the *Rite of Passage*, but the length suited her perfectly. Then there was An-sol’s innocent face, her pale, slender neck, and her small, delicate lips… As my gaze shifted to Vivian, I snapped out of it. What was I thinking about these kids?

Was I that pent-up? I felt the need to find a woman soon to relieve this urge. For a moment, I felt pathetic. Sighing, I readjusted the user slipping down my back. Come to think of it, I still didn’t know who these two users were.

I’d been so preoccupied with *Hwa-jeong* and my stats that I hadn’t had time to think about anything else. I’d deliberately avoided taking the lead to focus on other matters. Now that I’d set those thoughts aside, I activated *The Third Eye*. After some rest and healing, the dizzying sensation from earlier was gone.

Hmm? I hadn’t expected much, but my eyes widened. Both were mages, and considering they were in their second year… they were impressive. At first, I’d wondered what kind of recklessness drove them into the Black Forest, but their stats explained it.

Suddenly, I felt coming to Mul was the right call. I’d initially come here because it was where I’d been active (though, to be fair, where *hadn’t* I been active?) and to find a *Ki-Gong Spearmaster*. But in terms of both talent and resources, we were reaping unexpected rewards. My gaze drifted to An-sol. Was her high Luck stat influencing this, as she walked along with that dazed expression?

Feeling the warmth of the person on my back, I pondered what to do with these two. Both would be valuable additions to our group. They were immediately useful, and while Year 2 marked the start of stat growth limitations, they still had room to improve, depending on the individual. After Year 4 or 5, raising stats became nearly impossible, but there was still some potential left.

Their stats were solid, and their alignments were good. I’d need to talk to them once they regained consciousness, but they were definitely worth recruiting.

After leaving the dungeon, we walked for a full day. Everyone was mentally exhausted from marching through the night, but thanks to the stamina training at the *User Academy*, no one fell behind. Vivian’s shortcut was truly remarkable. Having lived in the forest for over a century, it wasn’t surprising she knew the terrain so well. This seemed to shift the kids’ view of her slightly.

We began our return late in the afternoon, and after a day’s travel, we reached our destination as the sun set. Looking up and seeing the plains we’d first passed through, I let out a sigh of relief. The kids, recognizing the plains, quickened their pace.

The party’s mood was quiet during the journey. I was too lost in thought to talk much, and An-hyeon, carrying a user, was breathing heavily from the effort. Yu-jeong and An-sol looked anxious, while Vivian kept glancing around nervously. The subdued atmosphere wasn’t necessarily bad, but it felt a bit uncomfortable.

Leaving the dense forest behind, we hurried along the path to the plains. In the distance, Mul came into view.

Given the time of day, we spotted a few groups of users here and there. The closer we got to Mul, the more groups we saw. We’d arrived just before nightfall. Despite many users heading to Barbara, the number remaining here suggested others shared my mindset.

The kids, seeing other users for the first time in a while, didn’t know where to look. I spoke in a low voice.

“We’re just like those users. Don’t act like newbies—walk in confidently.”

I urged the dawdling kids forward in a tired voice. Vivian, who’d been gawking at the city and other users, flinched and lowered her head. I noticed several gazes fixating on us. Vivian had been naked initially, so we’d dressed her in the underwear and robe stripped from the deceased Jeong Ji-yeon. Since Vivian was taller, the clothes were tight, accentuating her figure embarrassingly well. With her fairly beautiful face and decent body, some rough-looking male users were openly staring with sleazy looks. Sighing, I signaled to Vivian with my eyes. She brightened and stuck close to my side.

“Hey, back off a bit,” I said.

“Oppa, can’t you see how tired you are?” she replied.

What’s with these girls? Seeing the two female users glaring daggers at her, Vivian shrank back, lowering her head. An-hyeon, watching this, clicked his tongue and spoke up.

“Yu-jeong, An-sol, what’s with you two? You’re embarrassing her. I get how you feel, but like Hyung said, don’t be too hard on her. I feel bad just watching.”

As soon as An-hyeon finished, the girls’ jealousy flared even more. That oblivious guy. Vivian’s face lit up as she smiled at him. It was like pouring oil on a fire. I’d brought her along because her cheerful, honest nature seemed like it’d mesh well with Yu-jeong and An-sol, but things were already off to a rocky start, and I felt uneasy.

The surroundings were bustling. Some complained about coming up empty, others about bad routes. Everyone looked exhausted, but their mouths never stopped moving. A few users returning with grim faces had likely lost comrades during their expeditions.

As dusk settled, Mul’s walls loomed directly ahead. The resident guards who’d greeted us when we first arrived were still at their posts, saluting the users. We slowly passed through the gate.

We had finally completed our first expedition and returned to Mul.
