# Chapter 117: Interesting

Come to think of it, I hadn’t been giving much thought to Yujeong. In the past, I might have brushed it off, thinking she could handle things on her own, but honestly, even I had to admit I’d been focusing more on Anhyeon lately. Even if we set Ansol aside as an exception due to her role as a priestess, comparing the other two, Anhyeon’s disposition suited my preferences more, which had led to this imbalance.

That thought hasn’t changed. Anhyeon’s latent potential was always higher, and with his recent acquisition of a Rare Class, the gap between them has widened even further. I was also aware that Yujeong, who secretly saw Anhyeon as a rival, likely wasn’t entirely at ease with this.

That said, it wasn’t as if Yujeong’s abilities were so lacking that she could be overlooked. She had more than enough potential to rise as a top-tier user. Since I personally chose and brought her along, how I guide and nurture her growth will determine whether she can become a renowned user in the future.

In short, it was a matter of differing potential.

For the time being, it was better if I didn’t directly train Anhyeon. Even setting aside the differences between sword and spear, reading and internalizing that book was an undeniable, essential process. My role was merely to offer advice; trying to teach him clumsily could actually ruin the inherent efficiency of a Ki-Gong Spearmaster.

Tapping the table lightly while organizing my thoughts, I looked at Yujeong, who was pouting, and spoke up.

“Yujeong, I think it’s better if I guide you.”

Anhyeon and Ansol’s eyes widened in surprise. At my simple words, Yujeong quickly tucked her protruding lips back in. Seeing her reaction, I couldn’t help but find it a little cute.

“O-oppa, you’re going to guide me? Aren’t you too busy?”

“I am busy, but… I’ve neglected you a bit lately. I can probably squeeze out enough time to look after you. It might not be all day, but I’ll do my best. Besides, in some ways, a sword can be seen as an extension of a dagger. All things considered, I think I’m the best one to train you.”

“W-Well… it’s just so sudden…”

Seeing Yujeong fidgeting with her fingers in an uncharacteristically shy manner, I gave her a gentle smile.

“What, you don’t want to?”

“N-No! Not at all! I love it!”

She shook her head so vigorously it almost looked exaggerated and flashed a wide grin. From the side, I could hear Anhyeon muttering, “Hyung, how could you do this to me?” and saw Ansol looking half-envious, half-sulky, but I ignored them and turned my head to respond.

After that, I spent about thirty minutes laying out the goals for this adjustment period.

To sum it up: First, Shin Sangyong would focus on training under Vivian’s guidance. Unless it was something important, he wouldn’t be summoned, much like the others. As a second-year user, expecting rapid growth like the kids was unrealistic. Still, while there was even a sliver of growth potential left, it was worth making the most of it.

As for Hayeon, I decided to let her operate as a free agent. “Free” meant she was guaranteed personal autonomy. Of course, since I’d asked her to guide Ansol, it wasn’t complete freedom. But Hayeon, understanding my intentions, agreed to follow my orders without complaint.

Granting her free status was a symbolic gesture known only to a few. Now that our clan was established and its structure was taking shape, giving someone freedom meant I trusted them that much. Besides, Hayeon was capable of handling herself well, so there was no need to meddle.

However, being in a small city came with its own issues. The biggest concern was finding a place for the kids to train. Going outside the city would solve it, but we had no plans to hunt monsters this week. The detection training we’d done so far could be conducted indoors, but the upcoming training involved a lot of physical movement. Even in a special room, conducting such training inside an inn was rather absurd.

But there was no clear solution. This was just a frontier city, and with the focus on advancing toward the Steel Mountains, development was slow. (The city’s leading clan was also pouring all its attention into the Steel Mountains expedition.) Having chosen the small city of Mul as our base, these were just things we had to endure. Still, I had no regrets. The benefits and achievements we’d gained so far made these issues bearable.

With that, I wrapped up most of my explanations. Preparations for the next expedition and clan establishment were tasks I’d handle myself, so there was no need to go into detail. Of course, there were still a few points to address.

I quietly pointed to the two mage users listening attentively.

“This evening, I have something to discuss with both of you privately. After finishing today’s tasks… let’s say, after dinner, please come to the special room on the far left of the third floor. It’s important.”

They’d probably already guessed since I’d mentioned the clan earlier. Hayeon and Shin Sangyong nodded calmly. I added one more thing.

“For your information, the special room on the far left will be my personal office from now on. If you need to see me, that’s where you can find me. Vivian?”

“Hm?”

Vivian, who for once wasn’t distracted and was listening intently, responded. It was only natural, but I couldn’t help feeling a bit proud.

“You should take a separate room too.”

“Sounds good, but… why?”

“I need an alchemist’s expertise. Can you set up a workshop in one of the special rooms? It doesn’t have to be elaborate—just enough to function.”

At the mention of a workshop, Vivian’s eyes narrowed. She tilted her head, rolling her eyes thoughtfully, then spoke with a slightly uncertain expression.

“Hmm… If it doesn’t need to be too fancy, I think I can manage. Can we talk details later?”

“It’s a bit awkward to get into now. I’ll explain when we have time. For now, I’ll talk to the innkeeper about it, so go check out the room. Make a list of anything you’ll need for the workshop.”

“Quite a bit, probably. But I’m not complaining. Can I go up now?”

“Of course. Even a one-off setup is fine. I’ll provide plenty of funding, so don’t worry about costs. Take a good look.”

When I nodded, Vivian stood up with cheerful energy. At the same time, I felt Shin Sangyong’s pleading gaze and reluctantly nodded again. The two of them, with excited expressions, quickly dashed up the stairs.

“…”

After confirming they’d disappeared upstairs, I turned to the rest of the group, who were staring blankly, and spoke.

“That’s all for today’s schedule. You guys can head up and start preparing. Anhyeon, go see Vivian tomorrow—I’ll let her know. And… Hayeon, stay behind for a bit. I need to talk to you.”

“Yes.”

Hayeon responded simply, while the kids reluctantly got up, following my orders. Yujeong kept lingering around me, but after I gave her a firm look, she quickly headed for the stairs. Watching the three of them climb up, I turned with a softened gaze. Hayeon was sitting quietly, waiting for me to speak.

“Hayeon, how’s your condition?”

“I’m… fine. Sorry, I didn’t want to make it obvious, but it’s not something I can control easily.”

She gave a faint smile in response to my concern. For a moment, an awkward silence hung between us. Even so, she looked at me with steady, clear eyes.

Meeting her gaze, I reached into my pocket, searching for an item. When my hand closed around what I was looking for, I pulled it out and placed it on the table. Hayeon’s eyes widened, and her lips parted slightly as she saw it. The item was the Glory Necklace, obtained from the Ruined Laboratory.

“This is…”

“Sorry I couldn’t give it to you earlier. It’s time it found its owner.”

“Suhyeon.”

“I’ve already appraised it. It’s called the Glory Necklace, just as it was known in the past. Your description back then was mostly accurate. Just note that the stored magic resets daily.”

Beyond its abilities, the Glory Necklace was unassuming at first glance but undeniably captivating upon closer inspection. Hayeon stared at the shimmering, beautiful necklace on the table with a dreamy expression. When she kept looking without moving, I prompted her again, and only then did she carefully pick it up.

As she put it around her neck, a clear, chiming sound rang out. After touching the necklace for a while, she spoke in a quiet voice.

“Suhyeon, this necklace feels like too much. But considering your sincerity, I’ll accept it. Besides… there’s no one else in our group who can make full use of its potential right now.”

Hayeon usually met my gaze head-on when speaking, but this time, her eyes darted around, and her words came out haltingly. Sensing something, I gave a soft smile.

“Heh, you’re acting like you don’t like it, but you do.”

When I teased her with a grin, she smiled back. But I could clearly see her earlobes turn slightly red.

“Haha, fine. Honestly, I’m happy. I’m happy to have this item, and I’m happy you’ve made me a free agent. And…”

She started to say something more but stopped herself. Instead, she looked at me warmly and concluded.

“I’ll treasure it. Oh, and… can I rest for just today? I’m really not feeling well. Not because of yesterday, but… well, I’m just not in great shape.”

Recovery was important, so I nodded readily. Based on how I’d seen Hayeon act before, if she was saying this, she was genuinely unwell. Unlike me, she wasn’t the type to push through despite exhaustion. Respecting her desire to face my orders in top condition, I agreed.

“From now on, you’re a free agent. Don’t push yourself, and rest when you need to. No one will judge you.”

“That’s something I’d like to say to you. Don’t try to do everything alone—share the load a bit.”

I had no response to that, so I just gave an awkward smile. Seeing my expression, Hayeon smiled lightly and gestured upstairs.

“I’ll still guide Ansol. Since we’re sharing a room, it’s convenient…”

“Hm…”

Sharing a room, huh? Wouldn’t that be a bit uncomfortable? Should I get her a separate room too? Noticing my concern, Hayeon spoke in a bright voice.

“Don’t worry too much. They’re good kids at heart. They just like you a lot. The extreme scenarios you’re imagining won’t happen.”

“Alright, I trust them. But if it gets tough, let me know right away. I’ll give them a stern talking-to.”

I meant it as a considerate remark, but Hayeon gently shook her head.

“Don’t ever do that.”

“But—”

“You really don’t understand women’s hearts. We have our own world. This is something I need to handle myself. Trust me a little more—that’s how you can help me.”

Her tone was soft but firm. With her putting it like that, I couldn’t think of anything to say. Scratching my head awkwardly, I nodded. In my opinion, Ansol wasn’t the type to cause trouble. Yujeong was a bit of a concern, but their relationship had been fine at the start. And with Hayeon as the senior, she wouldn’t be treated carelessly like Vivian might.

“Sigh. If you say so, alright. Let’s wrap this up for now. Come to my office tonight.”

“Yes. I’m already looking forward to it.”

In the past, I would’ve assumed she was anticipating a discussion about the clan I’d founded. But after our intimate moment, for a brief second, I interpreted her “looking forward to it” in a different way. Sighing inwardly, I stood up and approached her, extending my arm.

“If you’re still feeling unwell, let me help. Let’s go up together.”

Hayeon nodded gently and carefully took my hand. Leaning on each other, we headed for the stairs.
