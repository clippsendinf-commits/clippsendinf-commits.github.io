# Chapter 71: The Pet Project

“Be quiet.”

As soon as I spoke, Vivian clamped her mouth shut. But her eyes, burning with longing, kept staring at me, as if she hadn’t entirely given up hope. A memory flashed in my mind—twisting Ji-yeon’s neck in the clearing. She, too, had wanted something from me. To be spared. To be killed. Only she knew what she truly meant. But Vivian was different. She clearly wanted to live.

I’d need more details to be certain, but her Rare Class and stats were decent. A Magic Power stat of 92 points—solid enough to be useful even in the late stages. Her other stats were respectable for a mage, too. She wouldn’t hold up against the <Ten Strongest> or top-tier Users, but her class compensated for that.

The problem was the Elixir. Using one would be costly. I couldn’t just gather more GP to buy another; I’d already spent 77,777 GP on hidden items. If there were no way to get more, I wouldn’t use it—but that wasn’t entirely true. I knew of ways to obtain two more Elixirs in the future. Not places I could reach now, but I was certain of their locations. The two I’d reserved were for Yu-hyeon and So-yeong in case of worst-case scenarios. If I avoided those situations, I wouldn’t need them.

Vivian’s post-recovery stats would be: [Strength 48] [Endurance 50] [Agility 56] [Stamina 45] [Magic Power 92] [Luck 74]. She was already at her peak, but with luck, she might boost her Magic Power by another point or two. Having talent like hers join our party early on would obviously be a boon. Most importantly, she could fill our current lack of a mage.

The biggest advantage was having two Rare Class holders. If I had a User learn the book Vivian gave me, we’d have two of the same class. And since Vivian was already familiar with it, she could mentor the new User.

I felt my decision tipping in her favor. As a Resident, her death carried less weight (by my standards), and I’d have no qualms using her for a wish later. After weighing the pros and cons, I flashed a gentle smile and turned to Vivian.

“Vivian.”

“Yes?”

I steadied her frantically nodding head and met her gaze at eye level. Looking at her now, naked as she was, I couldn’t deny her beauty. Long, jet-black hair, silvery eyes, flawless pale skin (cracks aside), and a refined face. Her toned, graceful figure caught my eye, and I noticed her shrink back slightly. Her throat bobbed—she was clearly nervous.

“As an alchemist, you must know about equivalent exchange.”

“Y-Yes… Exchanging things of equal value…”

“Right. You offered what you had, and I agreed to save you. That’s equivalent exchange. So, if I save you again, what can you offer in return?”

“B-But…”

“I know it’s unfortunate how things turned out. But I can heal you completely. I might even restore your lost power. This is your only chance to return to human form without turning back into a spider.”

“H-How?”

Her eyes widened, trembling. Her reaction suggested she regretted becoming a spider monster, even if subconsciously. I’d hooked her, so I leaned in, whispering in a softer tone, one hand stroking her hair, the other her back. Each touch made her tremble more.

“You’ll see. If I save your life, restore your strength, and return your human form, shouldn’t you pay a price equal to that?”

“…What do you want? You know I have nothing left to give…”

“No, you have one thing.”

I poked her back gently, causing a slight crack in her skin, but I didn’t care. The Elixir would fix it. Vivian winced in pain, then her face hardened as she understood. The moment of choice had arrived.

Silence hung between us. But, as I’d seen, Vivian had an obsessive attachment to life. When her head finally nodded faintly, I allowed myself a satisfied smile.

“You’ll listen to me from now on, got it?”

“…Okay.”

Her voice was subdued, almost sulky, as she responded to my vaguely ominous words.

Carrying the items Vivian gave me and two User cocoons, I returned to the clearing. Four cocoons lay there. I quickly cut the threads and freed the others. As each was released, they saw my face and lit up with joy.

After a brief reunion, their attention naturally shifted to the mysterious woman and the two remaining cocoons. Vivian’s situation was the priority. I’d coordinated with her beforehand, but I was a bit worried. To my surprise, she handled it better than expected.

“So, you’re saying an evil mage turned you into a spider long ago?” Yu-jeong asked.

“Yes. But this person extracted the core that made up the spider’s body, allowing me to regain my sense of self,” Vivian replied.

“But even if you were a spider, you still have memories. You killed Users, built a dungeon…”

“After becoming a spider, I couldn’t leave. I’d have been hunted down immediately. And after my body was infected, the core’s influence degraded my intelligence to that of a monster. I have memories, but it’s hard to say they were my intentions. If I’d been human, I never would’ve done those things.”

“Hmm…”

Yu-jeong shot her a suspicious glance before turning to me. I jumped in to back Vivian’s story.

“She’s telling the truth. If it weren’t for Vivian, I’d be dead. Without her help in restraining the spider from the inside at the right moment, we’d all be goners.”

Yu-jeong and An-sol looked conflicted. Vivian’s acting was convincing, and I smiled inwardly. Mixing truth with lies, I was deceiving the others. To integrate Vivian into our party, I needed to soften the impact of her past actions.

“But that doesn’t change what you did,” Yu-jeong pressed.

“Of course. I’m not trying to dodge responsibility,” Vivian replied.

“And what’s with your body? Your shoulders and back look cracked…”

An-hyeon cut in, redirecting the conversation. Vivian glanced at me before answering.

“My body’s in a dangerous state. Extracting the core brought me back, but it’s taken a toll.”

“So, you’re saying you’ll die soon?”

“Probably.”

At that, the others’ faces darkened, as expected. They were confused. I seized the moment to step forward and lay it out plainly.

“For now, we plan to travel with Vivian.”

Their eyes snapped to me. An-hyeon looked surprised, while Yu-jeong and An-sol frowned, clearly unhappy. But they’d never opposed my decisions since entering the Hall Plane, and I wasn’t backing down on this one.

Recruiting promising Users was fine, but we needed to move quickly. A User or Resident who could contribute immediately was more practical than one who’d take time to grow. With Vivian, my plans could progress at least 30% faster.

“She seems conflicted about what she’s done,” I continued. “If she can survive, she wants to atone. Sure, her actions weren’t right, but there’s room for leniency. She’s showing remorse. So, let’s take her to the city, find a way to heal her, and if it works, we’ll travel together. If not… well, that’s that. Sound fair?”

An-hyeon was more lenient in these matters. My real concern was Yu-jeong and An-sol, who still looked reluctant. But their kind natures and my claim that Vivian saved me seemed to sway them. When I added, “She might die soon,” they finally nodded, grudgingly convinced.

I let out a relieved sigh. I’d resolved a major issue in a flash. They weren’t fully on board yet, but getting Vivian into the party was a success—time would handle the rest.

I exchanged glances with the others, then turned to where the two Users lay. Their gazes followed mine. On top of the two opened cocoons were a male and a female User, lying still—the two Vivian had captured.

Honestly, teasing Vivian was so fun I’d forgotten about them. If she hadn’t called out to me as I was leaving the passage, I might’ve left them behind.

Their faint breathing confirmed they were alive, but their faces were pale. Both wore mage robes, so their Stamina stats likely weren’t high. Yu-jeong, watching them, spoke with concern.

“Oppa, are they going to die like this?”

“They won’t. But we should get to the city as fast as possible.”

“I know a shortcut,” Vivian offered, raising her hand.

Yu-jeong glared at her. “Hmph. You talk a good game. Whose fault is this, anyway?”

Vivian’s face flared with irritation, but she bit her lip and held back. Seeing her follow my instruction to stay composed was reassuring, though she couldn’t hide her frustration, huffing through her nose.

Ignoring their tension, I turned back to the Users. I needed to check their info. As I activated my Third Eye, a sharp pain shot through my head. My vision blurred, and I shook my head to refocus. But the world seemed to tilt.

“Oppa, what’s wrong…?”

An-sol, who’d been watching me closely, rushed to support me. What was happening?

Noticing my distress, An-hyeon, Yu-jeong, and Vivian approached. I tried to say I was fine and force my Third Eye again, but—

“Ugh…”

“Hyung!”

“Oppa!”

My vision spun, and my body went limp. This feeling… exhaustion? Then Seraph’s words echoed in my mind.

<User Kim Su-hyeon, the power of Hwa-jeong is not something humans can take lightly. In terms of raw power, it’s unparalleled, but controlling and mastering it is another matter entirely. To use it properly, your Stamina needs to exceed 101 points. At the very least, 90…>

I hadn’t even used it at full strength, and yet… As that thought faded, darkness closed in. My eyes were shutting on their own.

[Potential Ability: Unyielding (Rank: A+) activates.]

A message flashed in the air, and a surge of will forced my collapsing body to stand.
