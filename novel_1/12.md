# Memorize - Episode 11 (11/1068)

# Split in Half

“Always sticking your nose in. If you just stayed quiet, you’d at least be middle-of-the-pack, huh?”

Park Dong-geol frowned at the sharp-tongued woman’s immediate jab but didn’t snap back. Instead, he spoke in a much softer tone than before.

“Didn’t you hear what this lady just said? She asked us not to fight among ourselves.”

“Why don’t you take a look at your own actions before you talk?”

“Well, that’s fair. Still, since we’re gathered to share ideas, how about we at least hear each other out?”

The group swallowed hard, taken aback by Park Dong-geol’s quick concession. The sharp-tongued woman furrowed her brow, as if wondering if he’d eaten something strange.

“I’ll start by apologizing to everyone for my behavior back at the clearing. And even if my way of talking comes off rough, don’t take it personally. It’s just how I am—I don’t have any bad feelings toward any of you.”

Park Dong-geol glanced around and gave a slight bow. Though some still looked at him with dissatisfaction, the tension in their gazes had eased considerably. Moving slowly toward the center of the group, he gauged their reactions. Deciding the mood was right for discussion, he got to the point.

“I agree with some of what the bank teller lady said. Yeah, fighting among ourselves right now isn’t the way to go. Let’s put aside any bad feelings for now and figure out how to escape those monsters and survive. Sound good?”

“…Go ahead and say your piece, then,” Lee Bo-rim replied.

“Like I said, I agree with parts of it, but not all. To cut to the chase, I want everyone to realize the situation we’re each in.”

“What parts don’t you agree with?” Lee Bo-rim asked, her tone slightly petulant.

Park Dong-geol flashed a fleeting, grim smile before answering.

“Figuring out a way to survive is obvious, but I don’t think ‘cooperation’ is gonna happen. Cooperation? Sounds nice. But given our situation and how we’re all feeling, it just sounds like empty talk to me.”

“What’s that supposed to mean? If you don’t like it, leave. Go off on your own and survive by yourself,” the sharp-tongued woman scoffed.

Park Dong-geol didn’t flinch. Instead, he nodded, as if agreeing with her.

“I’ve definitely considered that.”

“Then go!”

“Hear me out first. Let me finish, alright? Just listen.”

An-hyeon shot her a look, and though the sharp-tongued woman bristled, she clamped her mouth shut. Park Dong-geol, now holding everyone’s attention, continued calmly.

“I’m not the sharpest guy. And yeah, I’m rough around the edges. But I don’t lie. I’m straightforward. Back at the clearing, when I was running for my life and nearly died, I felt a lot and thought a lot. Ever since, the word ‘cooperation’ has been rubbing me the wrong way.”

His words made the group shudder, as if recalling the chaos at the clearing. Noticing their reaction, Park Dong-geol’s Adam’s apple bobbed slightly, as if he’d been waiting for this moment.

“To be honest, I wasn’t just nervous—I was scared out of my mind. Embarrassing to admit, but my legs were shaking so bad I thought I’d wet myself. Think about it. Those things we’ve only seen in movies or on TV were right in front of us. What choice did we have? If that guy over there keeping watch hadn’t moved so fast, most of us would probably be monster chow by now. So I thought hard about it. This isn’t about bragging or threatening, so don’t get me wrong. I’ve handled a blade before. Whether it’s a knife or whatever, I can kill—people, animals, doesn’t matter—without hesitating. Why? Because I don’t want to die. Back at the clearing, it all happened so fast I panicked, but I want to live. If I’m in that situation again, I’ll swing this weapon to survive.”

Park Dong-geol’s speech was long, and he wasn’t done yet. Though some still looked skeptical, the group began to focus on his words. I clicked my tongue inwardly, sensing his intentions, but decided to keep watching for now. He started pointing at people one by one, pressing his point.

“I don’t know about everyone else, but that punk-looking guy over there seems like he can handle himself. He’s got a weapon, and he’s taken down monsters before, so… yeah. And you,” he gestured at the sharp-tongued woman, “if you can back up that mouth of yours with action, you might be some help. The guy with the crossbow goes without saying. So, the four of us—we could actually help each other. Cooperation might work with us. Am I wrong?”

An-sol, Lee Shin-u, and Lee Bo-rim’s faces darkened, as his words implied they were useless. Finally, Lee Bo-rim mustered the courage to raise her voice.

“So, you’re saying you can’t cooperate with people who aren’t helpful?”

“Whoa, whoa, calm down. I’m not done yet.”

“What the—”

“Can you do what that guy or the crossbow guy can do? You think you could pick up a rock or a knife and stab those monsters? From what I’ve seen, you’re nowhere close. Especially you and that kid clinging to you—you were screaming your head off every time those things showed up. At least that woman over there,” he pointed at the one who’d asked me earlier why I stepped away, “kept her mouth shut. She didn’t get in the way. If you could even manage that, I wouldn’t be saying anything.”

The woman he pointed to still maintained her cool, composed demeanor.

After a brief pause, Lee Bo-rim spoke again, her voice trembling and much softer than before.

“So, your conclusion is to abandon the people who aren’t helpful…”

Watching her struggle to continue, I thought about Park Dong-geol as a person. I wasn’t blind to what he was aiming for, but his words were worth reconsidering. I’d initially pegged him as just a hotheaded idiot, but he was assessing the situation fairly accurately and building his own logic—whatever his true motives were.

Seeing Lee Bo-rim deflated, Park Dong-geol bared his yellowed teeth and spoke with renewed confidence.

“Why are you jumping ahead? I haven’t said anything about abandoning anyone yet. Don’t get so sensitive. The world’s about give and take. Cooperation only works if you can pull your weight to some degree. If we just go out there half-baked, talking about ‘cooperation,’ what do you think will happen? That punk’s gonna be too busy protecting his girlfriend, and that kid will probably freeze up and get in the way—if we’re lucky. I’m saying I don’t want to protect or cooperate with people who’ll just drag us down. My life comes first. Don’t you all feel the same?”

Even the sharp-tongued woman was fidgeting with her hands, at a loss for words. The bank teller’s face was visibly flushed, her clenched fists trembling, but she too seemed to have nothing to say. Park Dong-geol, leisurely taking in their reactions, seemed to sense it was time to play his trump card and launched into a smooth, flowing speech.

“Everyone here probably values their own life above all else. If you can admit that, let’s be real. Some people here can’t cooperate. Right now, they’re just blindly relying on others. You, kid,” he pointed at An-sol.

An-sol, startled at being singled out, glanced at An-hyeon with a panicked expression. She opened and closed her mouth, as if wanting to say something, but no words came out. She lowered her head again. Park Dong-geol shrugged dramatically and continued.

“That guy knows it too. That’s why he told the kid to walk on her own earlier. If she’d gone with the crossbow guy when he said to move, she wouldn’t be in this mess, right? What’s with all the looks? Am I talking nonsense again?”

It wasn’t exactly nonsense. Whatever his intentions, he’d evaluated the situation with some accuracy. The problem was, he was throwing a verbal fastball at the people who needed help.

“If you think I’m wrong, prove it. Go down the hill right now, kill one or two of those monsters, and bring them back to me. Do that, and I’ll shut up immediately.”

“…”

Park Dong-geol, as if he’d said all he needed to, stepped back to his spot. I was curious about the others’ reactions and started scanning their faces.

An-hyeon had his eyes closed, lost in deep thought, while An-sol trembled slightly, looking at her brother. The most pitiful were Lee Bo-rim and Lee Shin-u. It was clear Park Dong-geol had targeted them from the start. They were visibly tense, their teeth chattering. For a while, no one spoke, but An-hyeon was the first to break the silence.

“I get what you’re saying.”

Normally quiet, An-hyeon glanced at his sister before speaking clearly.

“But Sol isn’t my girlfriend—she’s my little sister. I have no intention of abandoning her. Not even a shred.”

“Oppa…”

An-sol, touched, threw her arms around An-hyeon. Park Dong-geol, caught off guard by the sibling revelation, responded awkwardly.

“Siblings, huh? I didn’t know. Well, that’s that, then. But it doesn’t change anything. Who can guarantee we won’t end up in another mess like before?”

The situation was getting interesting. Unable to target An-hyeon directly, Park Dong-geol was now pressuring him through An-sol, who was undeniably a liability. He’d chosen to break away on his own terms, but not quietly—he was shaking the group up in the process. An-hyeon fell silent, and the hill grew so quiet you could barely hear breathing.

“Don’t take it too harshly. I talked a lot, but the point is, we can’t keep going in this half-baked state. It’s not gonna work. Seems like a lot of you don’t like me either.”

“So, what exactly do you want?” the sharp-tongued woman asked, her edge softened compared to before.

Park Dong-geol answered immediately.

“I want to form a proper team here.”
