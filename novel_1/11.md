# Memorize - Chapter 10 (10/1068): Kim Su-hyeon Begins the Rite of Passage

Suddenly, I recalled a TV show I once enjoyed. What would happen if an ordinary person was abruptly thrust into a life-threatening situation? The show claimed that people act rationally for only about fifteen minutes when faced with danger. After that, reason fades, and they operate purely on instinct. If that’s true, could I say that the group I’m leading right now has already skipped past that rational phase?

We were currently positioned on a high hill in the forest, pausing to catch our breath. Despite calling it a hill, the climb had been steep, and everyone was visibly exhausted. As I glanced down, my expectations were confirmed. Just an hour ago, the clearing where we’d rested was now swarmed with Deadmen.

The group stared at the tiny clearing below, barely visible through the trees, and let out groans of dismay. It was obvious that if we’d lingered even a moment longer, we would’ve become prey for those creatures. Even the sharp-tongued girl, who usually had something to say, was rubbing her arms, clearly unnerved.

Everyone’s expressions were a mix of complex emotions. The reality of monsters and mortal danger was sinking in, and their faces betrayed a flood of negative feelings—fear, dread, disbelief—without needing words. But there was little I could do to ease their minds. For now, I planned to stay quiet and observe from the sidelines. I’d already checked their basic User information, but I needed to see how they’d act in a real situation.

“*Huff! Huff!* What the hell… are those things?” Park Dong-geol panted, still catching his breath from the climb. I shook my head at him. If he’d just stay quiet, he might come off as halfway decent. After all, the crisis we’d just escaped was his fault—he’d kicked a stone that drew the Deadmen’s attention. He was the root of the problem. If it were me, I’d have kept my mouth shut out of shame, but his brazenness knew no bounds.

Sighing, I turned my head and saw An-sol, still crying in An-hyeon’s arms. For a moment, I felt a pang of disdain, but the experience had revealed something important. If this sobbing An-sol was indeed the future Priest of Radiance I knew, with her 100-point Luck stat, I’d assumed she’d breeze through the Rite of Passage. But she hadn’t. This confirmed that even slight changes in actions could alter the future significantly.

An-hyeon, wiping An-sol’s tears, noticed my gaze and gave a slight bow, likely thanking me for shooting the Deadman earlier. I nodded back to reassure him and turned my attention to the hill’s base.

*Grr! Grr!*

“*Eek!*”

“*Wah!*”

Whether it had been lurking nearby or had followed us from the clearing, two more Deadmen appeared, scrambling desperately up the hill. They weren’t as fast as before, though. Deadmen could charge quickly in a straight line toward prey, but their speed dropped significantly when navigating curves or climbing steep terrain. They could still make it up the hill, but a swift stab to the head would end them before they got close.

The group was less panicked than when they first saw the Deadmen, but screams still rang out. I felt a bit bad for Lee Bo-rim, but I had no intention of going out of my way to save her. Her incessant screaming alongside An-sol was grating, and her User information didn’t suggest she’d be particularly useful. If she survived, good for her; if not, that was her fate.

‘It’s about time for some reactions to show… Cooperation, division, or maintaining the status quo?’

To have a proper discussion, we needed to deal with the Deadmen climbing up first.

That’s when An-hyeon moved. Having left his sword in the clearing, he picked up a fist-sized rock. I paused loading my crossbow, curious to see what he’d do. I wanted to know if his earlier feat—cutting off a Deadman’s arm with a sword—was skill or just luck. How many average Korean men could hit a target with a thrown weapon?

An-hyeon carefully gauged the distance and direction before hurling the rock with all his might. The result was…

*Thud!*

“Not a big deal,” he muttered.

His throw was impressive. The rock smashed into the Deadman’s head with a satisfying *thud*, felling it instantly. An-hyeon’s eyes gleamed with realization as he effortlessly took down the second one as well.

“See? No big deal. So don’t act all high and mighty over two measly kills,” Park Dong-geol sniped, clearly irritated by An-hyeon’s success. An-hyeon stopped in his tracks and fixed Park with a steady gaze.

Slowly, An-hyeon’s lips parted. “Thanks to you, *ajusshi*.”

“What nonsense are you spouting now?” Park snapped.

“I saw a hefty rock lodged in the chest of the one that went after Sol. Thanks to that, I knew a stone could do the job.”

Park Dong-geol’s face darkened, realizing An-hyeon was mocking him. An-hyeon’s words were a pointed jab at Park’s earlier blunder with the stone that nearly got them all killed.

“Hey, so you’re saying *my* rock caused this mess? How do you even know it was mine?” Park growled.

“I never said that. Just thanking you,” An-hyeon replied smoothly.

Park geared up to snap back, but something seemed to click, and he switched to a menacing tone. “Fine, then what did *you* do right? Don’t you know we almost died because of that girl clinging to you?”

“Girl?” An-hyeon’s voice hardened.

“Yeah, that crazy *girl*. Everyone else managed to climb up just fine, but she can’t even stand on her own like some kid?”

An-hyeon’s face stiffened. He had no retort, and An-sol, feeling guilty for causing her brother trouble, hung her head and wiped her eyes. 

“Oh, your tough-guy act is *really* getting on my nerves. Who’s the real cause of this mess, huh?” the sharp-tongued girl cut in, not missing a beat. She jumped to An-hyeon’s defense, and Park’s scowl deepened.

“Hey, you little *brat*. Shut that pretty mouth of yours before I shut it for you,” Park snarled.

“Oh, you *jerk*. If I were you, I’d be too ashamed to open my mouth after causing this mess. And thanks for calling me pretty,” she shot back.

“You damn punks are really asking for it today…” Park muttered, but the group’s mood was turning against him. Realizing he was losing ground, he finally shut up.

Just when it seemed the crisis was over, another argument flared up. Their bickering was beyond mere incompatibility—it was practically enmity. Frustration welled up inside me, and I instinctively reached for a cigarette, only to remember I didn’t have any. Cutting Park out of the group was starting to feel like the best way to move forward.

Still, I’d decided to observe for now, so I stuck to that plan. I’d gone through the trouble of getting everyone here; backtracking to square one would be infuriating. The memory of the recent danger was still fresh in their minds. How could I unite this group? No clear solution came to mind. For now, I decided to step away. Strictly speaking, this hill wasn’t entirely safe either.

*Click!*

I deliberately made a loud noise as I loaded my crossbow, drawing everyone’s attention. With a neutral expression, I finished loading and met their eyes. 

“For now, avoiding those Deadm— *ahem*, monsters—seems like the priority.”

“Obviously. What’s your point?” Park grumbled.

‘This idiot’s begging to get himself killed,’ I thought, barely restraining the urge to shoot an arrow into his mouth. If we were alone, I might’ve already silenced him.

“We’re in a situation where we need all the strength we can muster, and fighting among ourselves is a waste of time. I’m going to step away for a bit. While I’m gone, discuss and decide on our next move.”

“Why are you leaving? Shouldn’t we discuss this together?” The question came from an unexpected source—a cool, composed woman I hadn’t checked earlier. She looked about my age, maybe a year or two younger, and her demeanor reminded me of someone familiar.

‘Let you all sort this out and see what happens,’ I thought.

“Those monsters could rush us like they did in the clearing. I’ll keep watch nearby just in case. Call me when you’ve reached a decision.”

“…Don’t go too far,” she said after a slight pause.

My delayed response didn’t raise unnecessary suspicion, thankfully. No one would object to someone volunteering to stand guard. With that, I headed toward a spot I’d noticed on the way up, perfect for concealment. Once I’d put some distance between us and slipped into the forest, I activated my mana. My senses sharpened, my vision and hearing becoming acutely sensitive. From this distance, they couldn’t see me, but I could hear their every breath and observe them closely.

After I left, a tense silence settled over the hill. The sprawled corpses of the Deadmen below added to the eerie atmosphere. No one spoke first, their expressions varied but guarded. Park Dong-geol’s face was the most interesting—shifting from a deep frown to a sly grin, as if plotting something. I half-wondered if he was unhinged.

Time passed. In other novels or comics, a protagonist would step up, rally the group, and lead them to safety. But this group lacked a clear leader. Letting time slip by like this was far from ideal. The longer we lingered, the more their anxiety would grow, and someone might snap and act on instinct.

Then, two women stood up.

Surprisingly, Lee Bo-rim stepped into the center of the group. The sharp-tongued girl, who’d risen at the same time, glanced at her and sat back down, seemingly willing to hear her out. Lee Bo-rim, scanning the group with nervous eyes, began to speak.

“You all saw those monsters just now, right? Honestly… when that angel, the guide, told us about this, I thought it was just a bad dream. But now, I have no choice but to accept this is real. I’m scared. I’m so scared I feel like I’m going crazy. And I’m sure some of you feel the same.”

No one interrupted. Sensing their attention, Lee Bo-rim’s voice gained confidence.

“Honestly, we only survived because of the person who went to keep watch. But they’re just like us—we can’t rely on them alone. Instead of fighting, I think we should work together to find a way to survive.”

Her words were cliché but hit the core of the Rite of Passage: cooperate and act. Her plea seemed to shift the mood slightly, breathing life into the stagnant atmosphere. Even Lee Shin-u, who’d been quiet and dejected, finally spoke up.

“So, what do you think we should do, noona…?” His voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: since you spoke up, tell us your plan.

Lee Bo-rim, caught off guard, answered hesitantly, “I… I’m not sure yet. But I think we should stop fighting and calmly share our ideas.”

“I agree,” Park Dong-geol said, stepping forward.

His face now carried a calm, serious expression, unlike earlier. But I frowned immediately. To others, he might seem sincere, but I could tell it was a facade. He was definitely scheming something.
