# Chapter 137: A Meaningful Conclusion

A day where similar routines repeat. Maintenance is not merely a word for rest. As the term suggests, it means organizing a disordered system to make it properly equipped. In that sense, the entire party was diligently carrying out their maintenance.

At the faint sound of movement, I opened my eyes and felt the chilly morning air enveloping the bed. Taking a deep breath of the cold air, my mind felt a bit clearer. Reflexively, I glanced at the table and saw, as usual, a steaming cup of tea and a few documents. I immediately got up.

“Ugh.”

My stiff body loosened as I circulated mana gently, giving it a light twist. *Crack, crack.* Rhythmic sounds of joints popping rang out. Shivering briefly from the refreshing yet slightly painful sensation, I strode toward the table. First, I picked up the teacup, from which white steam was rising.

“Pfft.”

Upon seeing the contents of the teacup, I couldn’t help but chuckle. The tea was pitch black. In the past, I had suspected poison when served tea, and it seemed she was still teasing me about it. Who would’ve thought she’d still hold a grudge from back then? With a wry smile, I took a sip, and a refreshing sensation slid down my throat. Feeling my mind clear and my body lighten, I spoke to her by the table.

“Good LaBin tea. Well brewed.”

“…Hmph. It’s a fine tea with Rekl added. I was going to stop brewing it if you complained again, but it seems you’ve learned your lesson.”

A soft voice echoed through the room, and a shadow flickered by the table. As Go Yeon-ju fully revealed herself, I responded calmly.

“Indeed. But why is someone who usually leaves right after setting the tea still here today?”

“I’m in a bit of a hurry. First, read the documents in front of you.”

*Slurp.*

I took another sip of the tea while picking up the documents. The taste was excellent. Noticing that I liked the tea, Go Yeon-ju wore a faint smile. If only her behavior were a bit more refined, she’d truly be the perfect bride—beautiful face, great figure, good at cooking, and probably skilled at *that* too… Ahem, anyway, I held the documents up to my eyes.

> …Thus, the movements of the Golden Lion Clan have officially begun. The participating clans are primarily the Golden Lion Clan and the representative clan of the western general city, Halo, known as SSUN (including their affiliated clans). On the morning of the day in question, the departure of twelve reconnaissance teams composed of skilled users was confirmed. Notably, the emergence of the Secret Class, Jewel Mage, has significantly boosted morale. This highlights the Golden Lion Clan’s tight control over information. While the allied clan members are in a celebratory mood, there was no sign of unrest. Based on their reactions, it is speculated they were informed in advance. Conversely, the vagrants settled in the Eurokia Mountains are greatly shaken by the appearance of this new Secret Class…

“Hmm.”

As I read the document, I felt my eyes narrowing. Damn Golden Lion Clan. So they’re planning to use Kim Han-byeol like this? It was clear that bringing her back later wouldn’t be met with kind words. Of course, it’s still uncertain whether I’d take her in or if she’d even join our clan. I had planned to meet her when visiting Barbara after the Golden Lion Clan falls, but things have gotten a bit complicated. With a sigh, I folded the document. It felt like the time had come.

“Here or not, it doesn’t matter.”

“What’s here or not?”

Go Yeon-ju suddenly interjected, and I posed a question.

“User Go Yeon-ju, what if this Jewel Mage were to join our party in the future?”

“That’d be great. But let’s not get our hopes up too soon.”

Her clear response made me hum thoughtfully. I wanted to ask, “What about a Rare Class?” but it felt like wordplay, so I dropped it. Instead, I made another request.

“I’m planning a major announcement today. Please inform everyone to join breakfast on time.”

“Oh? So we’re heading out soon?”

I nodded in response to her excited question.

“Yes.”

“Awesome! See you in the lobby, then.”

With a genuinely thrilled expression, Go Yeon-ju practically skipped out of my room.

*<Is oppa someone we can trust, then?>*

Suddenly, that cold, aloof face came to mind. A bold female user for a Year 0. She’s probably struggling a lot in the Golden Lion Clan by now. I mulled over her memory for a moment before downing the rest of the tea.

After finishing the sweet yet slightly bitter LaBin tea, I quickly stripped off my clothes. First, I wanted to wash up.

*

“Wow, unni! You’re so cool!”

“Not pretty?”

“Pretty too, but so cool! Wow…”

Perhaps tipped off by Go Yeon-ju, Lee Yu-jeong came down wearing the new equipment I had purchased. The leather set was definitely worth its price. While practicality is prioritized in the Hall Plane, appearances aren’t entirely ignored either. Equipment that’s both stylish and high-performing is hard to come by.

“Oppa, what do you think of Yu-jeong unni? Pretty, right? Huh?”

“Uh, uh? Heh, heh. They say clothes are wings, don’t they? She’s the perfect example.”

An-hyeon was clearly smitten by Lee Yu-jeong’s unusually feminine appearance. His gaze was fixed on her chest. The tight shirt she wore accentuated her curves without restraint. Caught staring, An-hyeon hurriedly averted his eyes when An-sol called out to him. I began to suspect that An-hyeon might judge women based on their chests.

Even so, he kept stealing glances. Noticing this, Lee Yu-jeong flashed a sly smile. In the past, she would’ve called him a pervert or creep, but after training with Go Yeon-ju, she was noticeably different.

“Where’s Vivian?”

“She’ll be down soon.”

“Got it. Hmm… Maybe I shouldn’t have worn the jacket. It’s a bit hot.”

Deliberately stretching to emphasize her chest, Lee Yu-jeong took off her jacket and hung it on a chair. She then crossed her arms under her chest, subtly leaning on the table. It was subtle, but I could tell she had used the size adjustment function on her clothes. They were slightly tighter, making her chest stand out even more, with the shirt buttons straining.

“Phew, it’s hot. Why is it so warm?”

Not stopping there, she undid the top button with a seductive smile, revealing her cleavage. At that, An-hyeon and Shin Sang-yong simultaneously turned away, their faces flushed, coughing awkwardly. Watching them, Lee Yu-jeong smirked.

“Ugh, men.”

“Ho ho.”

Go Yeon-ju let out a pleased laugh, looking proud as if her teachings had paid off. For a moment, I wanted to grab her by the neck and demand what she’d been teaching, but I barely restrained myself.

As we waited for Vivian, I activated my Third Eye, focusing on the kids. Since they were the most important, I needed to check their growth.

Seeing the kids’ progress brought a sense of satisfaction. An-hyeon was steadily climbing, with balanced increases in Strength, Endurance, Agility, and Magic, indicating diligent training across all areas. I had thought Agility might be harder to raise, but it seemed influenced by his training in the Ki-Gong Spearmaster’s martial arts.

Lee Yu-jeong’s stats were compared to when she first arrived in Mul. Even so, her growth was remarkable. While her Strength, Endurance, and Stamina lagged behind An-hyeon’s, her Agility and Magic exceeded 70. For a close-combat class, having Magic over 70 and awakening her special ability, *Blood-Soaked Heart*, was highly encouraging. Though currently D-Minus, raising it to B-rank or higher would make it quite useful.

Based on their specialized stats, no one would believe they were Year 0 users. However, I was slightly concerned about Lee Yu-jeong’s decreased Luck and changed disposition. Likely, both were due to her becoming the user of the Magic Sword Skrep. *True and Desire*—True wasn’t necessarily bad, but Desire needed careful management to create synergy. For now, I decided to keep an eye on it. I turned my attention to An-sol.

An-sol showed the least growth among the three, but that didn’t mean she hadn’t put in effort. With a +1 boost from her ring, her Magic stat was now on par with Jeong Ha-yeon’s. While her physical stats were low, I knew how much effort mages and priests invested to raise their Magic stat even by a single point.

As I evaluated their stats, I heard lively footsteps. Vivian had arrived, rushing to the table and plopping down, brushing back her wet hair.

“Sorry, sorry. I’m a bit late. What’s for breakfast?”

“We were waiting for you. I’ll bring it out now. It gets cold if I bring it out too early.”

“Yay!”

As Vivian cheered, Go Yeon-ju smiled brightly and stood up. Giving me a quick glance, she headed to the kitchen. I cleared my throat calmly.

“Ahem.”

“Soo-hyun, do you have something to say?”

At my cough, the party’s attention naturally turned to me. The quick-witted Jeong Ha-yeon promptly set the stage. I nodded once and spoke, looking at everyone.

“It’s about time we wrap up our maintenance.”

“…”

The group still looked nonchalant, as if they were simply acknowledging it. Originally, I had planned to leave after about two and a half months, but I thought it might be better to move things up a bit. Since the expedition report and clan establishment were slightly delayed, it would be better to finish maintenance, leave Mul, and start acting immediately upon return.

As the party waited for my next words, I continued in a low voice.

“I’ve received information that the Golden Lion Clan has finally begun its full-scale operations.”

This announcement elicited varied reactions. Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong’s faces hardened, while the kids remained relaxed, likely thinking it was just about the next expedition. Vivian, meanwhile, was licking her lips, glancing toward the kitchen. With a sigh, I continued.

“Before we proceed, I have one piece of information to share. The Golden Lion Clan has a new Secret Class user. And this user is someone I—and the kids—know very well.”

“Hyung, who is it?”

An-hyeon tilted his head and asked. I glanced at Lee Yu-jeong briefly before answering.

“I said it’s someone you all know. Think about it.”

“Huh? Someone we know… I can’t think of anyone.”

“Me neither, oraboni. Who is it?”

Just as I was about to respond to the siblings’ questions, a cold voice cut through.

“It’s Kim Han-byeol.”

It wasn’t An-hyeon who spoke. I slowly turned my head toward the source of the voice.
