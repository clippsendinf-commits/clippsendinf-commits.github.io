# Memorize - Chapter 107: Same Question, Different Result

But we were only halfway there. With half the journey still ahead, letting my guard down was not an option. I spoke in a quiet voice.

“It’s a bit awkward to explain in detail… but to put it simply, the angels only know about it. The angel assigned to me was strongly against me using or accepting this power at the time.”

“Then how in the world did you acquire that power…?” 

Jeong Ha-yeon started to ask but then closed her mouth. She seemed deeply curious about how I obtained a power that even the angels opposed. However, since we had already verified the truth through the *Crystal of Truth* and I had implied it was obtained through legitimate means, there was little room for her to dig further.

Jeong Ha-yeon’s lips were dry and parched. She moistened them with her tongue before speaking again.

“Then, may I know why the angels opposed it? If they opposed a power obtained legitimately, there must be a reason. Angels are supposed to guide users in *Hall Plane* to follow the right path, after all.”

She had asked the right question. This was where it began.

“It’s… it’s not a big deal.”

At that moment, the crystal orb I was holding flared up vividly for the first time. Seeing the change in the *Crystal of Truth*, the party members all looked at me with strange expressions. I avoided Jeong Ha-yeon’s gaze, staring at the floor, but this was all part of the plan.

Of course, I could have said, “Honestly, I don’t want to talk about this in front of everyone,” or “I don’t want to answer.” But even those responses might cause the *Crystal of Truth*’s flame to flicker, as they could be interpreted as evasive. I was deliberately leading Jeong Ha-yeon to ask a specific question, and if I gave such answers, they might be deemed lies.

As expected, Jeong Ha-yeon’s eyes narrowed further. Like a fisherman watching a fish about to take the bait, I looked at her with nervous anticipation.

“The *Crystal of Truth* changed. You lied.”

“…There’s a reason.”

“You allowed me to ask this question in the first place. If you hadn’t, I wouldn’t have pressed, but please answer. Don’t disappoint me any further. Or else…”

“…”

I remained silent. Seeing my expression, Jeong Ha-yeon paused and bit her lip.

“I can’t forget the kindness you showed us on the first day, Soo-hyun. How could I forget the person who saved our lives? The way you treated the kids and led the caravan was the epitome of an ideal leader. You said you got an offer from the *Golden Lion Clan*, right? So did I. And I left them. But watching you and the kids together shook me deeply. It felt like… like a family, something you don’t see in *Hall Plane*.”

Her way of addressing me had shifted from “User Kim Soo-hyun” and “you” back to “Soo-hyun.” I quietly waited for her to continue.

“I envied that, and it gave me a thrilling sense of expectation. But… was that expectation just mine? Was it just my foolish hope?”

Jeong Ha-yeon was now almost pleading. But I decided to pause a bit longer.

“This power…”

I opened my mouth slightly, then closed it again. In my mind, I carefully chose my words. The power of *Hwa-jeong* undeniably carried great risks. That was an undeniable truth. At that moment, I felt a pang of doubt. I might be able to handle it now, but if situations like this kept piling up, I couldn’t predict how things would turn out.

I knew what the right choice was. Investing all my remaining points into my stamina stat was the rational decision. But the lingering attachment to reaching 101 points was overwhelming. In the ten years of *Hall Plane*, only two users were known to have reached 101 points in any stat, and both had made a name for themselves as legends of their time.

If I invested eight of my current points, I could raise both my agility and magic stats to 101. But the higher my stats climbed, the greater the backlash on my body. My reason told me to boost stamina, but my emotions pulled me toward agility and magic. Frustration welled up, and I let out a heavy sigh.

I shook my head vigorously. What was I even thinking about in a moment like this?

Feeling guilty, I looked up and saw Jeong Ha-yeon’s face, steeped in disappointment. She must have misinterpreted my troubled expression and sigh.

“It was just my expectation, wasn’t it… Fine. I’ll take my hand off the *Crystal of Truth*—”

I cut her off, speaking quickly.

“This power is so immense that it’s not something a human can handle.”

As I interrupted, she stopped speaking. The moment I finally let it out, a hush fell over the group, as if even their breathing had ceased. Jeong Ha-yeon tilted her head, mulling over my words.

“That doesn’t make sense. A power humans can’t handle… What…?”

“But it’s true that it’s currently dormant within my body.”

Her gaze naturally drifted to the crystal orb. I could see shock spreading across her face.

“No way…!”

“…Sigh. Yes. This power is not meant for humans to wield.”

Her eyes widened, and her mouth slowly opened. She raised her right hand to cover it, unable to hide her astonishment. As expected of her sharp mind, she seemed to be piecing together what would come next.

I really didn’t want to say it, but I spoke as if I had no choice.

“Yes. For certain reasons, the power dormant in my body is a double-edged sword. When I activate it, I gain immense strength, but it comes with tremendous risks. You saw the state I was in when you found me. Every time I draw on this power, it causes a massive backlash in my body. That’s why I lost consciousness.”

The party stared at me, utterly stunned. But I wasn’t done yet. I needed to steer the conversation further.

“The angel in charge opposed it because they believed this power could one day kill me. But I… I had no choice but to accept it. There were reasons I had to.”

Of course, those reasons involved the *Grand Duke of Hell*. To counter the *Hellfire* he wielded, there was no flame better than *Hwa-jeong*.

Jeong Ha-yeon stared at me blankly before lowering her gaze to the *Crystal of Truth*. The flame inside had returned to a faint glow, burning quietly. Seeing it, I allowed myself a subtle smile inwardly.

I glanced at Jeong Ha-yeon and the others’ expressions. The bait had been firmly taken. Now, it was just a matter of timing to reel it in.

I could hear the kids muttering something nearby, but I ignored it for now. I kept my eyes fixed on Jeong Ha-yeon, maintaining a calm gaze. She, in turn, seemed desperate to avoid my eyes. It was the first time since the expedition that I saw her so shaken. My words had clearly struck a chord.

Just then, I felt a tug at my sleeve and turned my head.

“Oppa…”

An-sol had crawled over, trembling as she looked at me. The kids and Vivian behind her looked equally at a loss. Shin Sang-yong stood there with his mouth agape, looking foolish. Seeing their faces, I felt a slight urge to tease them.

With a sad smile, I nodded as if to say I was fine. But the moment I did, tears welled up in An-sol’s eyes. Startled, I quickly dropped the act. This kid was too scared to even speak.

“Ha…”

A sigh mixed with a gasp came from the front. I turned to see Jeong Ha-yeon holding her face in her hands. She must have been overwhelmed. She probably wanted to say, “I can’t believe it,” but the *Crystal of Truth* confirmed my words were true.

“So… how… if that’s true, I mean, it is true…”

She was muttering incoherently, her head seemingly spinning. Come to think of it, she mentioned leaving the *Golden Lion Clan*. What had she gone through there? Seeing her more shaken than I expected, a small spark of curiosity flickered in me.

But I pushed that curiosity aside for now. This was a critical moment.

Realizing her own disarray, Jeong Ha-yeon lowered her hands and rested her chin on one of them. Her eyes were closed, her lips tightly pressed together, deep in thought. She was likely trying to process my words and organize her thoughts.

Time passed. None of the party members dared to speak. This was fine by me. After a while, she opened her eyes and let the hand supporting her chin drop limply to the ground.

Her face was now tinged with exhaustion. She met my gaze briefly before speaking in a weary voice, lacking the clear strength she had before.

“If it’s not rude, I’d like to ask one more thing.”

“I thought pulling out the *Crystal of Truth* was rude enough already. And it’s still active. One or two more questions won’t change much.”

Her face stiffened at my sharp tone. But everything I said was true. Plus, she now held some of my personal information. If Jeong Ha-yeon couldn’t offer something equivalent in return, I’d have at least a minimal justification to deal with her discreetly.

“…You’re right. Everything you’ve said so far has been true. I don’t know what’s in your heart, and I shouldn’t have doubted you so recklessly… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”

“Words once spoken can’t be taken back.”

“You’re right. It’s water already spilled. I still have so many questions, but I probably don’t have the right to know. Even so, there’s one thing I’m still curious about. It’s partly a public question but also a personal curiosity. I know it’s shameless, but please allow me this one last question. If you answer, I’ll break the *Crystal of Truth* myself.”

A public question but also a personal curiosity. That likely ruled out it being about Jeong Ji-yeon. I nodded once, expressionless.

“Go ahead. I’ll hear you out.”

“Soo-hyun.”

The moment I gave permission, Jeong Ha-yeon spoke immediately.

“…Why do you keep trying to sacrifice yourself?”

“...!”

At that moment, Kim Han-byeol’s face seemed to overlap with Jeong Ha-yeon’s. The conversations we had in the cabin flooded back into my mind.

*“Stop it. Why do you keep doing this, oppa?”*

*“And why do you try so hard to hide it?”*

*“Does that mean you’re someone I can trust?”*

Kim Han-byeol had said those things and left me. And if my guess was right, I was now hearing a similar question.

She wasn’t done yet. Jeong Ha-yeon continued.

“You said it’s a power that damages your body the more you use it. Then you shouldn’t overuse it. Just now, with the *Demonic Beings*… sure, you handled it alone. But given the circumstances, couldn’t we have fought together? Did you really have to use that power, risking your life, all by yourself?”

“That’s…”

“I know it’s a sacrificial act, driven by some kind of resolve. But this is *Hall Plane*. You know what kind of place this is. You’re so capable of taking care of yourself, so why do you act this way for the kids, for us? What are you hoping for? What’s your intention, your purpose, that makes you willingly sacrifice so much? Please… answer me…”

Her desperate tone made me let out a soft groan. But inside, I smiled faintly. I felt a wave of relief wash over me. The question Jeong Ha-yeon had just asked was exactly the one I’d been hoping for.

Everyone was looking at me with burning eyes. Savoring their gazes, I slowly opened my mouth.
