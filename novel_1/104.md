# Memorize - Chapter 103: Don’t Touch My Oppa

I pressed down hard on the creature’s head with my foot, applying steady force. There was a slight resistance, a faint hardness, but as I pushed harder, I could feel Belphegor’s skull crumpling beneath my sole. My foot sank deeper, grinding the creature’s head until it finally touched the floor. When I lifted my foot slightly after a couple of twists, I saw the mangled remnants of what had once been its head.

With a soft exhale, I took a moment to savor the sight before bending down and reaching toward its chest. Even as my hand pressed against its left side, Belphegor showed no signs of movement. No breath. To all appearances, it was completely dead. Keeping my expression calm, I thrust my hand inside.

*Thud!*

The sensation of piercing through tough, leathery flesh, harder than human skin, was unmistakable. Looking at Belphegor, whose chest I had just torn open, I spoke in a mocking tone.

“Guess I broke those horns for nothing. Kind of a shame… but oh well, you summoned Skrep, so I’d say it’s a fair trade, wouldn’t you, Belphegor?”

Naturally, there was no response. I rummaged around inside its chest for a while until my fingers closed around something solid. A deep smile spread across my face. *There it is.* Pausing near its heart, I gripped tightly and yanked it out with force. Yet, even with its heart—or what passed for it—ripped out, Belphegor remained motionless.

Holding the dark, glistening orb, slick with inky blue blood, I let out a satisfied chuckle.

“Heh. As expected from a high-tier demon—something like this comes up. Well, sword or heart, I’ll make good use of them. So long, Belphegor.”

After a casual farewell, I turned to leave but then paused, spinning back around. I plopped down in front of its body.

“That’s harsh. I said I’d use it well and even gave you a proper goodbye. The least you could do is see me off.”

Silence. I sighed and reached back into its split chest.

“…”

“Don’t play dead. I know you’re still alive.”

At that moment, I felt a faint tremor ripple through Belphegor’s body. I didn’t miss it. Grinning broadly at the reaction, I unleashed a surge of mana infused with Hwajeong into its chest.

“If you thought I’d just walk away, you miscalculated.”

*Whoosh!*

A clear flame ignited from within, quickly spreading to consume Belphegor’s entire body. Black smoke began to billow out, and I laughed aloud at the sight.

“Haha! Sneaky bastard. I’ve got your tricks figured out.”

*Keergh… Keeraaagh…*

The black smoke wailed with resentment, but I merely watched with amusement. In moments, Hwajeong’s pure flames had devoured Belphegor’s body entirely and began to spread to the lingering smoke in the air.

*Kiaa… Kiaaa…*

I propped my chin on one hand, observing the process calmly. Who was it that insisted on coming to Mul? Taking down Belphegor today would be a massive step toward my ultimate goal of returning to the Hall Plane. Watching the smoke fade within Hwajeong’s radiant flames until not a trace remained, I felt a refreshing clarity. The Belphegor I’d clashed with through a long, bitter feud in my first cycle was now utterly eradicated, soul and all. Just to be sure, I activated my Third Eye to scan the spot where it had been. When no information appeared, I flashed a triumphant smile.

Then, I collapsed backward onto the ground, savoring the emotions welling up inside me. Who said revenge was empty? This was sweet, exhilarating. For the first time in a while, I felt happiness flood through me, and I wore a contented expression.

As the tension holding me together released and relief washed over me, a sharp dizziness hit. The cost of using Hwajeong with my low stamina came crashing down. I’d been pushing my body and mana to their limits since the third floor, relying on my latent ability *Cannot Fall*, sheer willpower, and years of pent-up vengeance to keep going.

“Haa…”

But it was fine. More than fine—I was elated. Even my breath felt sweet. I tucked Belphegor’s heart into my coat and reached toward where I’d kicked the sword earlier.

*Whoosh, snap.*

“Well, well.”

As if it had been waiting, something flew through the air and landed perfectly in my palm. It was the magic sword, Skrep, which Belphegor had summoned but never got the chance to swing due to my quick reaction. I chuckled at the sword’s behavior.

“Heh. Don’t you think you’re switching masters a bit too quickly? Even if Belphegor’s dead…”

*Hummm.*

As if it understood, Skrep vibrated in my hand. What a funny guy. A sword like Skrep would be incredibly useful even in the later stages of the Hall Plane, so I decided to keep it. Perhaps sensing my intent—or pleading not to be discarded—Skrep let out another sticky hum.

“Alright, alright. I wasn’t planning to use you myself anyway. I’ll find you a good master, so just be patient.”

Muttering in an annoyed tone, I felt the sword’s vibrations stop. A sword acting cute—what a world. It wasn’t strange for a magic sword to have a will of its own, but they usually didn’t pick masters so readily. I tilted my head but, since it wasn’t a bad thing, tucked Skrep into my coat as well.

All I could see was the faded, worn ceiling. A reluctance to get up washed over me. My party was likely still waiting on the third floor. Knowing them, they might have come looking for me. I considered standing, but the urge to just sleep was strong. This wasn’t mere drowsiness—my body was screaming for rest under the strain of the backlash. Still, with Belphegor dealt with, the Ruined Laboratory was effectively cleared. Tilting my head slightly, I saw the first-floor rooms we’d entered initially.

Before being bombarded by my techniques on the third floor, Belphegor had used its signature Dark Assimilation to escape. But knowing it couldn’t leave the laboratory, I’d tracked it with my detection skills. Before pursuing, I’d noticed my party, safe within a protective barrier.

“I’ll handle the chase alone. Everyone, stay here.”

They’d shouted something at me, but I had no time to listen. With a single curt order, I’d bolted down the stairs. Using my Third Eye, I confirmed Belphegor was on the first floor. Rushing down, I found it frantically sweeping the floor in one of the rooms, as if trying to escape somewhere. Was there a secret passage? I’d have to check that before leaving.

A list of tasks began to form in my mind, but explanations were probably the most urgent. I planned to reveal my abilities through a clan application as soon as we returned to Mul, though that moment had come a bit early. Jeong Ha-yeon’s face flashed in my mind. Discussing things with her wouldn’t be easy. I chuckled at the thought.

Ultimately, I decided to rest for now. There was no need to rush—these things would come naturally. More importantly, my body felt heavy as soaked cotton. I resolved to seriously consider reallocating points to stamina soon. Clearing my mind, I closed my eyes, feeling a gentle darkness settle over me.

---

How much time had passed? It wasn’t exactly a restful sleep—more like a forced blackout. Still, the dizziness was gone, so I slowly opened my eyes. My vision was shrouded in darkness.

Even after blinking, the darkness persisted. At the same time, I felt something soft and warm against my head and cheek—something unfamiliar. Curious, I rubbed my face against it, feeling it shift slightly. It wasn’t unpleasant, so I pressed my cheek against it again, exhaling deeply.

“Hnng…!”

A soft, suggestive moan reached my ears, and the soft surface beneath my head quivered again. Suddenly, whatever was covering my eyes lifted, and a cool sensation touched my forehead. I snapped awake. Looking up, I locked eyes with a woman with short, glossy hair and a clear, radiant face. It was Jeong Ha-yeon.

For a moment, we stared at each other. I pieced together the situation: I’d passed out, my party had found me, and Jeong Ha-yeon was tending to me, with my head resting on her lap. That much made sense.

Two things puzzled me. First, why was Jeong Ha-yeon the one giving me a lap pillow when there were others in the party? Second, why was my head nestled so deeply into her robe, resting against the inside of her thigh?

Seeking answers, I spoke calmly.

“Hello.”

“…”

“This is quite comfortable.”

Noticing my unusual tone, Jeong Ha-yeon seemed to pick up on my thoughts. She took a breath through her delicate nose and spoke.

“Let me clarify something.”

Her voice was crystal clear. She moved her hand from my forehead to the back of my head, applying slight pressure—a signal to get up.

“It wasn’t my intention for you to end up *there*. You burrowed in on your own.”

Mulling over her words, I responded evenly.

“Hm. Couldn’t you have just pulled my naughty head out?”

“No matter how many times I pulled it out or repositioned you, you kept burrowing back in. I gave up after the seventh try and your eighth attempt. Congratulations on your persistence.”

There was a subtle edge to her words. At a loss for a response, I apologized quickly and tried to sit up. But as I did, my strength gave out, and I lost my balance. The world tilted 90 degrees, and I began to fall backward.

*Thump, squish.*

Jeong Ha-yeon caught me swiftly, pulling me into her arms. Unintentionally, I ended up nestled against her chest again. The softness against the back of my head left me speechless. Her chest was surprisingly… substantial.

“…Like this.”

“I was willing to believe you until just now, but this situation isn’t helping your case.”

Though her tone was sharp, it didn’t feel truly angry. I managed to sit up, planting my hips on the floor. I nearly blurted out, *Then why give me a lap pillow in the first place?* but held my tongue, sensing it might actually upset her.

Her perception was sharper than I expected.

“Let me add one more thing. I did volunteer to look after you, yes. But I had no choice.”

“Why’s that?”

“I couldn’t trust An-sol or Yu-jeong with it—they’re too unreliable.”

Jeong Ha-yeon finished with a bitter smile. One convenience of talking with her was that we didn’t need to spell everything out, much like with Kim Han-byeol.

The situation was the same now. Our conversation was light, a preamble to the real discussion. From her reactions since I’d woken up, I could tell she was being considerate. Her subtle words helped me understand and accept the situation.

I scratched my head a couple of times and surveyed the room. It seemed they’d brought me into one of the first-floor rooms, meaning we hadn’t left the Ruined Laboratory yet. I’d worried they might have carried me back to Mul while I was out, but thankfully, that wasn’t the case. Returning without checking the secret passage would be a waste.

The other party members were nowhere in sight. I extended my detection briefly before turning to Jeong Ha-yeon.

“Where are the others?”

“Third floor. It’s mostly ashes up there, but they’re checking if there’s anything worth salvaging.”

Her clear reply prompted a soft groan from me. Gathering my strength, I stood up. Unlike before, I managed to stand steadily, my mind clearer. I felt Jeong Ha-yeon’s gaze sharpen as she watched.

“…I’m fine.”

“I suppose so. An-sol practically spammed healing spells on you.”

“Haa.”

I took a deep breath and checked my condition. I hadn’t been out for too long, it seemed. As I moved my body to assess myself further, I heard multiple footsteps approaching from beyond the door. They grew closer, and I instinctively steadied myself.

I turned to look at Jeong Ha-yeon. She gazed back with a calm expression, but her eyes held a deep, quiet intensity.
