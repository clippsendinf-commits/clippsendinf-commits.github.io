# Chapter 49: Dungeon of Alchemist

The moment I heard the word "shadow," I was utterly shocked. I stared at the user nestled in my arms, my face aghast. Unlike moments ago, they now gazed at me with a calm expression and serene eyes. That tranquil gaze sent an inexplicable chill down my spine.

Instinctively, I tried to move my shadow, but a surge of fear welling up from deep within stopped me. A cold sensation brushed against the nape of my neck. Their arms, wrapped around me, and their hand had somehow reached my neck.

I’m going to die.

In a life-or-death moment, I didn’t waste time on foolish questions like *why* or *how*. My sharp instincts, which had kept me alive until now, were warning me more clearly than ever. The instant I moved my shadow, the user rubbing their face against my chest would, without hesitation, snap my neck and twist it.

I felt the strength slowly draining from my arms as I held them.

The woman’s arms fell limply to her sides. Her technique had been somewhat studied during the first cycle, so I had been on guard for her shadow. But even knowing about it, I couldn’t afford to let my guard down around a user like her. I was ready to twist her neck at the slightest hint of trouble.

Yet, she didn’t push her luck. Acknowledging her misjudgment, she took a step back. Her innate instincts were sharp, and she didn’t overestimate her abilities.

I found myself growing fonder of her. The woman before me knew when to retreat. Realizing I didn’t need to deal with her right now, I slowly activated my Third Eye. This time, I wanted to know everything about her.

Seeing Go Yeon-ju’s stats and abilities, I couldn’t help but let out a sigh of admiration. Her total stat points amounted to 536 out of a possible 600—just four points shy of mine. It was no wonder she would later claim a spot among the Ten Strongest.

Still, I was confident I could defeat her. Except for stamina, all my stats surpassed hers. When factoring in the level and rank of my unique, special, and potential abilities, I was certain I could overwhelm her.

So, I made up my mind right then and there. Once I finished my business in Mul, I would decide what to do with Go Yeon-ju. I’d try to recruit her, but if that didn’t work… My thoughts must have shown on my face because I saw her flinch as she looked into my eyes. I quickly composed my expression and spoke in a quiet voice.

“Shadows are fond of beautiful women. That’s why they like you.”

“…”

“So…”

Go Yeon-ju remained silent, her face still stiff. Now, I was the one gently caressing her face. The reversal of our earlier situation sent a strange thrill coursing through me.

“I’d prefer if you didn’t try anything reckless.”

A user like Go Yeon-ju would understand the meaning behind my words. When I saw her nod faintly, I finally pulled my face away from her embrace.

Her current state of mind seemed quite complex. The usual relaxed expression was gone, replaced by eyes filled with complicated emotions that spoke volumes about her feelings. Then, with a deep sigh, she spoke.

“I understand what you mean. My lips are sealed.”

“Good. I like women who keep their mouths shut.”

Go Yeon-ju, who had switched to polite speech, gave a wry smile at my words.

“I was just genuinely curious. I didn’t mean any harm, so please don’t misunderstand.”

“I’d like to tell you, but circumstances being what they are…”

I wanted to add that her Lure Eyed, no matter how well-intentioned, was a form of mental manipulation, but I decided to leave it at that for now.

At my indirect refusal, Go Yeon-ju looked disappointed but cautiously rose from her seat. With a glance, I signaled her to leave, and she quietly moved toward the door without protest.

As morning arrived, the kids began waking up one by one, rubbing sleepy eyes. Seeing them yawn and immediately start practicing their detection skills filled me with pride. Normally, I’d encourage such diligence, but today we had plans to leave the city, so I called the three of them to my room.

“What’s this about?” An-hyeon mumbled, yawning widely.

Yu-jeong made a disgusted face, and An-sol looked embarrassed. I chuckled at An-hyeon’s state and continued calmly.

“It seems like you’ve all gotten the hang of magic detection to some extent.”

Since I’d been stingy with praise until now, the kids blinked and exchanged glances. Then, they sheepishly straightened up, some even coughing awkwardly. It was quite a sight. A faint smile crept onto my lips, but I managed to hold it back.

“I’ve noticed how hard you’ve all been training this past week. Good work.”

“Hyung, does that mean…?”

An-hyeon’s voice trembled with excitement, and I nodded calmly. Today was the day we’d finally leave the city.

“Yes, I think it’s time to head out. It’s about time we got moving.”

The moment I gave my approval, a silent commotion broke out among An-hyeon, An-sol, and Yu-jeong. The realization that they were about to take their first real steps into the Hall Plane brought a vivid spark to their faces.

“But listen carefully. Training is something you should make a habit of, except in unavoidable circumstances.”

I added this to temper their excitement, but seeing them nod halfheartedly, their minds already elsewhere, I decided not to press further. I wondered if they’d still be this thrilled after facing the events outside the city.

The Ruined Laboratory or the Dungeon of the Ancient Alchemist Vivian? After some thought, I decided the dungeon was the better choice. Both were similarly difficult, but the Alchemist’s Dungeon, for which I had more clues, seemed more likely to yield success.

To reach Vivian’s dungeon, we’d need to exit through Mul’s north gate and venture deep into the Black Forest. The Black Forest, situated between the Northern Continent and uncharted territory, was far from tame. Even Barbara had only stabilized its early and middle sections. Beyond the forest’s midpoint, it was essentially uncharted land.

But that didn’t matter to me. I’d participated in expeditions to uncharted regions before, so I didn’t see the need to hire a ranger. For now, I decided against forming a caravan. More people meant dividing the rewards, and I was already stretched thin providing for the kids. I didn’t have the resources to worry about others.

Watching An-hyeon and An-sol excitedly hold hands and chant, I pulled out a bag—a magical backpack enchanted with a weight-reduction spell. A permanent one was too expensive, so I’d bought one with a week-long enchantment. By selling some of the rewards from this expedition and combining them with my current gold, I wouldn’t have to worry about money in Mul for a while.

“I’ve got a gift for all of you who’ve been training so hard.”

At the word “gift,” the kids’ curiosity immediately shifted to the backpack. They’d learned about magical backpacks at the User Academy, but seeing one up close was a first. Their eyes sparkled like children awaiting Santa Claus’s gifts, especially An-hyeon’s, which were practically gleaming, making me feel a bit overwhelmed.

Under their expectant gazes, I sweated a bit and reached into the backpack, carefully pulling out the gifts. They were weapons, chosen and ordered with care after observing their training at the academy.

One long spear. Two daggers. One wooden staff.

“Oh.”

“Huh?”

“Wow…”

Seeing the weapons laid out on the floor, An-hyeon, Yu-jeong, and An-sol let out gasps in turn. When I gestured for them to take them, they eagerly rushed forward. An-hyeon had mentioned GP before, but I’d told him to save it. There was no need to waste money on unnecessary purchases.

An-hyeon picked up the spear, thrust it into the air a few times, and looked satisfied. His form was decent, suggesting it felt natural in his hands.

“Wow, this feels great. It sticks to my hand every time I thrust.”

Contrary to my initial expectations, An-hyeon’s spearmanship had taken a different path. I’d thought he’d focus on slashing if he used a sword, but he’d been concentrating on thrusting techniques. So, I chose a spear with a pointed tip, shaped like a long spear.

“Your spearmanship is geared toward thrusting rather than slashing. That’s why I picked a spear with a sharpened point. It’s a long spear, not meant for throwing. It’s designed to give you reach, so you’ll need to focus on maintaining distance in combat. Defense is up to you.”

“Hyung, I can’t believe you thought of me like that… You’re making this awkward.”

An-hyeon’s touched expression and silly comment made me turn away. He laughed, clearly joking. Yu-jeong, who had been fiddling with her daggers, jumped into the conversation like a sidekick as soon as An-hyeon and I finished.

“Oppa, what about me? These daggers only have one edge.”

“That’s how I ordered them. Oh, Yu-jeong, yours are custom-made…”

“Really?”

Yu-jeong’s face lit up at the mention of custom work, cutting me off.

“Your daggers are based on a katana, a Japanese sword. The blade is longer than a typical dagger—about half the length of a standard katana.”

“Hmm, it feels a bit awkward, but I think I’ll get used to it. It might be better.”

“Mercenaries specialize in close-quarters combat. Try them out. Finding a weapon that suits you is part of your training.”

“Okay. But, oppa, aren’t custom-made weapons more expensive than regular ones?”

“Of course. Why do you ask?”

When I nodded simply, Yu-jeong flashed a smug smile and turned to An-hyeon. Twirling her dagger with a boastful grin, it was clear what she was up to without asking. She then turned back to me.

“So, my gift is the most expensive, right? Hohoho. Come on, oppa, just admit it. Why beat around the bush?”

An-hyeon looked exasperated as he listened to Yu-jeong. An-sol sent me a glance that screamed unfairness. I was the one who should feel wronged, but these kids were predictably childish. I’d anticipated this kind of drama, so I stared at Yu-jeong with a pitying look. Her provocative wink, however, was more than I could handle.

I sighed and continued in a low voice.

“Unfortunately, the most expensive isn’t your daggers—it’s An-sol’s staff.”

“…What? Why? That measly wooden staff?”

Yu-jeong’s voice sank immediately. An-sol’s lips pursed at the “measly wooden staff” comment. I shrugged.

“Of course. Weapons for mages or priests are usually magical items.”

“Magic?”

An-sol’s eyes widened as she echoed the word. I nodded and explained the enchantment.

“Yes. It calms the wielder’s mind and improves mana control efficiency. It’s low-grade, so don’t expect miracles, but it’s better than nothing. You don’t need something to boost your mana capacity right now. It’s okay, right?”

“Yes!”

An-sol answered energetically, clearly delighted, and I gave her a small smile. For a moment, I thought how nice it would be to have such a sweet, adorable little sister.

It was brief, but I caught An-sol shooting a boastful glance at Yu-jeong. When I glanced at Yu-jeong, her face was slightly contorted, having noticed An-sol’s look.

I recalled hearing recently that An-sol had been acting smug. I’d dismissed it, thinking she wasn’t like that, but now I felt it might be worth reconsidering.
