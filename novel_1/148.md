# Memorize - Chapter 147: Cave of Screams (1)

The creatures were still sizing us up. We had formed a defensive formation. If the Ladolrofs came charging with full intent, their momentum would be overwhelming, so the key was to preemptively reduce their numbers as much as possible.

Of course, with just me, Go Yeon-ju, and Vivian, we could easily handle the Ladolrofs. In truth, even one of us alone would find them no more than a light workout. But we couldn’t keep doing this forever. So, I decided not to offer much help beyond dealing with the ones coming directly at me. It was time for the others to recognize their roles, experience the pain of injury, and understand the consequences of failing their tasks.

“───. ───. ───.”

“───. ───. ───.”

I could hear Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong chanting their spells. The Ladolrofs numbered roughly over thirty, with about twenty reacting swiftly to our intrusion. If those twenty charged with their horns lowered, they’d likely break through at least one part of our formation. The question was how many Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong could take down with their preemptive strikes. Then, it happened.

“Pwoosh! Pwoosh! Pwoosh!”

“Pururung! Pururung! Pururung!”

Most monsters in the Hall Plane possess some level of intelligence, and many are particularly sensitive to the flow of mana. As mages gather mana to cast spells, these creatures often react sharply. Sure enough, as the mana began to converge around our group, the Ladolrofs, sensing unease, let out rough snorts and labored breaths, thrusting their heads forward aggressively.

One or two doing this might be ignored, but when over twenty moved in unison, their intent was clear. With a deafening roar from an especially large one in the lead, they charged toward us all at once.

Dududu! Dudududu!

Kungkungkung! Kungkungkungkung!

The ground shook with their thundering steps, the sound growing sharper as their pace quickened. It was like a cavalry of medieval knights charging with heavy lances. I swung my sword lightly to gauge my defensive range, locking onto three Ladolrofs at the forefront. In a low voice, I warned the group.

“They’re coming. The first line will try to break our formation with a charge, while the second line uses their strong legs to trample us. If you can hold the first line without being pushed back—or better, push *them* back—the fight becomes much easier.”

When the distance between us and the Ladolrofs had halved, I heard heavy exhales from behind, signaling that the mages had completed their spells. Since we hadn’t formed our formation too close, the mages had enough time to prepare. Still, with the creatures’ speed increasing, I hoped they’d unleash their spells soon.

“Dig in the Ground!”

Surprisingly, it was Shin Sang-yong, not Jeong Ha-yeon, who cast the first spell, as if they’d coordinated beforehand. It wasn’t a direct attack spell, which caught me off guard, but knowing their preference for combo magic, I decided to observe. Using *Dig in the Ground* against Ladolrofs was, in fact, a highly effective choice.

An invisible force swept across the ground in front of the charging creatures. A moment later, a “thunk” sounded as the earth split, forming a long trench. Without mastery of advanced magic circuits, creating multiple pits simultaneously wasn’t possible, but the spell was cast at a perfectly timed location, too precise for the Ladolrofs to react.

The trench wasn’t terribly deep, but it was enough to trip them up. More importantly, the spell wasn’t cast haphazardly—it targeted the optimal moment for maximum effect, earning high marks in my book. The results were immediate.

“Puheheeng! Puheheheeng!”

“Pukrak! Pukkrak!”

Four or five Ladolrofs in the front line stumbled and fell, while others staggered heavily. Even those slightly behind, running at a distance, were forced to slow down, creating a wave of confusion. Seizing this chaos, Jeong Ha-yeon’s clear voice rang out.

“Ice Spear! Rapid Fire!”

Yesterday, the vagabond mage used *Flame Spear*, but since Ha-yeon specialized in water-based magic, she opted for *Ice Spear*. I quietly counted the spears forming and smiled inwardly with satisfaction. Likely due to her special ability, *Blessing of the Lake*, she conjured and launched six spears without expending full effort. The spears, fired with slight delays, targeted the fallen Ladolrofs, striking their bodies cleanly as they couldn’t dodge amidst the chaos.

Painful screams echoed from the Ladolrofs, but Ha-yeon’s magic wasn’t done. Normally, a single spell carries one effect, as combining two is incredibly difficult due to the complexity of magic circuits. But she still had her trump card: *Memorize*. A white glow shimmered from her *Necklace of Glory* as she opened her mouth again to cast another spell.

“Broken!”

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

As the *Broken* spell activated, the ice spears lodged in the Ladolrofs shattered instantly. The external ice turned into fragments, whipping through the surrounding enemies like a storm. Judging by how some Ladolrofs twisted violently and collapsed, the spears embedded inside likely broke into tiny pieces, shredding their insides.

“…I’m sorry. The power was weaker than I expected.”

“No, this is more than enough.”

Seeing Jeong Ha-yeon apologize in a dejected tone, I shook my head. The six Ladolrofs hit by the spears were dead, and those nearby staggered, still charging despite their injuries. While she hadn’t halved their numbers as I’d hoped, she’d significantly disrupted their charge and inflicted numerous wounds. It didn’t meet my high expectations, but it was far from something to apologize for. (Admittedly, my expectations were a bit lofty.)

At that moment, I felt a strange flow of mana weaving intricate patterns nearby. Seeing a magic circle form with swirling smoke, I realized I’d overlooked another member of our group. We had one more mage—an alchemist far superior to the other two.

“Arise, Acacia! Queen of Pain, ruler of the 29th Legion!”

Vivian’s resonant voice rang out, and dark flowers bloomed from the trench Shin Sang-yong had created. The flowers, blossoming at incredible speed, unraveled their vines, enveloping nearby Ladolrofs. After confirming the scene, Vivian snapped her fingers with flair.

*Snap!*

Pssht! Pssht! Pssht!

“““““Puheheheheheeng!”””””

Sharp thorns extended from the vines, mercilessly piercing the ensnared Ladolrofs. Those caught in the vines’ range screamed in agony, raising their heads, only to be buried again under a fresh wave of thorns. Six more Ladolrofs fell to the thorns. Those outside the range or quick enough to leap away survived, but the combined efforts of the three mages had taken down twelve before they even reached us. Glancing back, Vivian flashed a V-sign and grinned. I sighed and clicked my tongue. She frowned and muttered at my reaction.

The large Ladolrof that had roared first was still alive, bearing wounds but undeterred in its hostility. It lowered its four-horned head and charged again. Enraged by its kin’s deaths, the surviving Ladolrofs followed, horns forward.

The mages had done their part. Now it was time for the melee fighters. With their numbers reduced, I decided to adjust our formation slightly and spoke up.

“An-hyeon! Yu-jeong! Move forward!”

At my command, An-hyeon and Yu-jeong quickly took positions to my left and right. I didn’t give Go Yeon-ju specific orders; her role was to protect the mages and priest while providing occasional support from the rear.

The lead Ladolrof charged at me with a bellowing roar. Its horns gleamed sharply in the sunlight as it lunged. I stepped back, raising my sword vertically and striking upward. I felt resistance as the blade sliced through, sending horn fragments flying. The force lifted the creature’s head, and I delivered a powerful kick to its jaw.

A heavy impact reverberated through my foot, and the monster’s neck whipped back as it stumbled a few steps. Seizing the moment, An-hyeon and Yu-jeong attacked its sides.

*Thud! Slash!*

An-hyeon’s spear pierced its torso, while Yu-jeong’s katana sliced into its right leg. Her cut, lacking enough force, stopped halfway through the leg. As she paused, another Ladolrof charged at her.

“Yah!”

Yu-jeong wasn’t idle during her training. Reversing her grip on the katana, she pulled herself toward me, using her body’s momentum to deepen the cut. With her left hand, she swung *Skrep* at the incoming monster.

“Puheung!”

“Kyaa!”

Unable to fully evade, Yu-jeong’s body shook violently, nearly falling. But using her katana as a brace, she barely held on. The charging Ladolrof, struck by *Skrep* in the head, let out a pained scream.

Yu-jeong wasn’t unscathed—her left arm was bent awkwardly, yet she clung to *Skrep*. I chose not to intervene. She’d done better than merely dodging, and her steady posture suggested she’d anticipated the hit.

“Cure!”

An-sol, prepared in advance, cast a holy spell on Yu-jeong’s arm. A warm white light enveloped it, and after rotating her healed arm a couple of times, Yu-jeong stood again.

An-hyeon was performing beyond expectations, holding off three Ladolrofs. He seemed to be struggling but didn’t retreat, enduring their attacks. His focus on martial arts paid off as he dodged their horns with twists and swung his heavy spear like a windmill, striking them repeatedly. Though he took hits from stray kicks, he gritted his teeth, fulfilling his role as a tank.

“Shackles!”

“Shield!”

“Wind Cutter!”

Support from the priest and mages continued, making the battle smoother. I casually struck a Ladolrof’s gaping maw as it lunged, then focused on the leader. Yu-jeong had cleverly bound its right leg, slowing it down, allowing me to sever its neck with ease.

As time passed, more Ladolrofs fell to the ground. After I beheaded the leader, their morale plummeted. With support from Go Yeon-ju and Vivian, Yu-jeong fought more fiercely, while An-hyeon, backed by An-sol and Jeong Ha-yeon, took down all three of his opponents.

*Thud!*

Yu-jeong finished the last monster, crossing *Skrep* and her dagger to slit its throat before turning away. Her jacket and shirt were slightly torn on the left, but she appeared unharmed. For the first time, I had no complaints about a melee fight led by the kids. That meant they’d met my baseline expectations.

In less than six months, these novices had held their ground against a decently strong monster horde. Though the mages’ early strikes and support from me and Go Yeon-ju helped, they’d each done their part admirably. The group, perhaps feeling the novelty of their success, stared at me quietly.

But I had no intention of praising them here. I was still hungry for more, and they needed to grow to the point of crushing these creatures like bugs. With an impassive gaze, I looked ahead.

The young and their protectors had vanished from the area, fleeing the moment their fighting force was wiped out. Seeing the group hesitate, I shook my head calmly.

“We won’t pursue the ones that fled. They’re hard to catch, and there’s no need. Treat the injured with potions quickly and reform the ranks. We resume marching in three minutes.”

“““Yes.”””

Hearing their slightly deflated voices, I turned around calmly. Go Yeon-ju, for some reason, kept wearing a faint smile.
