# Chapter 23: The City of Traps

After the meeting, I followed An-hyeon’s lead to check on An-sol’s condition. Seeing her sleeping soundly on a single mat, a pang of pity tugged at my heart. I placed a hand on her forehead to probe her internal state, and as expected, her mana was in disarray. It wasn’t too severe, and with time, her body’s natural recovery would likely restore balance. Still, I decided to lend a hand.

“It’d be best if someone stayed with An-sol tonight to keep an eye on her,” I said.

“I’ll do it,” An-hyeon volunteered immediately.

I shook my head at his predictable response. Glancing out the window, I saw the world outside had already fallen into complete darkness. An-hyeon’s eyes were heavy with exhaustion. The day had drained everyone’s mental strength considerably. He was holding on through sheer willpower, but I couldn’t let that compromise tomorrow’s plans.

“You look exhausted. Go get some rest. I’ll watch her for now.”

“Aren’t you going to sleep, hyung?”

“Later. Let the girls rest well tonight. You and I can take turns watching An-sol. I’ll wake you when it’s time to switch.”

“Oh, taking shifts. That works. Please take care of my sister, hyung.”

I nodded in response. An-hyeon staggered out, closing the door behind him. I could tell he was barely holding back his need for sleep, though there were still things I wanted to ask him. Those could wait for a quieter moment. My head was already tangled with thoughts about the trap point and the group’s dynamics, so I figured I’d sort through them while tending to An-sol. But first, there was work to do.

Once I confirmed the door was securely closed, I calmly summoned my mana. A faint vermilion glow began to shimmer around my right hand, like ripples spreading across still water. I extended my hand, placing it gently over the center of An-sol’s chest, and projected my mana into her. Since I was helping her recover, I figured I might as well add a little extra care.

Correcting mana that’s severely backfired or tangled in the body’s circuits can be a hassle. But calming overdriven mana and untangling its flow was relatively straightforward. As my pure fire-attributed mana flowed into her, An-sol’s body twitched slightly.

Mana takes on different properties based on a person’s disposition. An-sol’s mana, as I sensed it, was pure and radiant, glowing with a white light. At first, it seemed startled by the influx of my overwhelming mana, hesitating and wavering uneasily. I softened my approach, enveloping her mana gently, as if to reassure it: *It’s okay. I’m here to help. Be calm.* Coaxing her mana with a soothing touch, I felt it gradually recognize my intent. Soon, it began to flock toward my mana, drawn to its warmth.

Careful not to startle her mana further, I guided it with finesse, cradling it tenderly. Her mana seemed to respond playfully, almost as if vying for attention, rubbing against mine. I couldn’t help but find it endearing. As I worked through her entire body, stabilizing the agitated areas and untangling the knotted flows, her face took on a faint flush. Her expression softened, serene—perhaps she was dreaming something pleasant.

There was one small hitch. When I tried to withdraw my mana after scanning her body, An-sol’s mana clung to it, as if pleading for me to stay and nurture it a bit longer. It tugged at me insistently, but I gently disentangled myself and finally caught my breath.

The task took about an hour. I’d meant to finish quickly, but my meticulous care and efforts to boost her vitality had stretched the time. There were no signs of movement outside the room—everyone else must have been fast asleep. Stretching my arms overhead, I sank onto the floor. With nothing else to do, I figured I’d catch a quick nap.

I wasn’t sure how much time had passed when the sound of the door opening stirred me awake. The room was cloaked in pitch-black darkness. Turning my head, I saw a sturdy silhouette poke its head in, locking eyes with me. Yu-jeong had short hair, and Han-byeol’s reached her shoulders, so it could only be An-hyeon.

“You must be tired from today. You could’ve slept more,” I said.

I greeted him calmly, but he didn’t respond right away. He just stared at me quietly. After a minute of silence, his lips parted slowly.

“No, I couldn’t sleep. I was too worried. Hyung, how’s Sol doing?”

“She’s much better. She’ll probably be up by tomorrow. No need to worry too much.”

“Really? That’s a relief. Uh, hyung, can I…?”

I could sense An-hyeon’s hesitation, which was unlike him. Still, I waited patiently for him to speak. Something told me this was a moment to let him take his time. Finally, he continued.

“Hyung, there’s something I want to talk about. But not here.”

“Anytime. Want to head to the rooftop?”

“Yeah.”

He didn’t seem to have slept much either. With everything on his mind—An-sol’s condition, the group’s situation—it was no wonder he was restless. Sensing the sincerity in his voice, I got up immediately.

In the living room, Yu-jeong was curled up, clutching her bedding as she slept. Han-byeol was nowhere in sight, likely resting in another room. Careful not to wake them, I quietly unlocked the door and followed An-hyeon to the rooftop.

The cool night air brushed against us, clearing my head. We stood in silence for a moment, gazing at the dark city sprawled before us. An-hyeon was the first to speak.

“Hyung, this city’s so quiet.”

“Too quiet. Suspiciously so. We can’t let our guard down.”

At my words, An-hyeon’s face took on a wistful expression, followed by a bitter smile. I could guess what was weighing on him, but I held back, waiting for him to open up.

“I think you’re really amazing, hyung,” he said.

“Come on, I’m just a person like you. Nothing special.”

“No, that’s not what I mean. It’s not about that.”

He shook his head three times in quick succession, his face clouded with turmoil and a hint of powerlessness. I understood his feelings, but they were still vague, so I stayed quiet, letting him continue.

“After you left today, I thought a lot. When you’re around, I feel like we all fit together perfectly. You might not think so, but I believed the five of us could work together to escape this place.”

“I think so too,” I said.

“Yeah, but I was wrong. You told me to look after the others, but I couldn’t lead them properly. We got taken down by those weird things, and Sol ended up in danger. And you must’ve noticed something off with Yu-jeong and Han-byeol today, right? They fought. Over whether to go save you or stay put.”

An-hyeon’s face twisted with pain as he spoke, but he didn’t stop.

“What really got to me was… I couldn’t make a choice back then. I couldn’t even stop them. All I could manage was to say, ‘I’ll go,’ like I was being pushed into it. It felt so suffocating.”

I stayed silent, letting him pour it out.

“If you hadn’t been there, I’d still be stuck in those thoughts. What about tomorrow? Can I handle it? The pressure was so overwhelming, I even thought about giving up.”

“An-hyeon,” I interjected, trying to rein in his rising emotions, but he shook his head vigorously, signaling he wasn’t done.

“Then you showed up, like a miracle. You know what I felt when I saw you? Not gratitude. Not guilt. Relief. Like, ‘Hyung will handle it. Hyung’s someone I can trust.’ And it’s true. The moment you arrived, things calmed down, and Sol’s condition improved. You’re always so calm, so steady. It’s like you’re unshakable. You’re different from us. I don’t know what it is, but there’s *something* different about you.”

His last words sent a jolt through me, but I kept my expression neutral. As he lowered his head, seemingly spent, I spoke in a quiet voice.

“Can I say something? It won’t be long.”

“Take as long as you want. I’m listening.”

I gave him a small smile and stepped closer, placing a hand on his head. He looked up, startled, as I spoke.

“It’s okay to feel like you want to lean on someone or to feel that pressure. Honestly, I think it’s a good thing.”

“A good thing?” he asked, puzzled.

“Think about it. Back in the forest, how did we work? You didn’t try to do everything alone like some troublemaker, and you didn’t suppress anyone either. I’d give a rough plan, Yu-jeong and Han-byeol would refine it with their insights, and you and I would pick the best option together.”

He listened in silence.

“We’re all supporting you. It’s natural to feel pressure, but you don’t have to carry it all alone. Even if things go wrong, it’s not just on you—it’s on all of us.”

“But…” An-hyeon started, but I raised a hand to stop him. He closed his mouth, understanding my signal.

“You might think I’m impressive, but I think you’re impressive too. Bringing your scared little sister this far, always acting quickly and decisively—it’s not small. Just like An-sol relies on you, you might want to rely on me. And I, Yu-jeong, Han-byeol—we all rely on you and An-sol in some ways too. You said it yourself: the five of us will escape together. But then you contradicted yourself by thinking you have to do it all. Relying on each other isn’t wrong.”

I’d meant to keep it short, but the words had stretched on. Still, I couldn’t stop now, so I pressed on with my final point.

“That burden you’re feeling? We’ll share it. Just do what you *can* do. That’s enough.”

“What I can do…” he echoed softly.

“Exactly. You don’t need to worry about the rest. We’ve got your back, just like you’ve got ours.”

I stood under the night breeze, watching An-hyeon mull over my words. The air felt unusually gentle tonight, almost ticklish. After a moment—about the time it takes to sip a cup of tea—he lifted his head. The uncertainty in his eyes was gone, replaced by the steady, resolute gaze I’d seen when we first met. A hint of relief softened his expression, as if he’d unburdened at least some of his worries.
