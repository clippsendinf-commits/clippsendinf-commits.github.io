# Memorize - Chapter 31 (31/1068): Boss Monster

The weather was clear. The bright sunlight, which we couldn’t see in the forest, gently warmed our heads. It wasn’t a bad feeling, but the only issue was that our group walked in silence, not exchanging a single word.

It had been about six hours since we left the cabin. During that time, we barely spoke, except for the occasional necessary words. The chilly atmosphere between me and Kim Han-byeol played a part, but it wasn’t the only reason if you looked deeper into the group’s mood.

Even so, after walking for so long, you’d expect us to be exhausted, yet we pressed on without a single break, step after step.

How long had we been walking? Finally, a massive warp gate came into view, so large that even seeing just half of it was imposing. The closer we got, the more the group seemed to silently agree to keep their mouths shut. All you could hear were soft, steady breaths. Everyone was likely feeling a surge of excitement, sensing the end was near.

It was good to keep pushing forward, but we couldn’t afford to let our guard down. As expected, we hadn’t encountered a single monster on the path to the warp gate. Perhaps because of that, the group seemed to grow subtly lax, whether they realized it or not.

My mind was uneasy. If a boss monster appeared, there’d be no time to regroup or strategize. It would sense our presence and charge at us like a ghost. If everyone scattered in panic, it’d be a miracle if we avoided casualties. Even with my skills, unless I revealed my true strength, someone was likely to die.

The warp gate was right in front of us. Just a little further, and we’d complete the Rite of Passage successfully. But with such a short distance left, abandoning the strategy and persona I’d maintained so far felt like a waste.

Estimating the remaining distance, it was about 600 meters. Woo Jeong-min had said they were attacked by the boss monster at 300 meters, so half that distance remained before we’d likely face it too. I wanted to slow down and gather my thoughts, but contrary to my wishes, the group’s pace quickened. An-hyeon must have sensed it too, as he broke the long silence, speaking to An-sol in an excited tone.

“Sol, let’s push a bit harder. Once we reach that big oval structure up ahead, we’ll finally get out of this wretched place. Just hold on a little longer.”

“Okay!” 

An-sol nodded vigorously, her face bright with enthusiasm, even flashing a smile. She seemed thrilled. I was about to suggest a brief rest, but I closed my mouth. No matter how much I thought, no clever solution came to mind. I had no choice but to match their pace, and as time passed, the distance to the warp gate shrank further.

Of course, I might be worrying over nothing. The best outcome would be to reach the warp gate without incident. No one hurt, no one injured—a happy ending. But an ominous feeling lingered, a nagging unease in the back of my mind. I was using the widest and most precise mana detection since entering the Rite of Passage, yet there was no sign of the boss monster.

We were now 500 meters from the goal. The warp gate gradually revealed its full grandeur. A sturdy altar supported the massive oval structure, as imposing as a large building. At its center, a donut-like hole housed a pale blue orb floating gently, occasionally emitting thin blue sparks—clearly the mana core powering the gate.

From a distance, the orb looked like a beautiful gem, instantly drawing everyone’s attention. An-sol gazed at it with pure wonder, and even Kim Han-byeol’s calm eyes showed a hint of fascination. Lee Yu-jeong, in particular, was entranced, her dreamy expression fixed on the orb’s radiant glow.

“It’s so beautiful… I want to break it into pieces and make earrings. They’d look stunning if I wore them. I want it.”

“Unni, I just want to keep it as it is and admire it. It’s really gorgeous.”

As Lee Yu-jeong and An-sol chatted softly, An-hyeon seemed lost in thought, likely picturing Yu-jeong with those earrings. After a moment, he shook his head and spoke.

“That’s a horrifying idea.”

“What? What’s that supposed to mean, our dear Hyeon?” 

Yu-jeong’s indignant retort came as she playfully smacked An-hyeon’s side. An-sol’s face lit up with a shy smile, probably pleased at the thought of earrings suiting her. An-hyeon’s deadpan response didn’t seem to upset her. The guy had all the makings of a harem king, yet his sister complex was almost tragic. The thought made me chuckle despite myself.

Only 400 meters remained. Looking around, the area resembled the clearing where we started. Sparse patches of grass sprouted here and there, with most of the ground covered in dirt. Occasionally, I noticed unusually dark clumps of earth. When I stepped on them, they felt hard, unlike the softer dirt nearby. Was this blood-soaked earth, hardened from past battles?

If so, it was likely the remnants of users who fell in previous Rites of Passage, just before reaching the warp gate. I was probably the only one who noticed, but I kept silent and continued walking.

At 300 meters, we were nearly jogging, our faces alight with the joy of survival and accomplishment. Even An-hyeon and Yu-jeong, who had been bickering earlier, exchanged smiles. An-sol was practically beaming, and though Han-byeol remained composed, there was a subtle relief in her expression.

Yet, even at 300 meters, no boss monster appeared. Maybe Woo Jeong-min’s group was just unlucky. With An-sol’s luck stat of 100, it wasn’t impossible we’d escape unscathed. After one final scan with my detection, finding nothing, I started to relax, ready to release my mana. 

But I didn’t know then that we’d popped the champagne too early.

*Parut! Parutsut!*

At 200 meters, a piercing noise, like space itself tearing, hit my ears. The air shifted, and the space around us warped unnaturally—a sign of immense mana in motion. The group, sensing something ominous, stopped in their tracks. I quickly activated my Third Eye.

As expected, a sudden surge of mana ripples spread across the clearing. At first glance, they seemed to scatter randomly, but a closer look revealed they were moving in a specific pattern. Calming my mind, I tried to analyze the mana’s flow, but then—

A resonant roar shook the entire space, and a massive magical array appeared in the middle of the path we’d taken. The moment I saw its pattern, I cursed inwardly. It was a high-level summoning circle. I sent my mana covertly to disrupt its structure, but…

It was too late. The fully formed array glowed brightly, activating.

So that’s how it was. The boss monster was summoned through a magical array. Our group, myself included, stared blankly at the glowing circle in the air. It was visible to everyone, no doubt. But no one spoke, overwhelmed by the sinister, foreboding aura it exuded.

*Wooong! Wooong!*

The summoning began. First to appear were the boss monster’s face and fingers. Its face was grotesque—elongated, eyeless, with a wide, torn mouth revealing sharp teeth. Its fingers, gleaming like massive scythes, shimmered with a deadly edge. A pitch-black armored body, as if clad in dark steel, emerged, along with a long, whip-like tail.

When the summoning was complete, the boss monster stood over five meters tall, a towering behemoth. The boss had arrived.

*Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch. Gulp!*

Blood stained its mouth, as if it had just devoured prey, yet it licked its lips hungrily, eyeing us. 

I glanced at my group. I wanted to praise them for not scattering in terror, but Yu-jeong, Han-byeol, and An-sol were frozen in panic, unable to move, overwhelmed by the monster’s murderous aura. Only An-hyeon managed to speak, his face full of disbelief.

“No… this can’t be… What is this thing…?”

*Kieeeeeeeee!*

Before he could finish, the boss monster’s deafening roar struck us, laced with killing intent. The sonic wave sent shivers through our bodies. The group, as if snapped out of a spell, stumbled back a step or two but could move no further. Time was running out. I spoke in a low but clear voice.

“Everyone, stay focused. Don’t panic. Respond calmly.”

“Hyung… it’s impossible. This time, it’s too much. We can’t win. We have to run!” 

An-hyeon, misinterpreting my actions as I readied my crossbow, stammered in fear. The boss’s overwhelming presence had sapped their will to fight. Yelling or scolding would only cause more chaos. I hadn’t planned to fight it with them anyway. Infusing my voice with soothing mana, I calmed their frozen bodies.

“I’m not saying we fight. Facing that thing head-on is madness. Like you said, we run. But if we scatter aimlessly, it’ll hunt us down one by one. So we run toward the warp gate.”

“Y-Yes, hurry…” 

Yu-jeong nodded, still disoriented. I sighed inwardly. An-hyeon and Han-byeol were slowly shaking off their fear, their eyes flickering with a faint spark of survival instinct. My calm demeanor and the trust they’d placed in me so far seemed to give them hope that I had a plan.

“Drop all your gear and weapons. Lighten your load and sprint for the warp gate.”

“W-What…?”

The boss roared again. Time was up. An-sol was still dazed, looking around aimlessly, and my frustration surged. I approached her, forcibly removing her backpack, and shouted.

“An-hyeon, what are you doing? Drop your sword and shield! You planning to run with those?”

“Y-Yes!” 

An-hyeon, Yu-jeong, and Han-byeol discarded their gear and weapons. The boss monster was now charging toward us on all fours, each step sending a *thud* that felt like a small earthquake.

With the first tremor as my signal, I grabbed An-sol’s hand and ran. The entire group followed, sprinting full speed toward the warp gate.

We ran, and ran, and ran. Despite our desperate sprint, the *thud* sounds behind us grew closer, their intervals shortening. Yu-jeong glanced back nervously, but I shouted immediately.

“Don’t look back! Keep running forward!”

The boss was summoned 300 meters from the warp gate. We were at 200 meters—a 100-meter gap. It would catch us at least once. My goal was to survive that encounter. The monster seemed to gain speed the longer it ran, so if I could stop it even briefly, its momentum would reset.

If it started over at a slower pace, we could reach the warp gate in time. I gripped the crossbow in my left hand tightly.

*Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!*

180 meters left.

*Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!*

160 meters left.

*Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!*

140 meters left. The shortening intervals told me the monster was hitting its stride. Running alone wouldn’t shake it off. The moment had come. While the group was distracted by their sprint, I infused a precise amount of mana into an arrow. A regular arrow wouldn’t pierce its steel-like armor. After completing the mana transfer, my left wrist radiated a sharpness twice as intense as before.

Preparations were done. It was time for me to act. Hesitating could lead to an irreversible disaster. I stopped running and released An-sol’s hand.

Her shocked cry rang out as I halted, and the group seemed to sense something was wrong. Before they could turn, I shouted fiercely.

“Don’t look back! Keep running!”

My angry tone startled them, but I confirmed their heads turned forward again. I spun around, facing the boss monster charging toward me, clearly targeting me first. Swiftly, I raised my left arm, crossbow ready.
