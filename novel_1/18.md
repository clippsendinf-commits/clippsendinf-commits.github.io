# Memorize - Chapter 17 (17/1068)

# Split in Half

“Lure them. We’re going to lure those things.”

“What? You mean draw those monsters toward us?”

It was close, but she missed the point slightly. I shook my head lightly. Most of the group stared at me blankly, but Kim Han-byeol raised an eyebrow, seeming to grasp the gist of what I meant. Still, it looked like some explanation was in order.

“No, not draw them to us. One person acts as bait to lead those monsters away.”

I paused for a moment and pointed toward the depths of the forest. As everyone’s gazes followed my gesture, I continued.

“If you make a commotion, the monsters will definitely come running for the bait. You keep their attention and lead them deeper into the forest. While they’re distracted, the rest of us can climb over that wall. That way, we escape the forest.”

I deliberately emphasized the hopeful note of escaping the forest, but skeptical expressions clouded everyone’s faces. It wasn’t a positive reaction. They clearly weren’t thrilled about the idea. Still, their silence suggested they saw some merit in it. Of course, for this plan to work, there was one unavoidable issue.

It’s obvious without saying it: who would take on the role of bait? Sure, the Deadmen might seem manageable if they just shamble slowly, but once they spot prey, they break into a run. The person acting as bait could easily get surrounded and become their meal if they’re not careful.

For a while, everyone just exchanged uneasy glances, but Kim Han-byeol, quick as ever, pinpointed the core problem.

“So, you’re saying one of us has to sacrifice themselves.”

“Exactly.”

“Who’s going to do it?”

Silence. With the chance to escape the forest right in front of them, no one was eager to volunteer. I couldn’t entirely blame them for hesitating, so I let out a soft sigh and raised my hand. Rather than sending someone else and worrying about them, I figured it’d be easier on my conscience to do it myself.

“The one who suggested it should do it. I’ll handle it.”

“No way! That’s too dangerous!”

“Oppa, Han-byeol’s right. Let’s just hide and wait a bit longer, okay?”

Kim Han-byeol’s immediate objection and Lee Yu-jeong’s pleading were within my expectations, so I shared the reasoning I’d prepared.

“We can’t keep waiting. We don’t know when those things might spot us.”

“There’s also the option of heading in a different direction.”

Kim Han-byeol again. I shook my head and countered.

“That’d take time, and it’s almost evening. If we’re going to escape, this is our last shot.”

“But still…”

Despite Kim Han-byeol’s persistent doubts, I raised my voice slightly, adding weight to my words. I hadn’t forgotten how she’d looked uncomfortable when Lee Yu-jeong spoke casually earlier, so I kept my tone formal with her.

“If there’s no opening, we make one. There’s no guarantee another spot will be any better than here.”

Unable to find a counterargument, Kim Han-byeol fell silent, her expression heavy. A brief pause followed. Inside, she was probably relieved she didn’t have to be the bait, yet felt guilty toward me. That was the difference between her and someone like Park Dong-geol.

Park Dong-geol called it hypocrisy. If I’m being honest, he and I shared some similar views back then. The old me would’ve called them out for being fake, but with this group, I needed to be the reliable “hyung” or “oppa” who quietly supported them from behind. If Park Dong-geol had kept his ego in check or been remotely useful, I might not have let him go so easily. I chuckled to myself at the pointless thought.

The silence was broken by an unexpected voice.

“But… Su-hyeon oppa… that’s too dangerous.”

I turned to see An-sol, her face flushed, mumbling with concern. Was she worried about me? Feeling a bit touched, I wanted to give her a peck on the cheek, but with An-hyeon around—likely to think me a fool—I settled for a gentle smile. Pretending to scan our surroundings vigilantly, I continued.

“We can’t kick away a chance to escape the forest. I always knew we’d have to take risks like this eventually. It’s just happening sooner than expected.”

“Still…”

“It’s silly to say at twenty-three, but I’m the oldest here. If I don’t step up now, when will I?”

My lighthearted tone seemed to brighten An-sol’s expression a little. Then, An-hyeon, who’d been quiet until now, spoke up. He looked like he’d been mulling something over and had come to a decision.

“Hyung.”

“Yeah?”

“When I saw those monsters earlier, they walk normally but start running when they spot someone. There’s a chance you could get caught while luring them.”

“True, but they seemed to move at a fast walk, not a sprint. If I run at full speed, I’m confident I won’t get caught. Think of it like the morning jogs we did during roll call.”

“Even if we manage to escape… what about… what about you, oppa… how will you get out?”

Kim Han-byeol interjected again. Wait, did she just say “oppa”? Did I mishear? Tilting my head, I responded.

“I’ll figure that out when the time comes. For now, I think this is our only option. I’d like everyone, including you, Han-byeol-ssi, to focus on getting out of this forest.”

“Then let me go with you, hyung. You shouldn’t have to take that risk alone.”

No, you’d be better off staying put. As soon as An-hyeon finished, An-sol’s eyes widened, and she grabbed his sleeve tightly. I looked at him, exasperated, and let out a heavy sigh.

“No way. You need to stay with the others.”

“Why? You don’t have to take all the danger on yourself.”

“There might be more of them beyond that wall. We need someone to protect the group just in case. Besides, it’s easier to lure them alone.”

“But still…”

“And you’ve got your sister to look after.”

Mentioning An-sol shut An-hyeon up instantly. Her eyes, looking at me, were filled with a mix of gratitude, worry, and guilt. Normally, I’d find someone like An-sol annoying, but for some reason, she didn’t rub me the wrong way.

After a moment, An-hyeon reluctantly nodded.

“…Alright. I’m counting on you, hyung.”

“You got it. I want to survive too. Trust me.”

“I do.”

“You can. Let’s pull the bull by the horns and act now. Everyone, get low. Once I’ve lured them far enough, An-hyeon, you lead the others and run. Don’t look back, don’t do anything stupid like turning around. Just keep running forward. Got it?”

The girls said nothing, their faces heavy with complex emotions—relief at the chance to survive mixed with guilt for not volunteering. Before stepping out with my loaded crossbow, I heard Kim Han-byeol, Lee Yu-jeong, and An-sol each say something.

“…I’m sorry.”

“Oppa… thank you. Don’t die, please.”

“Be careful…”

Their sincere concern warmed me, and I responded with a strong voice.

“Good luck.”

I moved into action immediately. Of course, I didn’t start making a ruckus right where the group was hiding—that’d be reckless, and in the worst case, it could expose them. Scanning the area quickly, I spotted some rocks at the top of a rise. If I got up there, I’d have a clear view of the surroundings, and the Deadmen would all see me. The trees here weren’t as thick as before, but they were enough to conceal a single person moving carefully.

I crouched low, weaving between trees, muffling my breaths and footsteps. I had to move without being noticed. Staying stealthy wasn’t new to me, so it didn’t feel too challenging. For a moment, my first run through the Rite of Passage flashed in my mind.

Back then, in a clearing, Park Dong-geol and Lee Yu-jeong had argued, and a stone he kicked drew the Deadmen. I’d only thought of saving myself, fleeing alone without direction, wandering the forest for two days. Comparing then to now made me laugh.

I could’ve handled it more calmly. There could’ve been other ways. The thought crossed my mind briefly.

I kept my breathing shallow and my steps silent, slipping between trees with precision. The pile of rocks I aimed for wasn’t particularly high, but their smooth, rounded shapes would make it hard for Deadmen to climb. Plus, I wanted to check if I could spot a village or building beyond the wall, even from a distance.

Moving through about twenty trees, I wasn’t spotted once. Reaching the rock pile, I glanced around, then swiftly climbed up. The open view revealed the situation below clearly. Beyond the wall, I couldn’t see a village or building, but I figured we’d find something closer to the center, so it wasn’t a big concern.

I felt relieved I hadn’t opted for a frontal assault. My mana detection had been spot-on. Seeing Deadmen scattered all around, I carefully stepped to the top of the rock pile. Glancing at where the group was hiding, I saw An-hyeon peeking out, timing his move. Now, I had to be the perfect bait for everyone’s sake. After a quick nod to An-hyeon, I took a deep breath.

And I shouted with all my might.

“AHHHHHHHHHH!”

My voice echoed through the air. The effect was immediate—absolutely perfect. Every Deadman in sight turned toward me. They roared and charged in my direction. It was a success, but it still felt a bit lacking.

Waving my arms wildly and shouting to provoke them, more Deadmen emerged from the forest. To draw in even those on the far right, I needed to hold my ground on the rock pile a bit longer. I opened my mouth again, shouting louder.

“WAAAAAHHHH! Monsters! I’m right here! Look at me!”

*Growl. Growl. Growl. Growl. Growl. Growl. Growl. Growl.*

As soon as I finished, a chorus of howls hit my ears. I felt the monsters surging toward me in a massive wave. The closest Deadman had already reached the rock pile, frantically trying to climb. I didn’t need to shout anymore. Starving for prey, every Deadman in the area was charging toward me, roaring. I muttered calmly to myself.

*Brings back memories.*

Watching the gathering monsters, I let a faint smile spread across my face. Raising the crossbow on my left arm, I pulled out three bolts. This crossbow could hold one bolt in the string and two more loaded, letting me fire three shots per reload. Before aiming at the forehead of the Deadman scrambling below, I glanced back at where the group was hiding.

For some reason, I couldn’t stop smiling.
