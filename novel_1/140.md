# Chapter 139: The End of Training

The morning dawned. It was finally the day to set out on a new expedition. The ruins we were to explore this time were the *Screaming Cave*. As this expedition would take at least three weeks, we needed to prepare the caravan thoroughly. As I opened the door of the *Modest Lady* inn, a cool breeze and fresh air greeted me. I closed my eyes for a moment, breathing in the crisp air deeply. It felt as though my entire body was being refreshed.

“Wow, the weather’s really nice. Perfect day for a trip,” came a voice.

Turning around, I saw Ha-yeon stepping out, adjusting her flowing hair. She had a small backpack slung over her shoulder—a new travel bag we’d purchased for this expedition. Given the duration, we’d bought four high-quality backpacks and entrusted them to the mages and priests. (Melee fighters didn’t get backpacks, as they could be cumbersome in combat.)

I responded to her bright smile with a gentle one of my own. “In a way, this is kind of like a trip, isn’t it? The *Hall Plane* has plenty of scenic spots.”

“Hoho. I’d rather pass on a trip where my life’s at stake,” she replied playfully.

Around her neck hung a necklace glowing with a beautiful hue. It was undoubtedly the *Necklace of Glory* we’d obtained from the *Ruined Laboratory*. I was curious about what magic she’d memorized with it, but as the rest of the party emerged one by one, I held my tongue.

The kids were also decked out in gear from the *Ruined Laboratory*, looking well-prepared. An-hyeon and Yu-jeong, in particular, were a far cry from the novices they’d been when they first arrived in *Mul*. Back then, they could barely be called Users, but now they at least looked the part of rookie Users. Though it was only surface-level for now, I felt a surge of pride knowing I’d trained them.

“Ugh, these gloves are amazing! My spear feels as light as a twig,” An-hyeon said, swinging his spear with ease and a satisfied grin. The *Gloves of Reduction* didn’t boost physical strength directly, but their utility was undeniable. Watching him twirl his spear with a happy expression, I slowly scanned the rest of the party.

Once Vivian, Sang-yong, and Yeon-ju finished their preparations and came down, I lined everyone up. Yeon-ju casually shut the inn’s door and stood at the center of the group. Taking the lead, I began walking toward the north gate.

Along the way, we spotted a few groups of Users. At this point in time, anyone still in *Mul* likely had subpar stats or was very new. They gazed at us with envious eyes, probably struggling to survive day by day. I could relate—back in my first cycle as a rookie User, I’d felt the same envy watching well-equipped Users head out for expeditions early in the morning.

We passed through the north gate with the guards’ enthusiastic salutes, and the party’s atmosphere shifted instantly. The lively chatter died down, and the excited expressions on the kids’ faces turned serious as they began scanning their surroundings. They knew my temperament well—inside the city, they could mess around, but in the field, I tolerated no nonsense. The training I’d put them through was paying off. Yeon-ju, noticing the change in mood, tilted her head with an approving look, which made me feel even more satisfied.

Our party currently consisted of eight members. It wasn’t a perfect lineup (if you ignored individual stats), and we lacked some classes. Still, compared to when we tackled *Vivian’s Ancient Alchemist Dungeon*, we had a decent composition.

That said, it was time to refine each User’s role. I took the lead as the tank and overall coordinator. An-hyeon was assigned as a sub-tank to support me and handle secondary combat. An-sol stood in the center of the formation, with Vivian, Ha-yeon, and Sang-yong forming a triangular guard around her. It might seem like the center was vulnerable, but Yeon-ju’s role as a keeper offset any weaknesses entirely.

One unusual detail was Yu-jeong’s request to take the rear while also acting as a free-roamer. In the past, I’d have shut that down immediately, but I agreed on the condition that she’d operate freely only with my permission.

Thus, we reached the plains where we’d previously explored *Vivian’s Ancient Alchemist Dungeon* and the *Ruined Laboratory*. Without delay, I turned east and led the party onward.

The kids followed my orders diligently, but their eyes betrayed an unshakable confidence. The thrill of going on an expedition after so long, the high-quality gear, their improved skills, and the envious glances from other Users—all these factors made their enthusiasm double what it normally was.

However, I intended to douse that enthusiasm. While riding this momentum was fine, I believed it was more important to instill a sense of caution. Compared to their peers, the kids had grown tremendously strong, but in the grand scheme of the *Hall Plane*, they were still greenhorns. From what I’d observed, their current confidence could easily turn into pride, and worse, arrogance. Instead of scolding them, I decided the best way to make them realize this was to create a situation where they’d come to the understanding themselves.

The party kept conversation to a minimum, save for necessary exchanges. After maintaining a steady marching pace for a while, I turned to look back. *Mul* was no longer visible in the distance. The sun was rising higher, signaling that noon was approaching. I unfolded the map to gauge our position and decided to slightly adjust our course.

Despite our brisk pace, we hadn’t encountered any monsters or vagrants. Vagrants aside, it was surprising that not a single monster had attacked us. As we continued marching with the adjusted course, I noticed the kids, who had been hyper-vigilant at the start, beginning to relax. It was time to put my plan into action. I quickened my pace.

Soon, the mountain I’d targeted came into view, rising before us. I paused and addressed the party. “From now on, we’ll be crossing the mountain ahead.”

“Huh? Do we really need to climb it? You said the journey would take ten days, but as far as I know, the direct route leads to the same destination. Why waste energy scaling a mountain?” Yeon-ju’s point was valid—she was suggesting we conserve energy for the long march ahead. But I had my reasons and responded smoothly.

“I did some preliminary research on other ruins besides the *Screaming Cave*. Originally, I planned to take the direct route, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to pass by a few sites along the way. We won’t explore them in detail, but it’s better than skipping them entirely. The path might be a bit winding, but I’ll ensure we arrive on schedule. That said, we’ll need to pick up the pace, so I’m counting on everyone to keep up.”

“So, you’re saying you’ve already investigated all the ruins along the same route as the *Screaming Cave*?” Yeon-ju asked.

“Yes. I selected only those in our direction to prepare for any contingencies,” I replied humbly before turning to move on. Yeon-ju gave me a puzzled look, clearly not fully convinced, but I was the caravan leader. Besides, she’d been the one to point out the need for a backup plan if we couldn’t find the *Screaming Cave*, so she had little room to argue.

I felt a bit sorry for Ha-yeon, Sang-yong, and Vivian, but this was a necessary step. The *Screaming Cave* was essentially a final training exercise in *Mul*. The kids probably thought it was manageable since it was a small city with fewer Users around. But the moment they stepped into a regular or major city, the situation would change drastically—Users everywhere, vagrants ready to stab you in the back if you let your guard down, and dungeons and monsters far more challenging. To survive in that environment, they needed to understand their current standing.

Thus, I chose marching as my method. I would use the most basic requirement of a User in the *Hall Plane*—marching—to temper their spirits.

We were now standing before the mountain we’d aimed for. From a distance, it might not have seemed imposing, but up close, the massive mountain range loomed large, and the party’s demeanor shifted noticeably. Before entering the mountain, I reiterated my instructions firmly.

“We’re about to cross the mountain ahead. It hasn’t been named yet, but according to the library records I checked, it’s part of a range spanning three peaks. Climbing will be tough, but we won’t extend our arrival schedule. Keep up with my pace and stay vigilant. Mountains have a high monster encounter rate.”

I heard someone swallow hard. The small, almost cute sound made me chuckle briefly before I sent An-hyeon and Yu-jeong to the rear to support the mages and priests in case they faltered. An-hyeon, still brimming with confidence, followed my orders, likely recalling the forced march through the *Black Forest*. But that march had been tailored to their level. This time, I intended to show them how real Users conducted expeditions.

“Let’s move out,” I said.

The party nodded in unison, and I strode into the mountain.

“Haa, haa.”

“Huff, huff.”

The kids, who had started climbing with gusto, were gasping for breath within an hour. An-sol, predictably, was the first to show signs of exhaustion. As a priest with naturally low stamina, she was the weakest link. I didn’t slow down in the slightest.

The others gritted their teeth and kept up, even the mages. For An-hyeon and Yu-jeong to complain about fatigue would be laughable, especially since they weren’t even carrying backpacks. But as An-sol began to lag, An-hyeon and Yu-jeong had to drag her along, increasing their own stamina drain.

I could feel their pleading looks, begging for a break, but I pressed on without hesitation, climbing steep slopes with ease. The party must have felt like they were dying. Whenever the formation faltered even slightly, I called out the offending User.

“Focus! Don’t fall behind and keep the formation tight. We’re not even in combat—just marching. If you can’t handle this, what are we supposed to do?”

The training hadn’t been for nothing, though. Despite their labored breathing, they kept pushing forward. Satisfied with their effort, I increased the pace further. I was determined to make them feel that their time in *Mul* was a paradise compared to this.

After another hour of marching, I spotted a small clearing and finally stopped. Glancing back, I saw the party drenched in sweat. I activated my detection to scan the surroundings before speaking calmly.

“We’ll take a ten-minute break here. I’ll keep watch, so feel free to sit and rest.”

At my words, the kids collapsed on the spot. Yeon-ju stretched as if she’d just finished a good workout, while Vivian and Ha-yeon shared water. Sang-yong took out his canteen and offered sips to the kids.

“Isn’t this pace a bit too fast?” Yeon-ju asked, approaching me with a cheerful expression as she took in the scenery.

“A stamina stat of 50—no, even 45—should be enough to keep up. After all the training we’ve done, it’d be problematic if they couldn’t handle this,” I replied.

“Hoho. They managed to keep up, didn’t they? The mages barely made it, and the two melee fighters burned double the stamina dragging one person along.”

I glanced over to see An-hyeon blowing into Sang-yong’s canteen like a trumpet. His stamina was decent, but dragging An-sol along had taken a toll. Yu-jeong was in the same boat, her lips pressed tightly together, eyes trembling, but she held back tears admirably.

“If they’re struggling with a simple march, that’s a problem. The mages kept up fine, didn’t they? It just shows their mental state is still lacking,” I said.

“My, you’re a lot stricter out here than in the city,” Yeon-ju teased, covering her mouth with a playful smile.

I shook my head slightly, watching the kids for a moment before turning away.
