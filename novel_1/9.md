# Chapter 8: Kim Su-hyeon Begins the Rite of Passage

The Preparation Room. It had been a long time since I’d seen this place. To someone unaware of its purpose, it might seem like a cozy personal room, almost indistinguishable from one on Earth. 

It struck me suddenly that the angels put effort into the strangest details. When I first arrived here, the familiar environment had fooled me into trying to open the front door, only to find it locked, plunging me into despair. I couldn’t shake the thought that maybe the angels designed it that way on purpose.

『Time remaining until the Rite of Passage: 03 minutes 27 seconds』

“Three minutes and twenty-seven seconds. Better hurry.”

I approached the large box placed in the center of the room. Sitting casually by its side, I opened it to find various items needed for the Rite of Passage. Forget nostalgia—there was none of that here. My immediate concern was getting dressed quickly. Even if Seraph didn’t care, being teleported into the Rite of Passage nearly naked would brand me a pervert from the start.

Examining the contents, I could tell at a glance that the tight-fitting bodysuit had the best performance. But I couldn’t muster the courage to wear it. After rummaging through the options, I settled on simple clothing: underwear, socks, shoes, a top, and pants—all plain, nothing fancy. I chose darker colors to avoid visible dirt.

Honestly, with my current abilities, I could charge through the Rite of Passage barehanded and clear it in less than a day. If I wanted, I could obliterate everything in my path without breaking a sweat. But I had no intention of going all out from the start. One of the biggest reasons I survived ten years in the Hall Plane was because I always kept thirty percent of my strength hidden. Except in life-or-death situations, I made a point of never revealing my full capabilities.

“Now, what weapon should I choose…”

Picking a weapon required some thought. Even barehanded, I could take down the Rite of Passage’s boss monster while eating breakfast, but for convenience, I figured I’d take something. I had a plan for this Rite, though. Just in case, I selected a long sword, a detachable crossbow, and a full quiver of crossbow bolts before closing the box.

Holding the bundle of bolts, I glanced up to see the remaining time converge exactly to zero.

『The Preparation Room time has ended. User Kim Su-hyeon will now be summoned to the Rite of Passage.』

“Alright. Am I the last one?”

『Yes. Regardless, we wish User Kim Su-hyeon the best of luck. Transmission will now commence.』

And then it happened.

*Whoong!*

The moment I felt the summoning spell unfold in the air, a sharp tug pulled at my navel. The summoning had begun.

*

『Transmission complete. The Rite of Passage is a test to determine your eligibility to enter the Hall Plane. Survive for seven days or reach the central warp gate within that time to pass. We wish all users the best of luck.』

The transmission was over. Breathing in the crisp air, I scanned my surroundings. The atmosphere felt subtly different, charged with an odd energy. The grass, trees, and dirt suggested I was in a forest clearing. The air was fresh, the breeze cool, but an unsettling stickiness seemed to cling to everything.

“Time to check who I’m starting with.”

The Rite of Passage was something I took very seriously. The Hall Plane was not a place where anyone could survive alone. Even if just for utility, companions were necessary.

The Rite of Passage was the first taste of the extraordinary for ordinary people accustomed to everyday life. Survival was the key condition here. For clueless modern humans, cooperating to meet that condition was a core aspect of the Rite. (My second run is a special case, so let’s set that aside for now.) Those who survived together often formed strong bonds that carried over into the Hall Plane. This time, I intended to scout for companions I could build lasting connections with.

“Of course, I can’t just take anyone.”

The place I’d been summoned to was the starting point of the Rite of Passage, the so-called Starting Point. Ten years later, I could talk about it casually, but my first time here, completely clueless, was a nightmare. It was so bad that I carried trauma from it even after entering the Hall Plane.

I steadied my mind and began observing my surroundings. As expected, I wasn’t alone. Scattered around the clearing were people with anxious expressions, some whispering about me.

“Oppa… did you see that guy just get teleported in?”

“Sol, keep it down.”

“What do we do… I thought it was just us…”

“Hold on. He looks like he’s in the same boat as us.”

From their conversation, they seemed to be siblings. I walked toward the group. The clearing was quiet, almost heavy. Understandably so—being thrown into the Rite of Passage with instructions to survive would rattle anyone. But these people had likely received some explanation from the angels, just as I had.

“This is the Starting Point. Since I’ve gone back in time, I must’ve met these same users in my first run… What happened to them afterward?”

Counting the people in the clearing, there were eight in total. Could these eight band together to survive the next seven days? I could confidently say, “No.”

A conflict stirred within me. This wasn’t the Hall Plane yet—just a one-time space I’d never return to after passing. With my current power, saving everyone here would be trivial. But honestly, I didn’t want to, nor did I plan to.

Showing off my abilities and saving everyone was the last thing I should do. Reputation spreads fastest through word of mouth. The established powers in the Hall Plane were obsessed with maintaining their dominance. If rumors spread about a user who used magic or overwhelmed monsters with extraordinary skill before even passing the Rite, it would invite trouble. At best, I’d deal with annoyances; at worst, I could be targeted for a mysterious assassination by “vagrants.”

I wasn’t a saint. I’d done good deeds in the Hall Plane, but I’d also committed bad ones without hesitation when necessary—robbery, plunder, rape, even murder. In the world of the Hall Plane, such acts were often accepted as normal, so no one could really judge me.

The key here was selection. If I found someone worth making a companion, I’d have to play the role of a subtle guardian for at least a year until they could stand on their own.

My first plan upon entering the Hall Plane was to gather companions, and the Rite of Passage was the perfect place for it. I had three criteria for choosing them: first, their stats and potential; second, their disposition; third, their connection to me. To put it bluntly, if someone met my standards, I’d keep them alive. If not, I didn’t care whether they lived or died.

“Time to use the Third Eye.”

Except for the siblings huddled together, everyone was keeping their distance from each other. I found a suitable spot to sit and began observing them calmly. If I was lucky, I might even spot a familiar face.

The first user to catch my eye was a woman dressed like a bank teller. She looked ordinary overall, but her wide, trembling eyes and quivering lips suggested she hadn’t yet accepted reality. I could sympathize, but I activated the Third Eye to check her stats, focusing only on what mattered.

“Huh.”

I let out a dry laugh and immediately closed her status window. Initial stats are influenced by physical condition but are primarily a reflection of a user’s potential. Being female doesn’t automatically mean lower physical stats than a male.

But Lee Bo-rim’s potential was abysmally low. Even if she survived and entered the Hall Plane, she’d be useless by my standards.

As an aside, early training in the Hall Plane can significantly boost stats. My body has already reached its limit, so training won’t help me much, but new users face no such restrictions. Even so, users destined for greatness show early promise. This woman, though, showed none.

Clicking my tongue, I shifted my gaze to the next target—the siblings sitting close together. The male had a youthful air but a furrowed brow, giving him a sharp, edgy vibe. He looked younger than me, with a cocky attitude that suggested confidence. On the ground beside them were a long sword and a shield—a decent choice.

The female clung to his side, head bowed, making it hard to see her face clearly. Still, she seemed far meeker than her brother.

“What the—? Magic 75 and Luck 100 from the start?”

Unbelievable stats. I nearly let out a gasp but clamped my lips shut just in time.

Strictly speaking, An-hyeon was a talent. With stats like that, he could breeze through the Rite of Passage unless something extraordinary happened. He had the potential to survive in the Hall Plane as well. It stung a bit, but his starting stats were arguably better than mine.

What truly shocked me, though, was An-sol’s stats. They were beyond comprehension. Her physical stats—Strength, Endurance, Agility, Stamina—were nothing special. But a starting Magic stat of 75 and Luck at 100? That defied the Hall Plane’s norms. I racked my brain.

“I don’t recall hearing about An-hyeon… but An-sol… wait, Sol?”

The name “Sol” sparked a memory. When choosing class perks in my first run, I’d seen a Secret Class called Priest of Radiance. It was considered the pinnacle of priest classes, and a user named “Sol” had obtained it, later being recruited by the Odin Clan, the gathering place of top users.

An-sol and Sol. The names matched, and her stats suggested immense potential. Since they were siblings, I’d likely need to keep both alive. Compared to Lee Bo-rim, the bank teller, these two were on another level—worthy candidates for companions.

Their impact was so strong that I decided to continue counterclockwise. The next two caught by my Third Eye were men.

The man on the left was older, with a decent build but short stature. His slightly crooked nose and rough skin gave him a sly appearance. His eyes darted around, as if trying to assess the situation.

The man on the right was a student in a school uniform. His small tear-shaped mole under his eye and pale skin made him look very young. He seemed meek, trembling and clutching his knees with both arms, almost pitiful.

“No memory of them… Let’s check their info.”

(Remaining stat points: 0)

An-hyeon and An-sol’s stats were so shocking that Park Dong-geol and Lee Shin-u’s didn’t seem bad by comparison (though they weren’t exactly great either).

Park Dong-geol’s base stats were enough to survive the Rite of Passage, but his disposition was troubling. Devil and Chaos together were rare and suggested he might have been a criminal on Earth, likely to become a “vagrant” in the Hall Plane.

In contrast, Lee Shin-u’s stats were slightly below what was needed to pass the Rite, but his Magic was decent, and his Luck showed high potential for a beginner. Lawful and Good together were also rare, indicating an inherently kind nature.

Aside from me and Park Dong-geol, everyone was too preoccupied with themselves or the person next to them. Park Dong-geol’s eyes gleamed with an unsettling desire, darting mostly toward the women. I’d seen that look thousands of times—I’d even had it myself once. I could guess what fueled it. If he was a criminal, I had a hunch about the kind of crimes he’d committed.

Seeing him leer at An-sol, licking his lips, confirmed my suspicions. I didn’t have much ground to judge him now, but he still seemed pathetic.

Clicking my tongue, I was about to activate the Third Eye on the remaining two women when—

“Ugh, damn it.”

Park Dong-geol’s coarse voice echoed loudly across the clearing.
