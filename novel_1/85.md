# Chapter 84: Sweeping Thousands of Miles in One Go

The party stood speechless, faces awestruck, as they gazed at the majestic ruins of the laboratory looming before them. Shin Sang-yong and Jeong Ha-yeon, in particular, could only gape, mouths slightly open. Even for them, accepting the situation at face value seemed a bit too much.

“Th-this… this is unbelievable. Even if it’s beginner’s luck, this is just…” Shin Sang-yong stammered.

“Ha… it’s a little… surprising,” Jeong Ha-yeon added.

Regaining her composure, Jeong Ha-yeon turned her gaze to An-sol, who stood there with a blank expression. I gave a faint smile, approached Sol, and placed my hands on her hips.

“Our Sol is such a lucky charm,” I said.

Even as my hands touched her, Sol showed no resistance. She merely tilted her head, her innocent eyes meeting mine.

“Am I a lucky charm?” she asked.

“Absolutely. You’re the best, Sol.”

Realizing I was praising her, Sol’s face bloomed into a radiant smile. I lifted her up, swinging her gently up and down as if she were riding an airplane.

“Waa! Waa!” Sol squealed, raising both hands in delight and letting out soft, excited cheers. I set her down after a moment and turned back to the group. It had been three days since we left Mul, and now we had discovered the Ruined Laboratory.

---

After a simple breakfast, we left the inn. Everything went smoothly, aside from the odd looks everyone gave Go Yeon-ju as she saw us off at the door. The group’s mood was stable, and with the addition of two skilled mages, our combat strength had grown significantly.

“But, Unni, I’m a bit worried,” Lee Yu-jeong said.

“About what?” Jeong Ha-yeon replied.

Yu-jeong had grown quite attached to Jeong Ha-yeon, even dropping formalities to call her “Unni” and treating her like an older sister. It was reassuring to see Yu-jeong, who used to be so wild, finally have someone to rein her in.

Yu-jeong glanced at me briefly before continuing. “Su-hyeon Oppa and the rest of us have been fighting monsters together outside, so we’ve built some teamwork. But you and User Shin Sang-yong…”

Her words made my face flush with embarrassment. The sound of Jeong Ha-yeon chuckling behind me only made it worse. I wanted to turn around and pinch her cheeks, but I figured it was better to pretend I hadn’t heard. 

We passed through the North Gate and headed straight north. Going northwest would lead to the Black Forest, but north was just an open plain. Beyond that plain lay an endless wasteland, and that was our destination this time.

I had a plan in mind, so I called out in a quiet tone, “Vivian.”

Vivian was in the middle of fielding a barrage of questions from Shin Sang-yong. She had been answering with a haughty air, but when I called her, her face soured slightly. Lately, she’d been showing a bit of defiance, as if she were enjoying herself too much. When I raised my hand slightly, she immediately flashed a bright smile and sidled up to me.

“Yes, Su-hyeon? You called? Heehee.”

“Sorry for interrupting your conversation,” I said with a smirk.

“No, no, it’s fine… Haha, why so formal?” she replied, sweating nervously.

I gave her a cool smile before getting to the point. Vivian was 24 years old, the same age as me, but she carried memories of living over a hundred years as a spider. Though I had done some basic research on her, I still had a lingering curiosity.

“Back when you were human, before you became a spider… was there ever a laboratory near Mul’s northern region?” I asked.

“A laboratory? Yeah, there was,” she answered brightly.

Her response caused the group to slow their steps, as if everyone had overheard. A hint of excitement crept into my voice as I pressed further. “Do you know where it is?”

“Of course, I don’t know the exact location. I don’t remember everything from back then. But if you keep going in this direction, it should show up. Didn’t you already know that?”

Her answer turned my anticipation into disappointment, and my shoulders slumped. Still, at least I’d confirmed that the place I had in mind wasn’t wrong, so it wasn’t a total loss.

The Ruined Laboratory was a place discovered during a time when I wasn’t in Mul, so I didn’t have any strong memories of it. I had only briefly taken interest when I read a report about another caravan successfully exploring it. Vivian, looking a bit sheepish, returned to her original position in the formation.

If I used my Third Eye, I was confident I could find it. But the issue I was grappling with was justification. It would look suspicious if a user in their zeroth year, like me, kept discovering dungeons that even seasoned explorers couldn’t find. It was as obvious as daylight.

Until we were fully settled as a clan, the others hadn’t completely integrated into our group. The kids and Shin Sang-yong might think positively and go along with it, but things wouldn’t always go so smoothly. In my view, Jeong Ha-yeon was almost certainly harboring doubts.

From her perspective, she’d hesitate to join a clan that felt off. From my perspective, I had no desire to recruit a user who was suspicious of us. I’d already instructed the kids to keep quiet about the book and other sensitive matters, but the future was still a concern.

Seeing me lost in thought, Sol’s comforting voice broke through. “Oppa, it’s okay.”

I wanted to snap, “What’s okay?” but knowing she’d probably tear up, I just gave her a faint smile and turned away.

After walking for a full day, by the second day, we had left the plains behind. The farther we got from Mul, the fewer lush green fields we saw, replaced by barren, ochre-colored earth.

As we entered the wasteland, the group’s cheerful chatter faded, replaced by a quiet tension. Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong said little, and the kids, recalling our past expeditions, scanned their surroundings warily.

As if meeting our expectations, a battle with monsters soon erupted.

We were taking a break, sitting quietly, sipping water, and chewing on jerky, when my senses picked up a group of monsters approaching. What was unusual was that they were closing the distance underground.

“It looks like monsters are coming. Everyone, prepare for combat,” I announced.

The kids looked puzzled at my words. At that moment, the ground around us began to bulge upward. The monsters were arriving faster than expected, and I stood with a frown.

“What’s that? An earthquake?” someone asked.

“As if,” I muttered. Though there was panic in their voices, the kids didn’t stand idle. An-hyeon had already drawn his spear, and Yu-jeong was moving into formation. Seeing Sol already raising her staff, I spoke calmly.

“An earthquake? Hardly. They’re Landmoles.”

“Landmoles?” someone echoed.

“Ground moles,” I clarified, drawing my sword. Despite their nature, these moles had a predatory instinct and were circling us underground. I could see the bulging earth multiplying, signaling that we were surrounded. A quick glance showed over ten holes, but my senses detected even more coming from below.

Soon, the ground split open, and a rough, sturdy hand emerged. As expected, a Landmole clambered onto the surface, revealing its round, ochre-colored body with human-like arms and legs. I quickly began planning a defensive formation.

That’s when it happened.

“───. Stream of Aqua!” Jeong Ha-yeon chanted rapidly, her words barely intelligible. In just three syllables, she completed her spell and thrust her staff forward. Water surged from her staff, splitting into fragments that shot toward the ten holes around us with lightning speed.

Her casting speed, response to the monsters, and application of magic were all flawless.

Landmoles lived underground but, as monsters, primarily fed on human flesh. They weren’t the plump, harmless moles people imagined. With rock-hard bodies, near-human height, and sharp claws, they were formidable foes.

Their tough hides resisted ordinary weapons. The usual methods were to infuse weapons with mana for piercing or to overwhelm them with sheer force. But there was an easier way to deal with Landmoles: dousing them with water. Jeong Ha-yeon had recognized the enemy and responded perfectly.

The Landmoles, emerging fiercely from the ground, were drenched, looking like soaked rats. Their reddish-brown bodies hesitated, their initial momentum faltering.

Seizing the moment, Shin Sang-yong stepped forward. “Miss An-sol, I’ll prepare a spell now. Please ready a protection spell just in case. And when I cast my spell, please cast the protection spell on the Landmoles.”

“On the Landmoles?” An-sol stammered, confused.

But seeing Jeong Ha-yeon cut her mana flow and begin a new chant, An-sol hurriedly started her own spell.

“────,” Shin Sang-yong began casting immediately. The Landmoles, realizing another mage was chanting, roared and charged, aware of their vulnerability when wet. But our caravan had another mage—one so fearsome that even hundreds of Landmoles couldn’t scratch her: the Chimera Alchemist.

“Come forth, Aranya! The web of death that rules the 32nd Legion!” Vivian called out, a metaphysical magic circle already glowing beneath her. As it flashed, a familiar spider emerged—not an ordinary one, but Aranya, Vivian’s enhanced chimeric beast.

“Aranya!” Vivian shouted.

As if reading her mind, Aranya opened its massive jaws. “Siiiiii!” Silver threads shot out, weaving through the air like living snakes. The threads deftly avoided our party and swiftly ensnared every charging Landmole.

“Kurik? Kurik?” The Landmoles tried to dodge or cut the threads with their claws, but the sticky, viscous webs tightened around them, leaving them writhing and letting out pitiful cries.

Having finished his casting, Shin Sang-yong aimed with his left hand and shouted, “Miss An-sol, now! I’ll be careful, but please cast at the right moment!”

“Uh? Okay, okay!” An-sol replied.

“Chain Lightning!” Shin Sang-yong’s incantation unleashed a zigzag bolt of electricity that struck the lead Landmole, creating a spectacular scene.

“Kurarararara!”

“Kuririririri!”

“Kweeeeee!”

The combined effect of water and lightning was devastating. But Shin Sang-yong wasn’t done. Still holding his left hand steady, he extended his right. *Double casting?*

“Hold!” he shouted, targeting not the Landmoles but the lightning itself. He forcibly stopped the bolts from spreading further after hitting all the Landmoles. That was An-sol’s cue.

“Miss An-sol, now!” Shin Sang-yong urged.

“R-really…?” An-sol hesitated.

“Hurry!” he pressed.

Biting her lip, An-sol began her chant. “Protect!”

A round barrier formed around some, but not all, of the Landmoles. Then Jeong Ha-yeon’s clear voice rang out. “Reverse!”

The moment her voice echoed, Shin Sang-yong severed the mana link sustaining his spell. *Was this their plan all along?* I stared at them in awe.

The Landmoles trapped in the reversed protection barriers were being torn apart. Bound by the webs, they were struck by lightning that, blocked by the barriers, ricocheted back to pummel their own bodies. The barriers cracked with each hit, but the coordination was impressive. An-sol, unaware her protection spell would be used this way, blinked in astonishment.

Protection spells block external attacks but allow attacks from within. By reversing this property, the lightning was trapped inside, devastating the Landmoles. Reverse was an advanced spell, and seeing it cast so effortlessly was remarkable.

The Landmoles’ state was pitiful. Those inside the barriers were reduced to tattered rags, collapsed on the ground. The rest weren’t much better—over half lay twitching, while the remainder could barely stand, clearly on the verge of death. It was time for the melee fighters to step in.

“An-hyeon. Yu-jeong,” I called softly.

The two, who had been watching in a daze, snapped to attention.

“They’re practically disarmed. Go wild. I’ll stay back as the keeper,” I said.

They exchanged a glance, their competitive spirits ignited, and charged forward. I let out a wry chuckle, still holding my sword, and turned to Jeong Ha-yeon.

She met my gaze with a bright smile, as if saying, “This is my level. Pretty good, right?” I smiled back.

And then, I raised my sword and charged at her.
