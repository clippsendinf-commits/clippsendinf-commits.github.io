# Chapter 114: A Dark Past

In the Hall Plane, a woman’s body could serve as a means of survival—or even a weapon for assassination through intimacy. As such, the concept of chastity wasn’t rigid. In a place where murder and death were commonplace, attitudes toward sex were, if anything, relatively open.  

Of course, this openness didn’t mean chaos. Crimes or acts of force were still problematic. The Northern Continent, where discipline remained strict, wasn’t comparable to the Western Continent, where murder, theft, and rape ran rampant. But if two people’s feelings aligned, having a sexual relationship was far from rare in the Hall Plane. Even Year 0 Users, still clinging to modern sensibilities, grew accustomed to this culture as time passed.  

Jeong Ha-yeon had been betrayed and abandoned—or perhaps “abandoned” wasn’t quite right. The man she’d trusted had never intended to take responsibility for her. She carried the pain of that moment deep in her heart. For over a year, she’d lived with that trauma, shaping her actions.  

It wasn’t just men she distrusted; she struggled to believe in anyone’s inner self. In the Hall Plane, carrying such trauma while navigating its dangers caused immense stress. Though it was unclear what specific trials she’d faced, it was easy to imagine they were filled with anxiety and suffering.  

That accumulated pain was slowly pushing her to her breaking point. She might have endured it while her younger sister was by her side, but after losing her, the overwhelming sense of loss unleashed the trauma she’d suppressed for so long.  

She was acutely aware of her situation. She knew she was in danger, that her heart was crumbling.  

But then, she met me—a User whose early actions mirrored those of her first love, yet whose path diverged from his. I did the things she’d once wished for from that man, the things she’d longed to see. After hearing how others spoke of me and observing my actions, she began to rediscover feelings she thought she’d buried. It was likely after the *Crystal of Truth* that she made her decision.  

Through me, she wanted to shed her trauma. She needed someone to lean on. In a way, I bore some responsibility for her state—after all, I was the one who killed her sister.  

But I felt no guilt. If she could hold onto this resolve, I convinced myself that treating her well moving forward would be enough. I let out a hollow laugh at the thought. I wasn’t exactly normal either. Ten years in the Hall Plane had broken my emotions. Then again, maintaining any semblance of normalcy in this hellish place for over a decade would be the stranger feat.  

Without a word, I led Jeong Ha-yeon to the bed and gently placed her on it, holding her close. She surrendered to my touch, gazing up at me. Drawn by her eyes, I lay beside her on the bed.  

Having confirmed her sincerity, I knew I needed to accept her. I wasn’t noble enough to reject a woman who willingly offered herself to me. Whatever consequences this choice might bring, embracing her now felt like the better path.  

To lighten the mood, I spoke softly.  
“It feels strange, lying in the same bed like this.”  

“You’ll have to get used to stranger things than this,” she replied.  

Her sharp retort caught me off guard. Jeong Ha-yeon was still herself, no doubt. Realizing I’d lost that exchange, I scratched my head and leaned into her chest.  

Her cool hands gently cradled my head. I pressed my face closer, the distinct sensation of her body evident even through her robe. My eyes widened. The only thing I felt was a thin layer of fabric—no undergarments beyond that. Just a thick robe and a single piece of underwear beneath.  

Resting in her embrace for a moment, I lifted my head and spoke.  
“If you want to stop at any point, just let me know. I’ll stop immediately.”  

“That won’t happen. Even if I give any signal, just keep going.”  

Her bold words made me chuckle. I climbed back up to meet her eyes. She spoke again.  
“I have a request.”  

“Tell me.”  

“When you call me, leave out my surname. Just use my first name.”  

I nodded.  
“Alright, Ha-yeon.”  

“No honorifics either. Just my name.”  

“…Ha-yeon.”  

“Good.” She nodded, her expression one of relief.  

With her permission, I slowly placed my hand on her robe. Carefully, I undid the front, loosening the knots and pulling the protruding tie. The fabric parted with a soft rustle, revealing what lay beneath.  

My gaze fixed on her. First, I saw the valley of her breasts, cradled by her underwear. Lower, her slender waist, graceful hips, and long, elegant legs came into view. She was beautiful, exuding a noble grace, like a crane in flight.  

I lifted my eyes again, drawn to the alluring curve of her chest. I reached out, gently caressing her face. She mirrored me, her hand brushing my cheek. Her short, wavy hair spilled beautifully across the pillow. With my other hand, I fully opened her robe.  

Outside, darkness had fully settled. The only light in the dim room was a single beam of moonlight streaming through the window. Perhaps embarrassed by her exposed body in that glow, Ha-yeon turned her gaze away slightly. Her vulnerability was striking, and I spoke in a quiet voice.  
“Ha-yeon, if this is too much, we can stop.”  

“It’s not too much. I’m just… a little shy…”  

It must have been her first time, as she seemed overwhelmed with embarrassment. She kept crossing her legs and covering her chest with her arms, avoiding my gaze.  

I smiled gently, accepting her actions and waiting patiently. This was her first time, and I wouldn’t rush her. I wanted to avoid forcing anything in haste. My goal was to create a good memory for her, not a painful one, even if it meant taking time that might feel tedious.  

Our relationship was simple: she would stay by my side, and I would protect and care for her. Before meeting me, Ha-yeon had been adrift, unable to find her footing. I did have plans to use her for my own goals, but as long as she sought me as her refuge, I was confident I could be her steadfast shield.  

I waited calmly. Noticing my patience, her arms, which had been tightly wrapped around her chest, and her clenched legs began to relax. Looking at me as I gazed down at her, she spoke in a soft voice.  
“That expression just now…”  

“Hm?”  

“It was nice. Show it more often.”  

I tilted my head at her cryptic words but moved my hand again. I further loosened her half-undone robe. Between the fabric of her underwear, I saw the deep valley of her chest and the gentle curve of her breasts. I placed my hand on them, slowly pulling the fabric down.  

*Pop. Pop. Thud.*  

“Ah…!”  

As I fully removed her underwear, her breasts, freed from their restraint, trembled slightly, revealing themselves. Two perfect, white mounds. Entranced, I fixed my gaze on them. Bathed in moonlight, they glowed with a serene yet seductive allure, untouchable yet inviting.  

“Please… don’t stare like that…”  

“They’re beautiful. You’re stunning.”  

Her faint, mosquito-like voice prompted an immediate response. My words weren’t flattery—they were sincere. Her face flushed red, and she turned her head aside while lying down.  

I’d felt it once before due to an accident, but her breasts were even larger and fuller than they appeared. Not overwhelmingly so, nor too small—just the perfect size, with a softness that seemed to melt under touch.  

“How old are you?” she asked, perhaps uncomfortable with my focus on her chest.  

I swallowed and answered, “Twenty-four.”  

“Oh, two years younger than me.”  

I already knew—Ha-yeon was twenty-six, at the peak of her feminine allure. I gently placed my hand on her captivating chest. She looked at me with a small smile.  
“…Pfft. Do you like them that much?”  

“Huh?”  

“You’ve been staring at them nonstop. It’s not like you. You’re finally acting a bit your age.”  

I laughed inwardly at her response. Did she realize I was doing this on purpose? From her actions—embracing me, letting me rest on her lap or chest—I sensed a maternal warmth in her.  

I was trying my best to be considerate. Perhaps because of that, her initial tension had eased, and she now looked far more relaxed. Taking it further, she grabbed my hand, which had paused in midair, and guided it to her chest.  

The moment my palm touched her, I felt her body quiver. My fingers grazed the soft mound below. The sensation enveloped my hand, and I could feel her trembling.  

She made no sound—no cries of pain, no moans. She held back, perhaps out of concern for me, enduring silently. Accepting her kindness, I placed my left hand on her other breast.  

The softness seemed as if it would melt away with the slightest pressure. I savored the way her breasts yielded under my touch, their shape shifting with my movements. I gently pinched the raised peaks, moving my fingers once or twice. Finally, she let out a faint, fevered moan and twisted her body slightly. But she quickly closed her mouth, stilling her movements. The unfiltered sensation of her smooth skin was intoxicating, urging me to move my hands with even more fervor.  

After lingering on her chest for a while, I pulled back. Her once-pale breasts now bore a faint flush. I shifted my gaze downward. By now, we’d stopped speaking, both of us wholly focused on each other’s actions.  

She was left in only her lower undergarments. I leaned back slightly, taking in her entire form. Narrow shoulders, full and beautiful breasts, a delicate frame—I couldn’t help but marvel at her beauty.  

I gently traced my hand over her bare skin, gliding over her flawless waist and pausing near her navel. My fingers circled her slender, vertical navel before moving to her hips, which shyly revealed their graceful curve. Each touch drew a subtle reaction from Ha-yeon, her body twitching. Seeing this fresh side of her, so different from her usual calm and rational demeanor, I let a faint smile curl my lips.  

I leaned toward her face. Her elegant, intelligent features now held a yearning expression I’d never seen before. Drawn to that longing, I slowly closed the distance to her tightly shut, cherry-like lips.  

Noticing my intent, her eyes widened in surprise, her face briefly colored with panic. But she quickly regained her composure. Touched by her thoughtfulness, even in her inexperience, I felt an urge to kiss her.  

*Smack. Smack.*  

Our distance closed until I could hear her breathing. Though she’d maintained a composed demeanor at first, as I drew nearer, she shyly averted her gaze downward. Pausing, I spoke softly.  
“Can I… kiss you?”  

“…I’ve always wanted to try it. Go ahead.”  

Was this her first kiss too? With her permission, there was no need to hesitate. I carefully pressed my lips to hers, fragrant and inviting. She flinched briefly at the contact but then accepted my lips, moving hers slightly, almost awkwardly.  

The sensation of her lips was sweet, soft, and warm. For a moment, I wished I could fall asleep in that embrace.
