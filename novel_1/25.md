# Memorize - Chapter 24: The City of Traps

The morning of the next day dawned. After talking with An-hyeon at dawn, I returned to my room, where we managed to arrange shifts for keeping watch and tending to the injured. Despite being told it was fine and to rest more, An-hyeon insisted on taking over, leaving me no choice. Deciding to catch a quick nap, I lay down in a corner of the living room, but it seems I ended up falling into a deep sleep. I resolved to reflect on this a bit.

Even if there was nothing to worry about for now, letting my guard down was dangerous. I might be the abnormal one here, but I’m the type who doesn’t feel satisfied unless I push myself to the absolute limit in everything I do. Over the past ten years, I’ve developed a habit of deliberately avoiding deep sleep or eating to fullness. Just as I was thinking it was time to pick up the pace and started to get up, I sensed someone nearby. Quietly opening my eyes, I saw, to my surprise, An-sol sitting demurely beside my makeshift bed.

“Oh!”

An-sol, who had been tilting her head back and forth with a fidgety expression, locked eyes with me, her eyes widening like saucers. There was no need to be *that* startled. I’m not your enemy, you know. I won’t hurt you. With that sentiment in mind, I greeted her softly, infusing my voice with warmth.

“Good morning. Are you feeling okay?”

“Ah, good morning… Did you sleep well?”

Her flustered yet polite response made me chuckle involuntarily. Oh, I really shouldn’t feel this way. Why does this girl make my heart soften so much? Her presence stirred an overwhelming urge to protect her. Slowly, I sat up. Watching my movements, she hesitated, then spoke in a voice as faint as a mosquito’s hum.

“O-oppa.”

“Yeah?”

“I’m sorry…”

“Huh?”

What’s she talking about now? I’ve been hearing “sorry” a lot lately, both yesterday and today. Looking at her with a puzzled expression, she lowered her head and continued.

“Um… I heard… that because of me… you went through a lot…”

Her words were so vague that someone unfamiliar with the situation might misunderstand. But seeing her stammer made me suddenly worry about her future. How would she survive in the harsh, extraordinary world of Hall Plane if she struggled to speak to others? The idea that this girl could one day rise to the level of the Shadow Queen or the Princess of Execution, becoming a Priest of Radiance, felt like a distant dream. With a half-hearted expression, I replied.

“No need to apologize. If anything, you did amazingly well. I heard you saved everyone’s lives.”

“N-no! I don’t even remember it clearly!”

Knowing that revealing my true thoughts would only deflate her further, I shook my head with a kind expression. My praise seemed to register, as her face brightened, and she began waving her hands with a shy, beaming smile. Everything she thought was written plain on her face—she was the epitome of a natural, innocent type. I couldn’t help but wonder how someone could raise a child to be this pure. Just then, I heard someone call me from behind.

“Su-hyeon orabeoni, if you’re awake, come eat.”

“?”

“Why are you looking at me with those questioning eyes?”

“?”

“Why do you keep—ugh, fine, I’ll drop it. An-hyeon told me Sol took care of nursing and keeping watch for us last night. I made breakfast to say thanks. Everyone else has already eaten, so don’t worry.”

“Hmm. That’s the Yu-jeong I know. Thanks.”

Nodding and reaching out, I watched as she placed a plate in front of me with a slightly annoyed expression. The menu was the same as yesterday: tuna crackers. I was tempted to tease her about only knowing how to make this, but her icy glare convinced me to keep my mouth shut.

“…”

“…”

I took a cracker and bit into it. Yu-jeong and An-sol sat quietly, watching me eat. Halfway through chewing one, I set it down with a dissatisfied look. Yu-jeong blinked, urging me to eat more, while An-sol, for some reason, kept smiling innocently. Were they all acting strange today or what?

“Do I look like a zoo monkey to you?”

“Not *that* bad. It’s just… your way of eating is interesting.”

“My way?”

*Not that bad*, huh. Was I eating that oddly? I was just eating as I always did… But a sudden thought struck me, and I froze.

“An-hyeon just chews a few times and swallows, but you’re the complete opposite. You nibble like a proper little lady, chewing slowly and carefully, swallowing bit by bit. And you don’t even eat much. Why do you eat like that?”

I couldn’t answer right away. Yu-jeong’s observation was unexpectedly sharp. The truth was, back when I was chased by fairies in the Fairy Forest, food was scarce. I had to ration what little I had, eating just enough to keep going each day, which formed this habit. Even now, when preparing for combat—whether leading a caravan or joining an expedition—I avoid eating to fullness to keep my senses sharp. Feeling full dulls one’s edge.

But I couldn’t say that outright, so I decided to change the subject.

“It’s just a habit. I eat normally, but in situations like this, I tend to eat less. By the way, where are the other two? I don’t see them.”

“An-hyeon and Kim Han-byeol? An-hyeon went to scout the area, and Han-byeol went up to the rooftop, I think.”

Seeing Yu-jeong answer without suspicion, I let out a quiet sigh of relief. But when I glanced over, An-sol was staring at me with bright, curious eyes. When our gazes met, she gave another shy smile. What was up with her today?

I couldn’t help but think An-sol was like a child. Children instinctively wary of strangers, fearing they might cause harm. If you approach them thoughtlessly, they’ll cry or push you away. The trick to getting close is simple: keep your distance at first, showing you mean no harm. Eventually, their curiosity takes over, and they’ll approach you. That’s the moment to connect.

Lost in these idle thoughts about An-sol, I chewed another cracker Yu-jeong had prepared and sank into deeper reflection. If we counted a day based on 24:00, today was the second day since we entered this Trap Point. That meant until midnight tonight, we were still in a safe period. Though no one said it outright, everyone seemed to like this place quite a bit.

“I hope they come back soon. I’ve got things to discuss.”

“What kind of things? Like what we should do next?”

“Something like that.”

“What’s it about, oppa? Tell me and Sol first.”

Yu-jeong, sitting with her knees together and arms wrapped around them, looked at me with curiosity. An-sol, hearing talk of the future, seemed to tense up slightly. What I was about to say might spark some pushback, but I decided to be direct. It was something they all needed to know, no matter how hard it was to say.

“I think we should leave this city today.”

As soon as I spoke, both of their faces froze, just as I’d expected.

*

“I just went on a quick patrol. Like you said, hyung, it’s eerily quiet out there.”

An-hyeon’s first words upon entering through the front door were about how suspiciously silent the city was. With my mention of having something to discuss, everyone had gathered in the living room, including me. Kim Han-byeol, perhaps having cleared her mind with some fresh air, had regained her usual cool and composed demeanor. I scanned their faces before speaking.

“I’m sure all of you heard something from the angels before coming to this place called the Rite of Passage.”

“Well, I don’t remember much. I was too busy arguing with that winged girl to hear anything.”

Yu-jeong’s head tilt and response made me give a wry smile. Setting her aside for now, I turned to An-hyeon and Kim Han-byeol. They thought for a moment before speaking up one by one.

“I read the precautions, but there were so many… Something about finding your own food and water, that death here means real death, and the survival condition is reaching the central warp gate… and, uh, what else was there?”

“Surviving for seven days.”

Kim Han-byeol supplemented An-hyeon’s answer, and that was exactly the point I was waiting for.

“That’s it. Survive for seven days. Han-byeol-ssi, do you remember any other details attached to that condition?”

At my question, Kim Han-byeol’s face briefly showed a flicker of dissatisfaction before she answered.

“I remember. They specifically told us not to settle in one place. We either keep moving for seven days or head to the central warp gate.”

I nodded in agreement, about to continue, when Yu-jeong quickly jumped in, cutting me off.

“But oppa, this place is safe, isn’t it? There’s plenty of food, we slept well, and there’s shelter. Don’t you remember how much we suffered as soon as we left the forest?”

“Yeah, hyung. Do we really have to leave? Do we have to believe everything those angels said?”

An-hyeon backed her up, questioning me, and Yu-jeong looked at me with a brighter expression, clearly reluctant to leave. I met their gazes and spoke in a calm voice.

“You’re all thinking too complacently just because things are comfortable right now. Let’s try thinking the opposite way.”

“The opposite?”

“Yes. An-hyeon, you just patrolled and saw how unnaturally quiet this city is. In the forest, we were constantly on edge, and even after leaving, you all got attacked. It’ll probably be the same if we go outside. But…”

I paused for a moment before continuing.

“The angels don’t want us to act this way. They warned us explicitly: survive seven days, reach the central warp gate, and never settle in one place. We need to understand what they want. The Rite of Passage and our current situation don’t align. Doesn’t this place seem strange? Compared to the outside, it’s comfortable, there’s food, and no monsters. I think this is a trap. I have a bad feeling that if we stay here longer, something will happen.”

“…So you’re saying we should leave because you have a bad feeling?”

“I know it’s hard to accept based on a hunch. But I’m telling you, I feel an unsettling vibe. Places like this are best for resting just enough, gathering what we need, and moving on. That’s the most efficient way. I’d prefer we leave before the day is over.”

Even as I tried to persuade them, I wasn’t confident I could convince them. Convincing people in a dangerous situation versus a safe one is vastly different. My argument wasn’t entirely without logic, but it relied heavily on intuition and foresight. That was unavoidable—there’s a gap between those who know Hall Plane and those who don’t.

For a while, no one spoke, but their reluctant expressions made it clear they didn’t want to leave. Sure, I could deal with any boss monster myself, but since this was a place set up by the angels, I wanted them to follow the standard path. The more comfortable they got here, the harder they’d find it in Hall Plane later. An-hyeon looked into my eyes, then turned to the group and spoke.

“Since we all seem to have different opinions… let’s vote.”

“A vote?”

“Yes, but with two conditions.”

“What conditions?”

His unexpected suggestion piqued my interest. A vote—now that was a term I hadn’t heard in a while. Kim Han-byeol also seemed intrigued and asked, prompting An-hyeon to nod slightly and explain.

“It’s simple. First, each person chooses one option: agree, disagree, or abstain, and they must explain their reasoning. Second, whatever the outcome, we all follow it without complaints.”

At An-hyeon’s words, Yu-jeong, confident that staying would win, spoke in a lively tone.

“Agree, agree! No objections here. A vote sounds great. Let’s do it now. I’ll go first!”

“Alright, the sooner, the better. Su-hyeon hyung gets one vote for leaving, since he already explained his reasons.”

“No objections.”

“Then… does anyone have a different opinion? If not, we’ll proceed.”

With Kim Han-byeol, An-sol, and me agreeing, An-hyeon nodded and turned to Yu-jeong. Slowly, her mouth opened, and everyone focused on what she was about to say.
