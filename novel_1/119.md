# Chapter 118: Interesting

Although Ha-yeon said she was fine, I escorted her to her door. Back in the modern world, when I spent a night with a woman, we’d often wake up together in the morning and share a meal. They say even a brush of sleeves creates a bond, so I thought it was only polite not to slip away without a word. Of course, back then, I still had a certain innocence that made such gestures possible. And now, these small acts were all I could offer Ha-yeon.

After seeing her into her room, I headed toward the private room I used for business. Just as I reached for the doorknob, the door swung open abruptly.

“Oh, Leader!”

The man standing before me, wearing glasses, was none other than Shin Sang-yong. His face was slightly flushed, and he looked startled to see me.

“Done sightseeing?” I asked.

“Oh, no, haha. I’m just grabbing something on Master’s orders.”

“I see…”

“Yes, well, I’ll leave you to your conversation.”

Seemingly in a hurry, Shin Sang-yong bowed his head and brushed past me. I couldn’t help but wonder what kind of discussion had taken place inside to make the usually reserved Shin Sang-yong act like that. Curiosity piqued, I stepped into the room and saw Vivian nodding to herself as she surveyed the space. She turned her head toward the door as she sensed my presence.

“Kim Su-hyeon?”

“Yeah.”

“Finished your talk?”

“Yep. By the way, what do you think of this room? Can it be converted into a workshop? Of course, we’d have to consider dismantling it carefully—we can’t damage the inn.”

“Hmm…”

Vivian let out a soft hum at my question, then began eyeing me cautiously. Wondering why she was acting so oddly, I furrowed my brow. She reached into her pocket and pulled out an object with long legs. As she put it on her face, I couldn’t help but stare in disbelief.

“What… is that?”

“Huh? You don’t know? Shin Sang-yong said it’s called glasses.”

“Glasses? Don’t joke around,” I wanted to say, but the proud glint in her eyes made me instinctively hold my tongue.

“Alright… but how do you have those?”

“How? Have you forgotten my profession? I can make something as simple as this with my eyes closed. So, what do you think?”

It’s true that some modern items could be recreated in the Hall Plane. Still, what Vivian was wearing could hardly be called glasses—it was almost embarrassing to look at. Noticing my odd expression, she puffed out her cheeks and spoke up.

“Hmph. What’s wrong with these glasses? They suit me, don’t they?”

“No one said otherwise. But do you really need to make something so useless just because it suits you? You’re not a kid.”

At my criticism, Vivian’s face flushed with indignation.

“They’re harmless, aren’t they? Alchemists are naturally curious, you know!”

“They make you look like a foreigner. They don’t suit you.”

“Excuse me?!”

Vivian let out a sharp cry, her face contorting as she roughly yanked off the glasses. She huffed and puffed for a moment before letting out a deep sigh and shaking her head. Was she… rebelling?

“…Ugh. Anyway, let’s get to the point. What’s this favor you’re asking for that requires setting up a workshop?”

I was tempted to tease her a bit more, but her weary voice pulled me back. Realizing the glasses weren’t the priority, I reached into my pocket and pulled out two items.

The moment Vivian saw them, her eyes sparkled.

“Kim Su-hyeon, these are…”

Her alchemist’s eye was sharp, as expected. She swallowed hard the instant she saw the two items. I held them up one by one, explaining.

“Right. One is a demon’s heart extracted from Belphegor’s body in the laboratory. The other is a kind of spirit core that served as the central component in your body. Speaking of which… Shin Sang-yong’s not here.”

“I sent him to fetch something… Wait, Kim Su-hyeon, are you saying…”

Vivian, who had been responding calmly, trailed off as if something clicked when she mentioned Shin Sang-yong. I nodded once in confirmation, and her face lit up with astonishment before she closed her eyes, slipping into her own world. I waited patiently.

Mages and alchemists often get like this—it’s part of their profession. It’s one reason I prefer working with them; they catch on quickly without needing lengthy explanations. Of course, it’s a problem if they get too lost in their thoughts, but for now, I decided to wait quietly for her to speak.

Though her eyes were closed, Vivian’s lips moved rapidly as she muttered to herself. I leaned in to catch her words.

“…It’s definitely possible. But the demon’s heart is too steeped in demonic energy… Oh, if Kim Su-hyeon can purify it like last time, that changes things. Right. Hmm. It could work. My core is of a slightly lower grade, true, but having been steeped in mana flow for so long, it’s more than just a mana stone. Assuming no conflict occurs, the grade doesn’t matter as much. But the efficiency would be quite low. Right. That’s why we need Shin Sang-yong. The two issues could be resolved in one go with that harmony magic circle or whatever it’s called… It’s not entirely impossible…”

Her brow furrowed deeper as her thoughts grew more complex. Muttering rapidly with a serious expression, she finally opened her eyes and addressed me.

“You want to process them using Shin Sang-yong’s harmony magic circle, don’t you?”

“Exactly. Spot on.”

“Well… it’s a bit hard to say ‘definitely.’ It’s really tricky.”

“Let’s give it a try. I won’t blame you if it fails.”

At my words, Vivian’s face took on a wounded expression. She tapped her lips with her slender fingers and shook her head firmly.

“Kim Su-hyeon, I think we should hold off on building the workshop.”

“Huh? Why?”

Her refusal caught me off guard, and I felt a pang of confusion. Seeing my reaction, Vivian sighed and began to explain calmly.

“I’m not saying we shouldn’t do it, just that we should delay. Simply put, this place is too crude. I could whip up a couple of simple potions, but processing materials like those, with the kind of procedure you’re envisioning, isn’t feasible here. We could force it, sure, but the chances of success would be too low. I mean… I acknowledge the possibility. I’m a bit flustered, and my words are jumbled, but I don’t want to do it now. It’s not urgent, right?”

“So, you’re saying it’s a waste of materials?”

Vivian nodded solemnly.

“Yes. Alchemists always challenge the impossible to turn possibilities into reality, but that’s when materials aren’t a concern. Using such high-potential, quality materials in a mere inn like this is just too wasteful. Even a specialized workshop would be iffy… If we get proper equipment and add more materials to the process, we could drastically improve the odds.”

“Hmm…”

“If you insist on pushing forward despite these conditions, I’ll comply. But as the alchemist Vivian, I’m asking you to hold off for now. Just trust me this once.”

Her words were logical and unwavering, unlike before. It wasn’t about whether it could be done—it was about the odds of success. She’d follow my orders without complaint if I insisted, but I had little to argue against. I smacked my lips and made up my mind.

“Well, they do say the more urgent it is, the more you should take your time.”

“I’ve never heard that, but it’s a good saying. Smart choice. Hehe.”

Pleased that I’d taken her advice, Vivian flashed a pretty smile. I gazed at her quietly. The more I saw her, the more her old personality seemed to fade. It wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, considering what lay ahead, but I couldn’t help feeling a twinge of regret.

I sighed and tucked the two items back into my pocket. On reflection, I’d been a bit hasty, blinded by the prospect of boosting my stamina points. Seeing Vivian’s approving look, I asked in a skeptical tone, “You’re not acting like your usual self. It’s almost suspicious.”

At my doubt, Vivian snorted and let out a chuckle. For some reason, that irritated me. It wasn’t a situation that warranted anger, but I felt it bubbling up. She sighed dramatically and spoke in a teasing tone.

“Ugh, Kim Su-hyeon. My name is Vivian La Clarté. My homeland may be gone, but I once carried its name with great pride. Now that I’m human again, I’m regaining my former rationality. So, don’t expect me to act childish like before. Even I’m embarrassed thinking about those days. And for the record, I’m 24 in human years. I’d appreciate being treated my age.”

She explained all this calmly, but her tone and attitude rubbed me the wrong way. Tilting my head for a moment, I stepped closer and raised my hand. Despite my somewhat threatening posture, Vivian just scoffed.

“Pfft. Stop that. How long are you going to treat me like a kid? I’m a skilled alchemist, you know. No matter how much you—”

Mid-sentence, I channeled the power of Hwa-jeong into my hand. As a clear flame flickered to life, Vivian paused. She quickly resumed speaking, trying to appear unfazed, but I could tell—she’d been terrified the moment I summoned Hwa-jeong.

“…You think I’d blink at that? While we’re on the subject, back in the day, I was—”

Ignoring her chatter, I lightly snapped my fingers.

“Huh?”

*Snap!* The sound echoed through the room as a spark of Hwa-jeong caught in Vivian’s hair. I had no real intent to harm her—Hwa-jeong, a mythical power, could be controlled precisely. It was just a flame on her hair, nothing more, but Vivian had no way of knowing that.

“Kyaa! Kyaah! KYAAAAH! You actually did it! You really did it!” she screamed, running around the room in a panic. She rubbed her head against the bed and hopped up and down. In an instant, her composed demeanor vanished, replaced by a frantic dance. I raised my hand again.

Her reaction was immediate.

“Waaah! Stop it! Don’t bully me! Waaah…”

“Hmm. Yep, that’s the Vivian I know. Thought you were someone else for a second.”

Muttering to myself in a calm tone, I snapped my fingers again, extinguishing the flame. Like a startled animal, Vivian frantically checked her hair, confirming her jet-black locks were intact. She gritted her teeth in frustration.

“You…! What was that for?! And what’s that supposed to mean?!”

“Oh, I thought you were a doppelgänger. If you were a monster, I was going to take you down…”

“That’s your excuse?! You absolute jerk! What did I do wrong?! If you keep acting like this, I’ll—”

“Oh?”

As she ranted, I pulled out the contract I always kept close and waved it lightly. The moment she saw it, Vivian froze, her face a mix of shock and exasperation. She stared at me, speechless, her eyes welling up as she forced a trembling smile. Her eyes wanted to cry, but her mouth tried to laugh. It was a bit pitiful, but honestly, it was pretty funny.

Stifling a laugh, I spoke in a composed voice. “What was that about?”

“Uh, huh? W-what did I say?”

“Something about… what?”

“I-I called you a jerk, didn’t I?” she stammered, her face paling. She took a deep breath, but tears brimmed in her eyes despite her efforts. Still, she forced a smile.

“Hoho… hohoho… I-I got a bit carried away… *sniff*… please… hoho… waaah…”

Unable to hold back her emotions any longer, Vivian burst into tears, sobbing loudly. I quickly moved to calm her down.
