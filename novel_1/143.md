# Chapter 142: The End of Training

I stared at her with a look of confusion. Reading the puzzlement on my face, Go Yeon-ju widened her eyes and asked, “Oh? You didn’t know? There’s been a tail on us ever since we left Mul. Didn’t you march at that breakneck pace to shake them off?”

“Ahh.”

Her detailed explanation finally made things click. I had indeed sensed a few Users trailing us when we left Mul. I’d assumed they weren’t vagrants but rather Users envious of our rapid growth. Mul was already short on Users, so it made sense that anyone with a shred of awareness would take notice of us returning from expeditions decked out in high-quality gear.

Still, I couldn’t help but tilt my head again. I hadn’t pushed the rapid march specifically to lose them, though it could’ve served that purpose. For them to keep up with our pace, they couldn’t be complete novices. After a moment of thought, I asked her in a calm voice, “We must’ve put some distance between us within a day. Are they still following? And how did you know, User Go Yeon-ju?”

“It’s less that they’re chasing us and more that they’re keeping a steady distance,” she replied. “They’ve got a decent archer who’s tracking our traces. And have you forgotten who I am? I’ve had a shadow on them since day one.”

Her soft response clarified her earlier words. Keep the tail or shake it off. She meant that if we camped here, they’d be close enough to catch up. I still wasn’t sure if they were just curious Users or actual vagrants, but I hated being followed. After a brief hum, I made up my mind without much deliberation.

“We’ll camp here,” I said.

“Shaking them off, then. But they seem cautious. Will they fall for it so easily? We’ve got eight people on our side,” Go Yeon-ju remarked.

“No need for everyone to move. If they don’t come to us, we’ll go to them.”

“Hmm?”

At my words, Go Yeon-ju let out a soft hum through her nose. She narrowed her eyes slightly, studying my face. After a moment, she spoke in a low voice, “We could get help from the others. Or I could assist you.”

“No need. We’re close to the Screaming Cave, and I don’t want to disrupt the group’s momentum. It’s fine.”

“What about me?”

“Stay at the base camp, User Go Yeon-ju. We need to prepare for any possibility. I can handle this alone.”

“…You just want to do it alone, don’t you?”

Her sharp words hit the mark, and I fell silent. It felt like she’d jabbed right into my thoughts. Seeing my reaction, a faint smile curled on her lips.

I met her gaze calmly, then turned away. I didn’t want to continue this conversation. Go Yeon-ju and I were alike in some ways—too alike, perhaps. She’d seen right through me.

“You know,” she said, “that was the first time you’ve smiled since we set out.”

I smiled? I hadn’t noticed. My hand drifted to my lips, and her voice caught me again from behind. “The kids might not be much help—probably more of a hindrance. Fine, I’ll stay. Just watch out for the bats.”

I raised a hand in acknowledgment and approached the group, who were gathered nearby.

“We’ll camp here for the night,” I announced. “It’s a bit early, but the timing’s awkward.”

The group looked surprised at the early halt, but relief flickered across their faces. They didn’t seem to mind. We set up camp and began preparing an early dinner. I mentioned we’d rise early to move out, so they’d likely turn in soon. Watching their brightened expressions as they ate, I spoke quietly.

“Tonight’s watch will follow yesterday’s schedule, with a slight change.”

The group perked up, listening intently. I subtly activated my detection, confirming a presence nearby, and raised my voice as if to ensure it was heard.

“We’ve had one person per shift, but tonight we’ll extend the shifts and have two people per rotation. There’s a reason for this.” I hoped there was someone sharp among the pursuers—someone who’d make this easier by revealing their intentions.

“The first shift will be me and User Go Yeon-ju. After that, pair up as you did yesterday, excluding us.”

“Kim Su-hyeon, do we really need two people?” Vivian raised her hand.

I nodded. “Yeah, I think we need to tighten security. Especially in these mountains. Two-person shifts are standard. We’ve been short-handed before, but not anymore. I meant to make this change from the start but forgot. Now’s a good time to start.”

“Hmm, two is definitely better than one,” Shin Sang-yong chimed in. “I’ve been wondering whether to suggest it. Glad you were already thinking about it.”

“Exactly. With all the dense foliage and trees, visibility’s limited. One person can guard the camp while the other patrols lightly. It’ll maximize efficiency.”

“I’m in,” Shin Sang-yong said, seeking safety as always.

A quiet ripple of agreement spread through the group. My reasoning was sound, and they couldn’t argue. The watch schedule was settled unanimously.

Some minor chatter followed as they sorted out their pairings. After confirming their partners, they resumed eating. An-sol, relieved her partner wasn’t Go Yeon-ju, suddenly turned toward the thick brush with a puzzled look.

“Hmm…?”

“Sol, what’s wrong?” An-hyeon asked.

“It feels like someone’s watching us…”

The moment she spoke, a black bird—a bat—burst from the bushes with a flutter and soared into the sky. An-hyeon dismissed it casually. “Just a bird. No big deal. Don’t worry, let’s eat. Try this soup—it’s amazing.”

“A bird? It didn’t seem like one… Ugh, stop it! I can eat on my own!” An-sol pouted, pushing away the spoonful of soup An-hyeon offered.

As An-hyeon lowered the spoon, I exchanged a meaningful glance with Go Yeon-ju.

We finished dinner and prepared to sleep. The group chatted briefly, but the warm meal left them drowsy. One by one, they slipped into their sleeping bags. I leaned against a tree, noting there was still some time before nightfall.

---

The mountains darkened quickly. Sipping tea, I watched the twilight settle. Tea during an expedition, teetering between life and death, felt out of place, but Go Yeon-ju had brewed it, and it was surprisingly good. I couldn’t ignore her effort.

As I brought the cup to my lips again, she gave me a subtle glance. I sipped calmly, pretending not to notice.

She spoke first. “Night watch is pretty boring.”

“Boring but important.”

“Not even a rat’s shown up, let alone a monster.”

I stretched with a loud yawn, replying in a sleepy tone, “Yeah, true. Shift change is soon, so hang in there. A quick patrol should time it perfectly.”

“Sounds like a hassle. Do we really need to?”

“You never know. I’ll do a quick sweep. Stay here. When I’m back, we’ll swap with the others. But first, I want to finish this tea.”

Our conversation was deliberately casual, just loud enough to be overheard. I savored the tea slowly, drop by drop. I’d chosen the first shift with Go Yeon-ju to catch the pursuers if they rushed us while we slept, but they weren’t that reckless. They were either waiting for an opening or had some other plan.

After nearly thirty minutes of dawdling, I stood, brushing myself off. I told Go Yeon-ju I’d be back and stepped into the brush. Immediately, I sensed a presence tailing me discreetly.

I’d said I’d patrol lightly, but I put some distance between myself and the camp, isolating myself from the group. I briefly considered pretending to get lost but decided it might seem too suspicious. Instead, I walked calmly, deliberately deactivating my Third Eye and detection. If I sensed them early, my body might instinctively react. I wanted to play the bait perfectly.

About ten minutes into the patrol, as curiosity about their next move stirred, a piercing screech tore through the air. A dark shadow shot up from the knee-high brush. They were finally making their move. It was the bat that had been lurking around us. Feigning surprise, I spun around as it grazed my shoulder.

“Ugh, you little—!”

Grimacing, I drew my sword. The bat, as if mocking me, darted through the air, weaving around. I swung clumsily, and it dodged effortlessly, occasionally lunging at my arm.

Whoever was controlling this bat seemed to know I was a Year 0 User. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have set such a flimsy trap. Sure, I hadn’t fought much in the seven days since leaving Mul, but this was practically an insult. Biting my lip, I swung my sword widely, playing along despite the irritation.

Then it happened.

“Kyaaak!”

The bat shrieked in pain, spiraling upward before fleeing unsteadily. One of its wings had caught on my wild swing—purely by chance. Even I was baffled. It was too obvious. I was dying to know who was behind this, but I had to keep up the act.

“Stop right there, you pest!” I shouted, chasing after the bat.
