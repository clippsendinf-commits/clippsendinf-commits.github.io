# Memorize - Chapter 37: To the Hall Plane!

The barrier vanished, and the tightly shut inn door swung open. As soon as it did, a group of people surged inside. Judging by their appearance, they were existing Users who had already been admitted to this world.

The place where I now found myself was a major city in the Northern Continent, called Barbara. As one of the few major cities, each situated in a different continent, the Users based here exuded a sharp, formidable presence, each clearly capable in their own right.

They all wore an emblem of a golden lion on the right side of their chests—a symbol I recognized immediately. The Golden Lion Clan of the Northern Continent. I recalled them as a clan that had left a significant mark on the Hall Plane. Though they would later weaken due to an overambitious expedition and conflicts with rival clans, leading to their eventual downfall, that was a story for another time.

A towering figure, easily over 190 cm, clad in a plain priest’s robe that seemed at odds with his sturdy frame, scanned the inn and spoke in a surprised tone.

“Hall Two has more people than expected, huh?”

His words weren’t directed at us. The other Users who followed him in seemed to share his sentiment. One of them calmly counted the number of survivors before nodding and responding.

“Wow, forty-three new Users in Hall Two. It’s been a while since we’ve seen a baby boom like this.”

“Isn’t this close to a record high?”

“Well, compared to last year… for a single hall, it’s definitely a lot. How are the other halls doing?”

The survivors—new Users—watched the existing Users whispering among themselves with uneasy expressions. Yet, even amidst the tension, some were sharply observing their surroundings or listening intently to the conversation. I made a mental note of their faces.

“They’re probably tallying it up now. Hyung Park Hyeon-woo is coming from Hall One. Everyone, line up.”

At the mention of the name “Hyeon-woo,” the chattering Users quickly formed orderly rows on either side of the inn’s entrance. Hyeon-woo. Golden Lion Clan. Connecting those two words sparked a memory. If my guess was correct, Park Hyeon-woo, who would later become a high-ranking executive of the clan, might be the one to appear.

Soon, a man strode confidently through the center of the lined-up Users. He had a clean-cut, handsome face, youthful but sharp. Though he looked a bit younger than I remembered from my first cycle, the look in his eyes confirmed my suspicion: this was Park Hyeon-woo. I subtly heightened my mana and activated my Third Eye.

As expected, it was Park Hyeon-woo. His endurance and agility stats weren’t particularly impressive, but as a Sword Expert, he still had room to grow. If he could climb a couple more ranks, he might even reach Sword Master status. I recalled that during the First Coalition War, he was known as the Phantom Sword Master.

He wasn’t someone I’d ever crossed swords with directly, despite his early fame. His agility was a weak point, but his mana was decent for a swordsman, which likely compensated for it to some extent.

For now, I decided to set aside my interest in him. I’d heard he was killed during the coalition war when the Golden Lion Clan was decimated. Besides, as a member of a major clan, he was unlikely to become an ally.

While I was lost in thought, the new Users’ attention had shifted to Park Hyeon-woo. He walked in slowly, scrutinizing our faces. A moment later, he showed a hint of surprise before speaking in a calm tone.

“Hall Two has quite a number of new Users. Looks like over forty.”

“Forty-three, to be exact. How many survived in Hall One?”

“Nineteen. Anyway, it’s good news. Sort them by class and have them gather in the plaza. The new Users from Halls Three, Four, and Five will be brought over soon.”

Answering the giant’s question, Park Hyeon-woo left the inn with an impassive expression.

The plaza was bustling with countless Users. Returning to Barbara’s central plaza after so long felt refreshing. The plaza wasn’t anything extraordinary—just a sunken, circular stage surrounded by tiered steps, somewhat like an open-air theater.

The new Users were divided by class, seated on the steps. The cold seeping up from the brick chilled my backside, but I endured it and turned my gaze to the central stage.

There, Users bearing the Golden Lion emblem moved in unison. Some of them eyed us with smug curiosity, as if we were animals in a zoo.

To someone familiar with the Hall Plane’s dynamics, Barbara’s situation was relatively decent. The Western Continent, managed by American Users, had an open policy toward all races, attracting a sizable population. It was called the Continent of Freedom, but its public safety wasn’t exactly stellar.

The Northern Continent, managed by South Korea, was home to the Golden Lion Clan, considered the greatest clan in existence. I’d heard their internal discipline was strict, though they could come off as a bit arrogant.

I was currently separated from my party. It wasn’t just me—most new Users were split from their original groups. The existing Users had sorted us by class, arranging us as they saw fit.

I was curious about what classes An-hyeon and the others had chosen, but I decided to save that discovery for later. Brushing aside idle thoughts, I turned my attention back to the stage, where Park Hyeon-woo was speaking with a few others. With nothing else to do, I quietly channeled mana to sharpen my hearing, hoping to catch snippets of their conversation.

“Report on the numbers. Hall One: 19. Hall Two: 43. Hall Three: 22. Hall Four: 29. Hall Five: 17. Total: 130.”

“Class breakdown?”

“Melee combat: 75. Ranged combat: 26. Mana talent: 18. Priests: 11. No Secret, Rare, or other special classes.”

“…I see. Let’s get started then. Yu-bin, set up the voice amplification spell. And bring that guy to me.”

That guy? Who were they talking about? Now that I thought about it, there had been some commotion in Hall Two as we left, but I hadn’t had time to investigate, caught up in the shuffle with the waiting Users.

My question was answered soon enough. Park Hyeon-woo dragged a battered man onto the central stage. The moment he stepped up, the low murmurs in the crowd fell silent. The plaza became so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Hyeon-woo hauled the man up with one arm and tossed him forward.

It was none other than Park Dong-geol. Frothing at the mouth, his right arm twisted grotesquely, he looked utterly pathetic. He twitched occasionally, clearly not fully unconscious, his face contorted in pain.

The other existing Users didn’t spare him a glance, ignoring his groans. Park Hyeon-woo addressed the crowd of new Users.

“I’m pleased to meet all of you who have passed the Rite of Passage. I’ll skip the small talk—you’ve likely heard most of it from the angels already. However.”

He paused briefly, letting the moment linger before continuing. Everyone was hanging on his words.

“There’s one thing we need to make clear. Everyone here, including us, were once citizens of South Korea. Like you, we all went through the Rite of Passage. The only difference between us and you is this: we came to the Hall Plane first, and you came later. In other words…”

Thanks to the voice amplification spell, his words resonated powerfully, reaching every one of the 130 Users clearly. He stepped forward, standing over the fallen Park Dong-geol.

“We are not here to send you back home.”

His words sent a ripple of unrest through the new Users. It was understandable. Even if the angels had explained things, hearing it confirmed so publicly in a setting like this was bound to spark disappointment. Park Hyeon-woo, unfazed, scanned the crowd quietly before speaking again in a softer tone.

“I know full well that you were dragged into this wretched Hall Plane against your will, and it’s unfair. We’ve been through the same thing—some of us still are. You’re probably wondering why we’re here. Our purpose is simple: to help you adapt to the Hall Plane, to survive, to guide you through the early stages.”

He paused again, looking down at Park Dong-geol. Even in his pain, Dong-geol’s pride seemed intact, his body trembling with humiliation. But the moment he met Hyeon-woo’s gaze, he quickly looked away. I couldn’t help but smirk inwardly.

“To put it simply, think of us as high-level players in an online game helping out newbies. But this man,” he gestured to Dong-geol, “insulted and verbally attacked one of the Users here to guide you. Of course, we respect your freedom and rights. If you don’t trust us or don’t want our help, that’s fine. For those who don’t wish to be guided, I’m giving you a chance right now. If you don’t want our assistance, stand up and leave this plaza. We won’t stop you, not in the slightest.”

No one spoke. No one stood. A heavy silence enveloped the plaza. After a moment, confirming no one had moved, Park Hyeon-woo nodded once or twice.

“No one? Very well. Those who remain will be considered willing to accept our guidance. Be warned: if any of you cause harm to other Users through deviant behavior, we may take appropriate measures. Guidance involves a degree of control, but if you find it excessive, you’re free to opt out at any time. Keep that in mind. Now, Yu-bin, cancel the voice amplification spell.”

As the mage named Yu-bin dispelled the spell, their voices faded. Park Hyeon-woo called over a priest and pointed at Park Dong-geol, giving some instructions. I quickly reactivated my mana-enhanced hearing.

The priest was the giant from the inn. A priest with that physique—what an odd combination. The towering figure knelt beside the fallen Dong-geol, leaning forward. He raised a hand glowing with holy light and moved it toward Dong-geol’s right arm.

“Recover.”

*Flash!*

The moment the giant uttered the word, his glowing hand flared brilliantly. The light seeped into Dong-geol’s arm, and the grotesquely twisted limb gradually realigned itself. Some new Users gasped in awe at the sight.

Dong-geol’s eyes blinked rapidly, clearly stunned by the healing. He groaned as he sat up, testing his arm, which appeared fully restored. Park Hyeon-woo watched him with an impassive gaze before speaking quietly.

“Stand.”

Dong-geol scrambled to his feet with startling speed, the classic behavior of someone weak before the strong but cruel to the weak. Hyeon-woo, clearly displeased, grimaced slightly before growling.

“Even as a new User, defying a member of the Golden Lion Clan, the leading clan in Barbara, is madness. I’ll let this slide just this once, but if it happens again…”

I could sense a deliberate edge of killing intent in his words. Dong-geol, picking up on the faint menace, nodded frantically.

At a signal from Hyeon-woo, the priest led Dong-geol to join the melee combat group. Once he confirmed Dong-geol’s compliance, Park Hyeon-woo turned back to face us.
