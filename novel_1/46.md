# Memorize - Chapter 45: Preparations for Takeoff

The woman set the meal down with gentle hands and retreated with refined steps, a stark contrast to her earlier movements. The food on the table consisted of a vegetable salad, toasted bread, cream stew, and meat pie—nothing extravagant. Honestly, though I’d ordered the A-course, it felt a bit lacking to call it a proper course meal. Still, compared to other dishes, it was affordable and tasted decent, as I recalled.

The atmosphere wasn’t exactly conducive to lively chatter over food. Even so, hunger being the best seasoning, An-hyeon was the first to pick up his spoon. I scooped a generous portion of the steaming cream stew and slid it into my mouth. The rich, savory flavor spread across my palate, melting smoothly on my tongue.

“Wow… this is really good, isn’t it? It practically melts in your mouth,” An-hyeon exclaimed, making a fuss. 

An-sol, following his lead, cautiously picked up a piece of bread and took a tentative bite. Her eyes widened in surprise, and she began chewing faster. Watching them both dig in with enthusiasm warmed my heart. But one person still hadn’t touched their food.

Yu-jeong wasn’t usually a big eater—except when it came to alcohol—but she wasn’t one to pick at her food either. Yet now, she was listlessly stirring her chopsticks, barely eating. Her eyes were vacant, her gaze unfocused, as if she’d suffered a deep shock. It made sense. Having been the direct target of that intense, malice-filled mana burst at close range, she must have felt something far more overwhelming than the others.

I’d been through something similar before, so I could somewhat understand her state of mind. Humiliation. Shame. Self-loathing. Powerlessness. It’s a filthy feeling only those who’ve experienced it can truly grasp. This time, I’d somewhat orchestrated the situation, so I felt a twinge of guilt. Being outmatched in mana essentially proved that your skill was inferior to your opponent’s.

But this was a necessary process. I believed these experiences would become the blood and flesh that strengthened them. No one could predict how many similar situations they’d face in the future.

We were now full-fledged Users in the vast world of the Hall Plane. It wasn’t just about competing with other new Users; we had to contend with countless veteran Users as well. In that sense, these kids were still mere chicks—newly hatched ones at that.

They didn’t yet know what it meant to be hungry, to act with caution, or to distinguish when to step forward and when to hold back. In short, they lacked a sense of urgency. Part of that was my fault. Ever since the Rite of Passage, I’d kept them sheltered under my wing, letting them roam freely within my protection.

Even if luck had carried us this far, could they survive in the Hall Plane for over a decade with this attitude? I’d say there’s a 99% chance they wouldn’t. Even I, who always acted cautiously and avoided unnecessary risks, had crossed countless life-and-death lines.

This was the Maginot Line, so to speak. User-on-User killing—PK—was the final boundary holding things together. In the Northern Continent, there was still an unspoken reluctance among veteran Users to kill one another. For now, at least. That’s why vagrants were currently shunned by all.

But after the First Coalition War breaks out, the situation will flip 180 degrees. In the late stages, PK becomes indiscriminate, with clear lines drawn between allies and enemies. Yesterday’s foe could become today’s ally, and yesterday’s ally could turn into today’s enemy. Surviving in such a turbulent Hall Plane required resilience.

To that end, I planned to teach the kids survival skills. But first, I needed to sharpen their lax mindsets. That’s why I’d brought them to the Modest Lady inn in Mul, where I believed we could gain much.

After finishing the meal, I rented two double rooms. Counting the remaining gold, including my weekly stipend, I had 6 Gold and 40 Silver (+1000 Gold). The meal and week-long lodging cost 20 Silver, so I paid 40 Silver in total.

I had everyone unpack briefly in their assigned rooms before gathering them in the room An-hyeon and I shared. An-hyeon was fidgeting, clenching and unclenching his fists, his face brimming with eager anticipation, as if he couldn’t wait to venture outside the city. Yu-jeong’s expression remained subdued, and An-sol was quietly observing her sister’s mood.

Oblivious, An-hyeon swung his arms and spoke up. “Hyung, so from now on, the four of us will stick together in Mul, right? Hunt monsters, explore dungeons or caves, find treasures…”

I sighed inwardly. Why did I keep sighing so much since meeting these kids? Staring at the overly excited An-hyeon, I fixed him with a steady gaze. I wasn’t planning to head out immediately, but it was clear An-hyeon needed some serious mental discipline first. Despite my unusual response, he kept talking.

“Then we should start by forming a clan. What should we name it? Honestly, something like Golden Lion sounds so tacky…”

“We can’t make one,” I said.

“Something else—huh? You’re not making one? Why not?”

“I didn’t say we’re not making one. I said we *can’t*.”

I rubbed my temple with one hand and let out an audible sigh. An-hyeon was diligent in combat training, but during lessons on the Hall Plane’s history or systems, he often dozed off. If he’d paid attention, he wouldn’t be suggesting we form a clan now. Finally noticing my expression, he fell silent.

After a brief pause, I spoke in a low voice. “Right now, the four of us don’t meet the conditions to form an official clan.”

“Conditions? I thought you only needed one person to make a clan,” An-hyeon said, confused.

He’d only memorized the easy stuff. I clicked my tongue inwardly and continued, determined to address this now. Later, when they were more seasoned Users, I wouldn’t be so lenient if they made these mistakes.

A clan is simply a group of Users with a shared purpose. But an official clan isn’t something just anyone can create. Residents, guided by the angels’ oracles, manage all clan-related matters at registration offices in each city. The process is fair but strict.

That left us with only one option: accumulate achievements. Major feats that impact the Hall Plane’s main storyline would be ideal, but those were far beyond our reach now. Achievements, unlike feats, cover a broad range. Caravans and expedition teams must submit performance reports after completing missions. These reports are reviewed at the city’s temple, and if deemed significant, the temple may form an inspection team or request a representative clan to verify the facts.

Every detail—monsters encountered, dungeons or caves discovered, exploration details—could contribute to achievements. Once we’d built up enough, we could apply for official clan status, which involves a rigorous review. With countless applications daily but only a handful approved monthly, the process is notoriously tough. That’s why officially recognized clans command respect.

“Hoo…” An-hyeon let out an impressed sound, his face lit with curiosity.

Hoo, my foot. Even An-sol seemed to already know this. Watching him nod as if it all made sense, I stepped forward, drawing their attention. Turning to Yu-jeong, I spoke. “How does it feel to take your first steps in the Hall Plane?”

“Not great,” Yu-jeong replied, her voice heavy.

I nodded once or twice and pressed on. “Frustrated?”

“…Humiliated. And frustrated.”

Her immediate response showed how deeply she’d felt her own powerlessness. Considering her opponent would later grow to rival even me, there was a handicap of sorts. Still, the impact was undeniable, so I spoke with more force. “I’ve always told you: the Hall Plane is full of variables. You never know what might happen or where. If that woman earlier had been a vagrant, what do you think would’ve happened?”

My blunt words left them speechless, but I wasn’t done. “Stay sharp. Too much tension is poison, but in the Hall Plane, you need to stay alert. We’re not here for a picnic or a treasure hunt. We’re here to survive and return to Earth. Got it?”

A heavy silence fell over An-hyeon, An-sol, and Yu-jeong. An-hyeon lowered his head, looking chastened. Yu-jeong and An-sol wore glum expressions.

“Good, you’re frustrated. But don’t feel wronged. That just means you’re weak. If you don’t want to feel this humiliation again, grit your teeth and steel your mind.”

I scanned their faces. They seemed to be grasping their current standing, at least a little. It was time to roll out the first plan to help them grow.

Softening my tone slightly, I continued.
