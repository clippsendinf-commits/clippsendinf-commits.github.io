# Chapter 53: Our Oppa Has Changed

As I approached the vagrant, who was gaping in disbelief, the female mage looked up at me with eyes filled with terror. I lowered my head, meeting her gaze with an impassive stare. She had the classic features of a cat-like beauty, with slightly upturned eyes. Seeing her trembling, a strange sense of déjà vu gripped me.

In my first cycle, I operated mostly in the shadows. Not many knew of me, but those who did once called me the "Vagrant Hunter." Later, the lines between regular users and vagrants blurred, but vagrants were typically associated with negative images—murder, robbery, rape. As their activities grew rampant, an eye for an eye became the rule. Regular users secretly formed a clan dedicated to hunting vagrants. That clan was the very group known as the Vagrant Hunters.

This clan operated with no restraints against vagrants. Enslavement, human experimentation, murder, rape—anything was permitted as long as the target was a vagrant. Their deeds were so vile that even some regular users, aware of their actions, began to shun the hunters. I briefly joined them, and memories of those days surfaced as I stood there. I let the blood-soaked sword, still dripping from the vagrants I’d just dispatched, hang loosely at my side. Despite her fear, this mage seemed to have some skill or intuition, piquing my curiosity about her information.

As I suspected, she was a user of less than a year. Her vagrant career was likely even shorter. For a mage, her stats were decent—above average for her experience level. Compared to Hyeon, Sol, and Yujeong’s exceptional stats, hers might seem modest, but they were still respectable. Had we met during the Rite of Passage, I might have considered recruiting her as a comrade. But now, Lee Bo-mi was part of a group of vagrants who tried to kill us.

“Huahhh…”

Sensing my cold killing intent, Lee Bo-mi let out a feeble scream. Even as she writhed, her fingers twitched, struggling against her bindings. I pressed my foot firmly on her hand and slowly raised my sword. A drop of blood from the blade fell, staining her cheek, and she seemed to realize death was imminent. In a frantic voice, she pleaded, “P-please, spare me!”

I ignored her and turned to the kids, who were watching blankly.

“See? If you put your mind to it, you can do it. This battle was pretty good. Having fought users before definitely made a difference compared to earlier. They were careless, sure, but you all did well.”

“I’ll do whatever you say! Please! We’re both Korean, right? I didn’t want to do this! Please, please…!” Lee Bo-mi’s desperate cries continued.

The kids’ expressions were complex. They seemed pleased by my praise but uneasy watching the woman writhing and screaming beneath my foot. I continued, ignoring her completely. “You can’t just excel in familiar fights. Experience will help, but always stay calm and do your part, like just now. And as I said before, never show mercy to vagrants. If you let them live, they’ll only cause trouble… Oh, she’s getting loud.”

“I’ll give you everything I have! My body, if you want it—or I’ll be your slave…! Gah!” Her incessant pleading grated on me, so I swiftly drove my sword into her slender neck. She let out a final scream, blood gushing from her mouth as she collapsed, lifeless.

“Ah…”

“Huh…!”

As I pulled the sword from her neck and shook off the blood, the kids gasped, their voices tinged with shock. I realized my mistake. My old habits from my Vagrant Hunter days had surfaced. Back in my first cycle in Hall Plane, I killed without hesitation, but that image clashed with the one I’d shown the kids so far. I worried they might feel a disconnect. Glancing at them, I saw their throats bob as they stared at the woman’s limp body.

Dusk had settled. The faint sunlight that had lingered was gone, replaced by an encroaching pitch-black darkness. Estimating our progress, we were still midway through our journey. It wasn’t a distance we could cover in a day or two, so I decided not to rush.

The kids were growing with every battle. They weren’t perfect, but they no longer made the rookie mistakes of the early days. Today, we fought six battles in the Black Forest. Had it not been for the last one, we might have gotten through the day without issue.

“Cure!”

“Ugh…”

I looked at An-hyeon, lying on the ground, groaning. Sol, sweating profusely, was casting a healing spell over him. His body was covered in bite marks from the wolves. A pack of sixteen Black Forest wolves had ambushed us, and nearly half had targeted An-hyeon. I couldn’t fault him—he likely fought desperately to protect Sol, who would’ve been vulnerable if he fell.

Wolves weren’t typically tough opponents, but the Black Forest’s buff gave them exceptional aggression and agility. Despite being torn into, An-hyeon fought valiantly, wielding his spear with my support and tactical coordination, managing to take down most of the eight wolves that attacked him. But by the end, he collapsed, bloodied and exhausted.

I quickly pulled out a healing potion, applying half to his wounds and pouring the rest down his throat. Sol, frantic over his injuries, was casting Cure spells excessively, tears streaming down her face. In Hall Plane, wounds like these were commonplace. With potions and a priestess like Sol, An-hyeon’s life wasn’t in danger.

Once the healing was done, An-hyeon groaned and sat up. Yujeong, who had been watching anxiously, let out a sigh of relief. “Phew… Idiot. You’re lucky.”

“Is that praise or an insult? Pick one.”

“I was worried, okay?”

“Hyung, did the sun set in the east today?”

Yujeong paused, then narrowed her eyes, realizing An-hyeon was teasing her. I shook my head at their bickering. “How’s your body?”

“I think I’m recovering. My joints ache, and I’m weak, but I can move.”

“Then we can’t keep fighting today. It’s getting dark, so we’ll camp here. Good job holding your ground.”

“No way. If you hadn’t backed me up, I’d have been down ages ago.”

He’d noticed my support despite his frenzied spearwork. Wolves weren’t a threat to me, but I’d let An-hyeon take some hits on purpose. Injuries and recovery could boost endurance stats, and I suspected it might help awaken his latent “Unyielding” ability. His struggles now would pay off later.

With six battles done and night falling, I deemed it enough for the day. As I announced we’d camp, Yujeong began bustling about, while An-hyeon stayed put. I took the bag from Sol and rummaged through it, pulling out a magic stone.

Yujeong, clearing leaves and brush from the ground, tilted her head at the stone. “Oppa, so we’re sleeping in this forest?”

“Yeah. Why?”

“Isn’t it a bit dangerous? Monsters could attack at night. Standing watch might not be enough.”

“Hm. The magic stone we’re using for camping should keep things under control.”

Seeing the kids talk to me casually, I felt relieved. They didn’t seem too shaken by me killing Lee Bo-mi. They might be hiding their discomfort, but I’d have been annoyed if they made a fuss about it. Their training at the User Academy about vagrants likely helped avoid any awkward tension.

Yujeong’s expression shifted oddly at the mention of the magic stone. She glanced at her weapon, then at Hyeon and Sol’s, the backpack, the empty potion bottle, and finally the stone, before speaking with a confused look. “Oppa.”

“What now? If it’s not urgent, help with camp.”

“No, it’s not that. Where did you get all this stuff?”

“What?”

She pointed at each item. “Weapons, inn fees, backpack, magic stone, potions, and more. Even with the money we gave you and your weekly pay, it’s barely ten gold. I heard magic stones are crazy expensive.”

“Camping magic stones aren’t that pricey. They repel monsters to some extent. They’re not top quality, so we still need a watch.”

“Still, ten gold doesn’t add up for all this. Did you find money somewhere?”

Hyeon and Sol nodded along, their curious faces demanding an answer. Pretending to level the ground for camp, I held four magic stones and replied nonchalantly, “User Academy.”

“Academy? Did they give you extra for good training scores?”

“No. It came with a clan offer.”

“But you rejected all the clan offers. They gave it to you anyway?”

“Hyung, did you pull a dine-and-dash?”

I sighed as Yujeong and Hyeon pressed me. They flinched, likely recalling my earlier anger. Yujeong looked like she regretted asking, and Hyeon scratched his head, worried he’d misspoken. I clicked my tongue and continued, “They gave it as a gesture, saying to come if I change my mind. It was a gift—no reason to refuse.”

“Ohh…”

What’s with the “ohh”? It was a quick excuse, but not entirely unreasonable, and they seemed to buy it. Lying didn’t sit well with me, but I couldn’t exactly spill my past either, so I kept a straight face.

“Taking it seemed better than making a fuss. It’s not like we’re swimming in gold. If we don’t get results from this expedition, we might not even afford food, let alone an inn.”

“Ugh, that’d suck. So that’s why you told us to check the vagrants’ stuff. I wasn’t thrilled about that.”

Scorpions and wolves in the Black Forest don’t yield valuable loot. Some monsters are profitable, others aren’t. Vagrants thrive because killing users brings far more money than hunting monsters. Conversely, users can profit handsomely from hunting vagrants. If the kids weren’t around, I’d have stripped the vagrants down to their underwear. But with my secret funds and their watchful eyes, I only took what was visible. Old habits from my desperate first cycle still lingered.

“Don’t complain about being full. Gold doesn’t grow on trees. Let’s rest now and push hard tomorrow. Set up camp.”

I made An-hyeon lie back down as he tried to stand, then reached for the backpack. It felt heavier than before, likely from the vagrants’ loot. Pulling out a sleeping bag, I glanced at Yujeong and Sol preparing dinner. Both looked exhausted but showed no signs of shock. They had room to improve, and I’d keep watching, but for now, I felt reassured.
