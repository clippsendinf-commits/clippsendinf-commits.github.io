# Memorize - Chapter 15: Split in Half

The Deadmen were shambling toward us, sniffing the air incessantly. Their skin hung in tattered strips, and decayed bones protruded from their faces, creating a grotesque impression. Fear welled up in the eyes of the others as they watched. These were people who, until just yesterday, had lived ordinary lives. Expecting them to react swiftly to Deadmen in less than a day was a tall order.

*Growl. Growl.*

The Deadman at the front let out a low snarl. Its slow steps suggested it hadn’t fully locked onto us yet. But as I noticed one at the back veer off in another direction, I furrowed my brow. Taking down all three at once was no longer an option.

*Growl. Growl.*

Each snarl from the Deadmen seemed to make the tree we were hiding behind tremble. I glanced over and, sure enough, the culprit was An-sol. She was leaning against the tree, shaking violently.

*Swish, swish.*

The sound of grass being trampled grew louder as two Deadmen reached the tree. They paused, tilting their heads curiously, then resumed their slow advance. The tree we were using for cover was quite wide, so I signaled the group to move quietly. For every step the Deadmen took, we shifted sideways, matching their pace. There was a high chance we’d be spotted if they suddenly turned, but their tendency to move straight ahead gave us a shot at staying hidden.

One step closer. We slide one step over.

One step closer. We slide one step over.

One step closer. We slide one step over.

After three or four repetitions, we had circled more than halfway around the tree, and the Deadmen had reached the spot where we’d been moments before. The air around us was deathly quiet as we held our breaths. The Deadmen, scanning the area with jerky head movements, let out frustrated growls before continuing forward. Relief began to creep onto everyone’s faces as we realized we just needed to hold out a little longer.

*Snap! Crack!*

“Eek!”

An-sol, trembling with her eyes squeezed shut, accidentally stepped on a twig, snapping it. I looked down to see the broken branch under her foot. To make matters worse, she let out a yelp loud enough for the Deadmen to hear. The situation had just gone south.

*Growl! Growl! Growl!*

The Deadmen’s snarls grew more frequent. The group froze, unable to move. The creatures’ steps quickened, and one of them poked its hideous face around the tree’s edge. We were caught.

“Raaaagh!”

“Eek! Eeeeek!”

A Deadman charged, its blood-red teeth bared in a gaping maw. An-sol screamed again, though An-hyeon’s hand over her mouth muffled the sound somewhat. It was still loud enough for the three nearby Deadmen to hear. In that critical moment, I aimed my crossbow while An-hyeon raised his shield with his free hand, protecting himself and An-sol. The charging Deadman collided with the shield with a loud *thud*.

The impact made An-hyeon stagger, but he successfully blocked the attack. The Deadman, however, only retreated a single step. An-hyeon’s focus was split, protecting An-sol with his right hand. As another Deadman rushed in, I prepared to fire my crossbow. A sudden thought flashed through my mind, and instead of aiming for the head, I lowered the crossbow slightly and let the bolt fly.

*One or two shots won’t be enough.*

With a *ping*, the bolt pierced the second Deadman’s chest. As it stumbled, I swiftly drew the longsword from my waist.

“An-hyeon! Send your sister over here! Take this sword!”

An-hyeon gritted his teeth as another Deadman barreled toward him. He shoved An-sol toward me and reached out with his right hand.

“Take care of her!”

As he spoke, the Deadmen slammed into his shield again, forcing him back several steps. Somehow, he managed to push An-sol toward me. She stumbled into my arms, and I tossed the sword in a way that An-hyeon could easily catch. The sword and An-sol crossed paths midair. As I caught her safely, I heard the urgent shouts of Yu-jeong and Han-byeol behind me.

“Oppa, behind you!”

“Look out behind!”

*I know.*

Glancing back, I saw the third Deadman, the one that had veered off earlier, charging toward me. To an ordinary person, it might have been a split-second moment, but my senses were beyond that. In two seconds, I reloaded the crossbow, aimed at its forehead, and fired.

*Thwack!*

This time, I aimed true, and the bolt buried itself in the Deadman’s head. It collapsed instantly.

“Hic… sob… sob…”

From a distance, I’d brushed off An-sol’s frantic behavior, but holding her now, I saw tears streaming down her face as she sobbed pitifully. Without thinking, I patted her head and whispered, “It’s okay,” feeling her trembling ease slightly.

An-hyeon, now armed with sword and shield, had eyes full of fear. Yet he didn’t back down. His legs were planted firmly, facing the threat head-on. This was exactly the attitude I’d hoped to see from him and the others. It was the start of his mental awakening.

He raised his shield to chest height—a smart move, as the best defense is a good offense. Instead of swinging his sword first, he charged at the Deadmen, slamming into them with his shield.

*Thud! Crunch!*

The impact was powerful, and I heard something break. The Deadman’s chest caved in under the force of An-hyeon’s full-strength charge. As he raised his sword for a follow-up strike, I called out a piece of advice.

“Aim for the head. It’s their weak point.”

An-hyeon, about to swing wildly, adjusted his aim at my words and brought the sword down on the Deadman’s head. His form was sloppy, but the force was solid. The creature’s skull split open without resistance.

The second Deadman met a similar fate. An-hyeon used the same tactic: block or stun with the shield, then strike the head while it was disoriented. With a *crunch*, the sword pierced the Deadman’s skull, and it twitched a few times before collapsing, dragging An-hyeon’s arm down with its weight. He quickly yanked the sword free and turned to me, his face dazed.

Harsh breathing filled the air. The tension had been so high that everyone exhaled in relief once the Deadmen were down. An-hyeon’s actions—block with the shield, strike with the sword—were simple but not something just anyone could do. If the Deadmen had targeted someone else, like An-sol, who froze in fear, or even the others, executing clean consecutive attacks would have been difficult.

An-hyeon let his arms hang, panting heavily.

“Huff… huff… It didn’t feel this tough when I was hitting them with rocks from above.”

Of course. In a life-or-death situation, staying calm and controlling your body is no small feat. I felt a small squirm in my arms and loosened my hold on An-sol. She darted to An-hyeon, checking him over.

“Oppa… are you okay?”

“No bites. I’m fine, I think.”

“Sob… sob… I’m sorry…”

“Don’t cry. Stop.”

Realizing her mistake had put her brother in danger, An-sol’s tears fell harder. An-hyeon reassured her he was fine, but her crying didn’t stop. Yu-jeong, looking like she’d aged a decade, trudged over and clapped An-hyeon on the back.

“Thanks to you, we’re alive. Not bad!”

“Nah, if Su-hyeon hyung hadn’t given me this sword, I’d have been in trouble. Here, hyung, take it back.”

I shook my head as he reluctantly offered the sword back. His face lit up.

“I think you should keep the sword.”

“Really? Is that okay?”

“Yeah, Oppa’s got the crossbow anyway. What, did you do kendo or something?”

Yu-jeong chimed in, and An-hyeon sheathed the sword, bowing to me. I smiled inwardly as he and Yu-jeong started chattering. Earlier, I’d aimed for the Deadman’s head but deliberately shot its chest instead.

*He’s not bad…*

“Wait a second.”

Han-byeol, who had successfully stunned a Deadman with a thrown rock, spoke up with a nervous expression. She rarely spoke, so I was curious about what she’d say.

“Back at the clearing… didn’t they swarm us after we killed one?”

“Uh… did they?”

Yu-jeong’s hesitant agreement shifted everyone’s expressions. An-sol looked on the verge of a breakdown. Sensing her panic, An-hyeon patted her back and spoke urgently.

“Then we should get out of here fast, right?”

“Yeah, let’s do it. How about heading the opposite way they came from?”

“No, let’s keep going in our original direction. If we turn back now, we might end up spending the night in this forest.”

Impressively, An-hyeon was determined to escape the forest by nightfall. If we were mentor and apprentice, I might’ve ruffled his hair, but for now, I just nodded in agreement. Though I sensed more Deadmen ahead, his decision was the right one.

After a brief moment to regroup, we quickly left the area behind.
