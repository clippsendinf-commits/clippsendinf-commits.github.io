# Memorize - Chapter 52 (52/1068): My Oppa Has Changed

“oppa. I’m sorry.”  
“Oppa. I’m really sorry…”  

While trudging through the forest, I heard the kids muttering softly behind me. My face twitched as I walked at the front. I couldn’t see my own expression, but I knew it wasn’t a pleasant one.  

“Hoo…”  

The kids flinched at my sigh, laced with regret—a sound they’d never heard from me before. I turned my head toward them as they caught up to my side. After taking a moment to steady my breath, I spoke, keeping my pace steady.  

“The fight with the scorpions has given me a lot to think about. It wasn’t even three or four of them—just one or two, and you struggled. It makes me wonder if the way I’ve been handling you all might be wrong.”  

“O-oppa, that’s not—”  

“I’m talking right now.”  

My low, sharp tone cut Yu-jeong off, and she quickly shut her mouth. Her eyes trembled, looking like she might cry if I pressed her further. But since I’d decided we wouldn’t return to the city until we achieved results, I needed to steel my heart.  

“I’ve always tried to make the best decisions in every situation. I turned down countless clan offers and chose you all because I was confident in my judgment. But now, for the first time, I’m doubting myself. I believed the path I wanted for us would benefit you too, but maybe that was just my arrogance.”  

My tone carried an unfamiliar gravity. After signaling them not to interrupt, the kids listened in silence. An-hyeon focused on my words with a serious expression, while Yu-jeong and Sol exchanged glances, their faces heavy with worry as they looked down.  

“I cared for you all too much. Yu-jeong, when you said ‘we’ before leaving the city, I didn’t show it, but I was thrilled. But I never imagined that care would come back like a boomerang. Or maybe I knew and ignored it. Sure, I’m partly to blame for sticking to this approach, but your attitudes are also a problem. The issues I worried about since the Rite of Passage are starting to show.”  

An-hyeon bit his lip, his face darkening as he listened. They couldn’t argue—they knew exactly what I meant. Breaking formation and putting Sol in danger, stopping a spell because of a tail swipe, standing around watching while a teammate fought, fighting recklessly without considering energy allocation—the list went on.  

I stopped walking and turned to face them. Yu-jeong and Sol looked on the verge of tears. I decided to wrap it up here, because…  

“Honestly, part of me wants to head back to the city right now, form at least a minimal caravan, and start over. But another part of me still wants to believe in you. Is that okay? Can you promise not to disappoint me again?”  

An-hyeon’s face froze, speechless, but I could see a flicker of frustration in his eyes, like he was clenching his teeth inwardly. He was different from the other two. I didn’t want apologies—I wanted them to feel anger, to question why they had no choice but to act the way they did.  

I continued in a firm voice.  

“From now on, we’re changing the Keeper formation. We’ll form a triangular formation with Sol at the center. I’ll take the lead, and An-hyeon and Yu-jeong, you’ll each take a side.”  

“…”  

An-hyeon moved to Sol’s side with a solemn expression, gripping his spear tightly, as if resolving himself. Yu-jeong glanced at me warily before moving to the other side. Sol looked uneasy at the mention of changing the Keeper formation, but I spoke firmly, my face impassive.  

“I’ll explain this once, so listen carefully. The triangular formation doesn’t mean there’s no Keeper. If anything, every member of the formation *is* a Keeper.”  

“You mean the formation must never break,” An-hyeon said.  

I tilted my head slightly, looking ahead. I heard something moving slowly. After scanning the front carefully, I gave An-hyeon a subtle glance. He caught my signal and quietly adjusted his spear’s direction. I started walking again, slowly.  

“Exactly. Don’t just use detection for evasion. Focus on reading the enemy’s attack patterns, countering, and finding openings. If this formation collapses, Sol collapses too. Hold the formation like your life depends on it. We form this to support each other and coordinate, not to act like lone wolves.”  

“Understood,” An-hyeon replied.  

“One more thing. I’m not standing at the front just to guide the way. There’s another reason. Can you guess what it is?”  

“Hmm…”  

An-hyeon’s response was slightly off, and I saw Yu-jeong and Sol tilt their heads in confusion. We were moving at less than half our original speed now. I glanced at the trees and a large boulder we were passing, gripping my sword tightly.  

“It’s for situations… like *this*!”  

I infused my sword with mana and slashed at the boulder we were about to pass. It split open, and a spray of red blood gushed out. The figure hiding there, likely an assassin, had evaded the kids’ detection, but not my eyes.  

“Damn it! Jong-min!”  

“Crazy!”  

After cutting down one of them, three figures landed around us in an instant—two men and a woman. Their ragged appearance marked them as vagrants, clearly planning an ambush. But since I’d struck first and taken one out, they revealed themselves, realizing their cover was blown.  

Yu-jeong and Sol looked startled again, but An-hyeon remained relatively calm, thanks to my earlier hint. Though surprised to face other humans, they saw the vagrants’ killing intent and quickly drew their weapons.  

“You bastard! You killed Jong-min!”  

“They said they were new users! How did he spot the stealth?”  

“Calm down. We underestimated them. You there—how did you know he was hiding in the boulder?”  

The female user addressed me, but I didn’t respond. After analyzing the shouting vagrants, I quickly relayed the information to the kids.  

“These are what we call vagrants. Do exactly as you learned at the Academy. Don’t talk to them, and treat them like monsters. The moment you think of them as fellow users, you’ll hesitate. Kill them without mercy. One shield warrior, one axe warrior, one mage. We outnumber them, and our class composition gives us the advantage. Sol, what are you doing? The fight’s already started. Got a sense of who to target?”  

“What…? Just a bunch of fresh newbies! Let’s crush them!”  

“Wait a second…!”  

The axe warrior, ignoring my words, charged forward with his weapon raised. The shield warrior followed, raising his shield high. The female mage seemed to try stopping them but, realizing it was too late, gritted her teeth and began casting a spell quickly.  

I looked at them with pity. They were clearly new to the Hall Plane and to being vagrants, just like us. If the shield warrior had disrupted our formation first, followed by the axe warrior’s attack, it might have been a decent strategy. But they were charging in as chaotically as we had been, likely underestimating us as new users.  

Then, I saw the two charging users close their eyes slightly. I immediately shouted to the kids.  

“It’s Light magic! Close your eyes!”  

At the same moment, the female mage extended a glowing hand toward us and called out in a thin voice.  

“Light!”  

As a basic spell, she completed it faster than Sol. A sphere of light formed in front of us and burst with a flash, likely meant to disrupt our vision. The problem was, we had already trained in detection.  

I glanced to the side and saw Yu-jeong and An-hyeon, eyes closed, taking defensive stances. Sol, too, was gritting her teeth and chanting a spell. Yes—this was exactly what I wanted to see.  

Taking a moment to check on the kids, I turned a cold gaze toward the vagrants. Despite being hit by the Light spell, I stared straight at the axe warrior, who slowed his charge, looking flustered. The shield warrior, not noticing, veered left, likely targeting Yu-jeong.  

These guys were, frankly, pathetic. The hidden assassin and the female mage had some skill, but the two charging in were hopeless.  

As I raised my sword to strike, a long spear thrust out from my side. The axe warrior, not expecting an attack from the side after the Light spell, twisted his body in panic. An-hyeon, eyes still closed, had perfectly timed his thrust to disrupt the warrior’s path.  

“No way…! How do newbies know detection…?”  

“They do.”  

As the warrior exposed his stomach while dodging the spear, I answered curtly and thrust my sword. The blade tore through his leather armor, the sensation of ripping flesh traveling through my grip. Their strategy of combining Light with an attack wasn’t bad, but their carelessness was their downfall. As the warrior spat blood with a hollow expression, I turned my head.  

*Clang! Clang!*  

The harsh sound of metal scraping echoed around us. Yu-jeong had raised her dagger vertically, steadily retreating to block the shield warrior’s charge. The warrior, stunned that his attack was blocked, stammered.  

“N-no way… My strength is clearly…”  

Indeed, the shield warrior had higher physical strength. As their weapons clashed, Yu-jeong was slowly pushed back. But he had overlooked her mana stat. Her eyes snapped open, and with a surge of mana, she let out a fierce cry.  

“Yah!”  

She compensated for her lacking strength with mana, a technique she’d learned at the User Academy. Her dagger hummed with enhanced cutting power and durability, emitting a low resonance. The warrior tried to attack with his other hand’s sword, but another spear shot through the gap between me and Sol.  

I twisted my sword, pulled it out, and swung again, severing the axe warrior’s neck. An-hyeon’s spear sliced through the air and pierced the shield warrior’s exposed side.  

The shield warrior stared at the axe warrior’s head on the ground and the spear in his side, then dropped his shield with a look of disbelief. Seeing his front open, Yu-jeong hesitated briefly but bit her lip and drove both daggers into his body.  

“Urk!”  

I didn’t know where they’d heard we were new users, but these guys were barely any different. They’d probably been in the Hall Plane for six months, maybe a year at most. I didn’t know how they became vagrants, but they were a clear example of those who couldn’t adapt—lacking skill, training, and effort, leading to a pitiful end.  

Yu-jeong, seeing the warrior collapse, took on a grim, determined expression, perhaps because she knew I was watching. Her hands, gripping the daggers in his chest, trembled visibly.  

But there was no time to rest. The female mage was still there, likely preparing a bigger spell since she’d gone quiet. Unfortunately for her, Sol had already finished her own. Raising her glowing staff, Sol, sweating heavily, shouted the activation word without hesitation.  

“Shackles!”  

A brilliant light filled the forest, and the mage scoffed, continuing her chant while forming a hand sign with one hand. My eyes glinted—this was double casting, chanting a spell while forming a mana resistance sign to avoid interruption. It required significant focus and marked her as a skilled user.  

But she had overlooked one thing: Sol’s mana stat.  

“W-what…? No way! My mana stat is over 60!”  

Her hand, forming the sign, trembled, and she screamed, abandoning her spell to focus on resisting Sol’s magic. It was a quick decision, but she couldn’t match Sol, who started with a mana stat of 75.  

Though she resisted briefly, Sol’s Shackles spell clung tenaciously. I stopped An-hyeon and Yu-jeong from rushing in, as Sol was still channeling mana into the spell. I wanted her to experience her first mana-based combat.  

Soon, the female user collapsed. Unable to withstand Sol’s mana, she lay rigid, mouth agape, with a vacant expression.
