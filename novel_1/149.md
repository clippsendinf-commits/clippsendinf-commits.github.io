# Chapter 148: The Cave of Screams (1)

As I raised my head, I saw the sun, tinged with the hues of a fading sunset. I paused for a moment, taking in the lush undergrowth and dense trees around me. Perhaps due to a recent rain, the blades of grass along the path were adorned with tiny, round droplets of water, glistening like beads. These dewdrops, reflecting the sunset’s light, enveloped the entire meadow. It was a breathtakingly beautiful scene.

Strictly speaking, the path heading east from Mul wasn’t entirely uncharted, though it felt somewhat ambiguous to call it fully explored. To the west lay the Black Forest, and to the north stretched a wasteland. The path we were walking, however, straddled the line between a route connecting the eastern cities and an area that could be classified as uncharted. While users didn’t frequently travel this way, it wasn’t completely untouched by explorers either.

“Hyung, are we almost there?” An-hyeon asked, his curiosity piqued as I stood still.

I shook my head and pointed toward the horizon that stretched endlessly before us. “Not yet. We just need to cross this meadow. Once we do, the Blue Mountains will come into view. That’s our destination.”

“The Blue Mountains?” he asked.

“They’re called that because, from a distance, the mountains shimmer with a bluish hue. That’s how they’re marked on the map too. And while it’s not set in stone, I’ve heard they serve as the boundary between the uncharted regions of the small city of Mul and the northeastern city of Eden.”

An-hyeon nodded once or twice, seeming to accept my explanation without fully grasping it, and fell silent.

It looked like we were on the right track. I had been a bit anxious since the Cave of Screams was a place I’d explored long ago, but this meadow was unmistakable. I clearly remembered which entrance to take in the Blue Mountains and which forks to follow. As the first ruin I’d uncovered in my first cycle, the memories were still vivid.

The party trailing behind me was quiet. After a fierce battle with fourteen Stone Magoils, everyone looked worse for wear. The exhaustion was palpable, and though they clearly wanted to rest, I decided to press on. Once we crossed this meadow, the Blue Mountains would be right ahead. The Cave of Screams wouldn’t take long to conquer, and the faster we moved now, the sooner we’d return to Mul.

With my resolve set, I spoke quietly without looking back. “It’s about time to set up camp, but we’ll keep marching. I’m planning an all-night march as well, so everyone, prepare yourselves. We’ll take a twenty-minute break here. If you have anything to sort out, do it now.”

Surprisingly, not a single person complained, following my orders without protest. Even the kids, after exchanging subtle glances, sat down on the damp ground without hesitation.

While the kids hadn’t grown much physically, their mental growth had been limited too. But this expedition—more precisely, the battle with the Radolfs—marked a turning point. They were starting to change. In the past, I’d handled most of the fighting, but in recent battles, I’d delegated at least a fair share to each of them. At first, they seemed awkward, but once they realized their current strength could hold its own against monsters, it sparked new thoughts. They were no longer mere novice users.

Add to that a subtle sense of rivalry among them. If they continued to grow like this, by the time we left Mul, they’d be far more capable users. The thought brought a faint smile to my lips. I sat down, pulled a cigarette from my pocket, and lit it. Jeong Ha-yeon occasionally nagged me about quitting, saying it was bad for my health, but that was non-negotiable.

*Chik. Chiiiiik.*

“Hoo.”

Despite my mention of a night march, the caravan buzzed with activity. Some might call moving at night reckless, but in an open meadow like this, it made little difference. Besides, the frequency of monster encounters was increasing, so camping now wouldn’t guarantee a peaceful morning.

Just yesterday at dawn, we’d been ambushed by monsters while sleeping in the mountains. They were only Mountain Goblins, and the three mages’ carefully set alarm and trap spells obliterated them, but the fact remained: we’d been attacked. (As an aside, An-sol and Vivian, who were on watch, had been cozily dozing off together.)

In a wide-open meadow, terrain-based defensive spells like those used in the mountains lost much of their effectiveness. Goblins might be manageable, but a swarm of Magoils or charging Radolfs could put us in serious trouble. To reach our destination quickly and avoid unnecessary complications, I’d opted for a night march.

As I finished my cigarette, I sensed someone cautiously approaching from behind. Soon, I heard the soft rustle of grass being stepped on, followed by the slight weight of someone leaning against my back. The user—or rather, resident—rested their neck against my shoulder and spoke in a drowsy voice.

“Kim Su-hyeon, I have a question.”

“Ask away.”

“Really? Thanks. Here goes.”

“No need to thank—hey! Bite my shoulder, and you’re dead.”

Vivian, who had opened her mouth to nip at my shoulder, snapped it shut with a clack at my warning. I flicked her forehead lightly, and she twisted her body as if begging for more. I instantly regretted it.

After some playful banter, Vivian finally spoke in a serious tone. “My bag was really heavy.”

“…”

“When I checked, it was stuffed with equipment I’d never seen before.”

I glanced at the kids. An-hyeon was massaging his legs, Yu-jeong was tossing and catching Skrep, and An-sol was fussing over her feet beside An-hyeon. After observing them, I replied in a low voice, “We had some tails.”

“When? Where? And what did you do?”

“Three days ago, while we were sleeping in the mountains. I took care of them.”

“Hmm. I had no idea. Why’d you stuff it all in *my* bag?”

“I didn’t want the kids to know.”

“Oh? Protecting them?”

“No.”

I firmly denied it. My words carried a different meaning. The kids were in the midst of mental growth, finding their footing. I didn’t want to introduce unnecessary variables. They weren’t strangers to killing, but someone like An-sol might waver if exposed to this. I flicked the spent cigarette away and continued, “They’re doing well right now. I don’t want to throw in new complications. They’re still unpredictable, and it’s only been two months since they truly entered the Hall Plane. They’ve had a taste before, so monsters are enough for now. Too much would overwhelm them. And above all…”

Vivian tilted her head, not fully understanding. I didn’t mind; I was half-talking to myself anyway. The twenty-minute break was nearly over. I pushed Vivian off my back, stood up, and said, “Anyway… they’ll get their fill of killing soon enough. Users, vagrants—it’s coming.”

As if to prove my worries were unfounded, our night march went undisturbed. Today marked the tenth day, and since I’d made bold promises to Go Yeon-ju, I maintained a brisk pace. As a result, we successfully crossed the targeted meadow.

When I spotted the towering blue peaks in the distance, I let out a quiet sigh of relief. The majestic mountains ahead shimmered with a beautiful blue hue, as if submerged in the middle of an ocean. Having seen them before, I was unfazed, but the kids, seeing them for the first time, were momentarily captivated before hurriedly catching up to me.

The party had fallen silent, clearly exhausted from the forced march. Even Jeong Ha-yeon’s face was etched with fatigue. Entering the Cave of Screams in this state would be suicidal, so I decided to set up camp for a proper rest. But first, we needed to reach the mountains.

After about forty minutes of trudging, we finally neared the mountain range. I slowed our pace, and when the sea of trees seemed within arm’s reach, I stopped.

We’d marched through the night, and now the sun was peeking through the clouds. I looked up at the sky, nodded a few times, and spoke. “Good work, everyone. The mountains you see ahead are the Blue Mountains. I’d love to head straight in, but some of us are clearly exhausted, so we’ll rest here. Feel free to eat or sleep. And… User Go Yeon-ju, User Jeong Ha-yeon.”

As soon as I finished, I heard the sound of bodies collapsing around me. Of the two users I called, one approached with a graceful sway, while the other shuffled over wearily. I pulled out a map and spoke calmly to them. “I’m going to scout the area briefly to find the right entrance for our route. In the meantime, User Go Yeon-ju, please oversee meal preparations, and User Jeong Ha-yeon, please handle camp setup.”

“I’ll come with you,” one said.

“Going alone? Isn’t that dangerous?” said the other.

“No, I’ll be fine on my own,” I replied, addressing both concerns with one answer.

Ignoring their pouting and worried glances, I set off. If I could find the entrance, the Cave of Screams was as good as discovered. I still remembered the paths that followed. Stepping through the tall grass, I moved forward.

---

Finding the entrance was easy. It wasn’t exactly the same as before, but I recalled that the entrance was marked by massive trees forming a twisted triangle, with bushes spread out in a U-shape on either side. It was a distinctive landmark. The caravan leader back then had sensed something significant and charged in, leading us to the cave. That leader, unfortunately, was killed in a single blow by *that thing* inside, but that’s beside the point.

By piecing together memories of the direction we’d come from, the bushes, and the trees, finding the entrance wasn’t difficult. I didn’t even need to use my Third Eye.

When I returned, most of the party was fast asleep. Remarkably, Shin Sang-yong was keeping watch alone. I could tell he’d volunteered because no one else wanted to. He was shaking his head, fighting to stay awake as his eyes drooped.

I approached quickly, placing a hand on his shoulder. “Go get some rest.”

“Oh, Leader, you’re back… Haha, no, I’m fine. You must be twice as tired leading the caravan. I’ll keep watch since I said I would. Also, we planned for two people, but User Go Yeon-ju assured us the area is safe, so…”

His words warmed my heart. I gently pushed him toward the camp, speaking in a cheerful tone. “It’s morning, so one person on watch is fine with clear visibility. Let’s call it a shift change. You did well during the night march.”

“B-but…”

Shin Sang-yong protested, but only after I showed a hint of frustration did he finally crawl into his sleeping bag. He bowed deeply and pointed to the food Go Yeon-ju had prepared. I told him I’d eat later and surveyed the surroundings.

We were truly on the verge of entering the Cave of Screams.
