# Memorize - Chapter 131: Growing One Step Further

“Brother, brother. Back at that inn… where was it? Oh, right, the Modest Lady inn in Mul. When I was still a Year-0 User, you gave me a dagger, didn’t you?”

“Oh, when you sulked all by yourself?”

“Ugh… don’t point it out like that. It’s so embarrassing. Anyway, I think that’s when I started to change.”

“Really? How so?”

“I didn’t realize it at the time… who would’ve thought I’d end up like this? A blood-soaked crazy woman, of all things… Ah, wait, let me finish—oh!”

“Oh-ho. Your voice sounds especially sultry today. To think the infamous Mercenary Lord of the Northern Continent would let out such a provocative moan. The male mercenaries who see you as a symbol of terror would faint if they heard this.”

“Agh, stop it! I only act like this with you, not with anyone else… ugh, you know that, right? Only you… oh, I’m yours…!”

“Tch.”

“Brother, seriously… what’s gotten into you today!”

“You like it, don’t you?”

“I-I do, but—ah! Wait, hold on!”

Whether it’s a small caravan or a large clan, everyone is cautious when accepting new members. This is especially true in the Hall Plane, where lives are at stake. Considering this, recruiting Go Yeon-ju, even temporarily, was arguably the best decision possible.

Without anyone asking, she was doing more than double her share of work. She set up training areas for the kids and took charge of preparing meals for the group. That wasn’t all. By the time I woke up each morning, a steaming cup of fragrant tea would be waiting on my worktable, alongside neatly organized documents written in sharp, refined handwriting that detailed the current state of affairs in the Hall Plane. In short, Go Yeon-ju made me feel like I was truly running a clan.

However, her kindness wasn’t entirely without complications. After we confirmed each other’s intentions that night, it was clear she was trying to prove herself to me. That meant I had to respond in kind. Simply “working hard” wouldn’t cut it with her. Effort without results would be a miserable failure. I had an obligation to show results that matched her dedication, and the first step toward that was the Cave of Screams.

Even so, I made a point to study the records more closely. Not just for the Cave of Screams, but also to consider expeditions that might not have been discovered in my first cycle. The odds of that were now less like picking a star from the sky and more like catching an asteroid, but I kept the possibility in mind just in case.

External achievements aside, the internal state of the clan was even more critical. How were our finances? How were the relationships among the members? What was everyone working on? From her behavior, it seemed Go Yeon-ju had been part of a clan before, and now that she was here, she’d be observing and judging everything.

An-hyeon was following the textbook path of an elite. His slightly lacking magic power from his regular class days had been partially compensated for by becoming a Ki-Gong Spearmaster. I’d worried he might get distracted by Go Yeon-ju, but seeing him restrain himself and train diligently during practice sessions warmed my heart.

An-sol and Ha-yeon were also sticking to their daily routines faithfully. Ha-yeon didn’t need much guidance from me, but it was remarkable that An-sol was keeping up with her schedule. (Though she did whine every time she saw me.) Given their different classes, expecting a diversification of divine spells was unrealistic, but improving mana control alone would be a significant achievement. With An-sol’s high stats, even just using binding, healing, and protection spells would be a substantial help.

Vivian and Shin Sang-yong were also showing great effort. Especially Vivian, who had become noticeably busier since Go Yeon-ju joined. She was deciphering records for An-hyeon, teaching Shin Sang-yong, and significantly increasing her own training time. It seemed seeing Go Yeon-ju had sparked some competitive spirit in her.

Shin Sang-yong was quietly working harder than anyone behind the scenes. His reserved nature meant he didn’t stand out, but he was always the first to volunteer for less desirable tasks. Users like him were the hidden strength of a clan. That’s why I always greeted him with a warm smile.

Things seemed to be going well overall, but a closer look revealed some issues. The biggest problem was Yu-jeong. Despite the group’s generally positive momentum, an awkward atmosphere occasionally surfaced, and Yu-jeong was at the center of it.

She used to be the lively spark of the group, always jumping into conversations like a pinch of ginseng. But lately, she’d been visibly downcast, often retreating to be alone. I’d been advised by the others to let her be for now, but it was hard to watch without feeling frustrated.

In my first cycle, I might’ve dismissed her outright. During the Rite of Passage, I would’ve called her pathetic. Even now, part of me felt that way, but I also felt a stronger sense of pity. It wasn’t just attachment from our time together or knowing how much she looked up to me and cared for me. I could empathize with what she was feeling inside.

The signs had been there since An-hyeon obtained a rare class. Our clan aimed to be among the top 1% of Users, so we kept recruiting highly skilled individuals. To make matters worse, An-hyeon, whom she saw as a rival, had inherited a class. Yu-jeong was now grappling with feelings of inferiority and stagnation.

Could she keep up? Even if she tried, would she ever catch up?

Strictly speaking, Yu-jeong’s contributions since our expeditions had been minimal compared to the others. But that was to be expected. I admit I favored An-hyeon, wanting to nurture his superior skills and giving him more opportunities. But Yu-jeong was different. Her class and weapon meant that every battle was a life-or-death gamble.

My attempts to protect her had backfired like a poisoned boomerang. There were two ways to break through her current situation: find her a rare class like An-hyeon’s or help her accept her circumstances and push forward through self-realization. The former was unrealistic, and Go Yeon-ju advised waiting for her to come to terms with it herself.

To Go Yeon-ju, Yu-jeong’s behavior probably seemed laughable. Despite her own Secret Class and high stats, Go Yeon-ju had likely endured grueling effort to reach the ranks of the Ten Strongest. She probably saw Yu-jeong’s struggles as childish in comparison.

But my perspective was different. Yu-jeong might seem tough and rough on the outside, but she had a fragile inner self. Even the most correct advice didn’t apply universally to everyone.

Those at the bottom have their own unique emotions. Yu-jeong was facing the same dilemmas I’d wrestled with endlessly in my first cycle. The harder it gets, the more one should strive, but the human heart isn’t that simple. So, I believed my judgment was the right one for now.

I closed my eyes and recalled her words one by one.

“Brother… Su-hyeon, is that really you? You’re not someone else, right?”

“The money Hyuni, Soli, and I saved up from our weekly allowances… it’s probably around 7 gold and 80 silver.”

“Not ‘you guys,’ but ‘us.’”

“Brother, you sacrificed for us, but you never deceived us. Even if you did, it wouldn’t count as deception. You must’ve had your reasons.”

“While we were comfortably training or resting, who was running around without a break? It was you, Su-hyeon.”

I sighed and rubbed my forehead. There was some conflict in my mind, but I decided to embrace Yu-jeong once more.

This time, though, I would set clear boundaries.

Late at night, I couldn’t sleep early again. I’d been mulling over the kids’ equipment, which left me with a lot on my mind. Last time, I forgot to bring extra gold coins, but I realized we’d need more funds to get proper gear. Since we still had some GP to spare, using the extra money to shop for equipment didn’t seem like a bad idea.

I sipped warm tea and tapped the table lightly. Suddenly, I recalled something Go Yeon-ju had said as she left.

“Ha? I was joking, but you actually thought that?”

“No… that’s not what I meant. Haha.”

“Oh my, unbelievable. User Kim Su-hyeon? Don’t even dream of drinking the tea I brew starting tomorrow. Honestly, how absurd.”

I picked up the tea she’d brought and activated my Third Eye. It wasn’t intentional; it was a habit from my first cycle. Go Yeon-ju saw me inspecting the cup and laughed, asking if I thought she’d poisoned it. When I flinched at her words, she narrowed her eyes and glared at me fiercely.

After issuing her mock threat, she slammed the door and left. But I knew that by tomorrow morning, there’d be another steaming cup of tea and a report on my table. I chuckled at her protest and took another sip. The refreshing taste suggested she’d added herbs good for fatigue recovery.

As I was reviewing the kids’ current equipment, a knock came at the door. When I called out to come in, An-hyeon, drenched in sweat, burst through the door.

“Hyung, it’s me, An-hyeon. I’m coming in.”

“Seems like you’re already in, but sure, take a seat.”

I gave a wry smile and pointed to a chair. An-hyeon strode over, carefully propped his spear against the wall, and plopped down. Even from a distance, I could feel the heat radiating off him, evidence of his intense training.

As expected, he’d come with questions. Since he started studying the records in earnest, his visits had become more frequent. I’d planned to finish organizing the equipment list and head down anyway, so I decided to help him now. Seeing him work so hard warmed my heart.

After listening closely to his concerns, I began explaining calmly.

“The Ki-Gong Spearmaster has a unique movement style. It’s not just about all-out attacks. If you look at the overall flow… it’s more about using defense and checks to wear down your opponent, then landing a counter. That’s why the Ki-Gong Spearmaster is a defense-focused class.”

“I think you’re right, hyung. Reading the records, it’s totally different from what I expected. I thought ‘Ki-Gong’ meant a flashy, aggressive class, but why is there so much about defense?”

I smiled at his grumbling and continued.

“Ki-Gong is about dramatically improving the efficiency of internal mana manipulation and channeling it into physical techniques. Mastering spear-based defensive techniques is far from a bad thing. These kinds of spear arts always create openings. If you can seize those opportunities, you could even take down a User one or two levels stronger than you, depending on compatibility. You might aim even higher if the matchup is right. And it’s not like you don’t have any heavy-hitting moves, right?”

“Hmm… hyung, I’m sorry, but I’m still not getting it. Could you explain it a bit more?”

Why not? I nodded at An-hyeon’s request, organizing my thoughts. After finishing the last sip of tea, I dove into a more detailed explanation.

“Based on the records, the Ki-Gong Spearmaster’s combat style is highly logical. That means you need to pick up on a lot of details before engaging in battle. First, you scout: how far is the opponent? What class do they have? While exchanging blows, which stats are they specializing in? What weapon are they using, and how are they wielding it? That’s not all—you also need sharp instincts to always execute the optimal technique for the moment. No one knows when or what situation will arise. It’s entirely up to you to piece together the right response in any given scenario.”

“Ughhh, this is so hard.”

“Haha, did you think a rare class would be easy?”

An-hyeon clutched his head and groaned at my explanation. I gave a faint smile, and he let out a deep sigh, picking up his records and spear. His slumped shoulders showed how tough this was for him. When he first got the rare class, he probably imagined a rosy future, but reality was far from forgiving.

The reason I didn’t choose a Secret Class in the magic talent category, despite having stats in the high 90s, was similar. I’d already reached the pinnacle as a swordsman—a Sword Master—and brought that experience with me. I chose to deepen a path I’d already walked rather than venture into uncharted territory. It was the safer bet.

For An-hyeon to fully master the Ki-Gong Spearmaster’s power was still a distant goal. As he gave a weary bow and turned to leave, he suddenly spun back with a startled expression.

“Oh, right… hyung, I have something to tell you.”

“Hm? What is it?”

When I responded immediately, An-hyeon hesitated briefly, his face showing a moment of doubt. But he quickly steeled himself and spoke.

“It’s about Yu-jeong.”
