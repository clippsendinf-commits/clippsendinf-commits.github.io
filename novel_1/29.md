# Memorize - Chapter 28 (28/1068)

# A Meeting with Familiar Faces

“I did see a woman on my way here. However, I can’t be certain that the woman we saw is the one your group is talking about.”

My words were chosen carefully, meant to soften the blow. Yet the woman’s eyes still held a glint of conviction. She nodded quickly and responded, “That’s fine. Right now, I’m desperate enough to grasp at straws. If it’s not the long, straight hair, then a yellow dress would almost certainly confirm it.”

“Even if it was a yellow dress… it was torn to pieces, so we could only make out parts of it.”

“What… did you say?”

At my words, the woman faltered, her voice trembling. Woo Jeong-min, Seon Yu-un, and Cheon Seung-hyeon clenched their fists tightly, likely anticipating what would come next. But her eyes still clung to a flicker of hope. With a quivering voice, tinged with the desperate wish that it wasn’t true, she spoke again.

“Why… why was her dress torn?”

“When we found her, she was slumped against a tree, collapsed. And when we approached to check… she was already dead.”

“Won Hye-su…!”

The woman, called Won Hye-su, went blank the moment I finished speaking. She staggered and collapsed to the ground. Cheon Seung-hyeon quickly caught her, but her legs seemed to have completely given out. I knew the pain of losing someone dear better than anyone, and seeing Won Hye-su like this stirred a pang of pity in me.

For a while, silence hung heavy in the air.

“How… how was Hye-yeon found?”

Woo Jeong-min, perhaps having accepted the reality, asked me in a calm tone. But the weight in his voice betrayed the turmoil in his heart. I paused for a moment before answering. He spoke again, still waiting for my response.

“It’s okay. I had a feeling this might be the case. Just tell me exactly what you saw.”

“…There were traces of blood around her mouth. It seemed like she bit her tongue to take her own life.”

“No. Wait. That can’t be. There’s no way she’d kill herself.”

“When we found her, she was nearly naked. And… there was fluid, likely from one of those monkey-like monsters, coming from her lower body.”

The moment I finished, the air turned icy. Woo Jeong-min was visibly furious, his eyes glinting with murderous intent, his fists clenched so tightly they seemed ready to explode. Even Seon Yu-un, who had been listening quietly, had bloodshot eyes, conveying the raw grief and rage they all felt.

Then, it happened. Won Hye-su, who had been staring blankly into space as if my words had shattered her, let out a piercing scream.

“Ha… haha… ha… HAAAAAAA!”

“Hye-su! Snap out of it!”

“AAAAAHH! AAAAAAAHH!”

Her cries were so fierce that even Cheon Seung-hyeon, who had been relatively composed, took a step back. Unable to bear the weight of her loss, Won Hye-su clawed at the ground, screaming.

“No! Hye-yeon! There’s no way Hye-yeon is dead! It’s a lie! A lie! HYE-YEONNNNN!”

“Won Hye-su! Get a grip! We lost Jin-tae, too, remember? You told us back then not to let emotions cloud our judgment, to face reality coldly. How can you act like this now?”

“Shut up! Hye-yeon! Hye-yeon is…!”

Won Hye-su, looking around wildly like a madwoman, locked eyes with me. Her lips twisted with rage, and she suddenly sprang up, charging at me. Seon Yu-un and Cheon Seung-hyeon quickly grabbed her arms, but she still screamed at me with venom.

“Liar! Stop lying! She can’t be dead! It’s a lie, isn’t it? Tell me it’s a lie…! SAY IT!”

“Hye-su… let’s go check for ourselves. Okay? Calm down.”

Cheon Seung-hyeon tried to soothe her, but Won Hye-su was already half-mad, her ears closed to reason. I gazed at her quietly before speaking in a soft voice.

“The body is about thirty minutes down the path behind us. There aren’t many trees around that area. I’m sorry about your sister.”

“You bastard! You killed Hye-yeon! Dead? Stop lying! No way. You saw her being attacked and ran away like a coward, didn’t you? You could’ve saved her, but you fled! You cowardly piece of trash!”

Though I felt for her, Lee Yu-jeong couldn’t stand her insults and started to step forward. I grabbed her shoulder and shook my head quietly. She wore a frustrated expression but, seeing my stern look, backed off. At that moment, Woo Jeong-min, who had been staring silently at the sky, raised his right hand with a calm expression.

*Slap!*

Won Hye-su’s face whipped to the side. She stared at Woo Jeong-min’s hand in disbelief, her cheek red. Woo Jeong-min looked down at her, his face full of disappointment.

“Enough, Won Hye-su. You’re pathetic.”

“Wh-what?”

“Reality… *sigh*. Never mind. You’re not in a state to listen. Stop taking it out on others and face the truth.”

“Ha… fine. I don’t need any of you. It’s not your sister, so you don’t care, right? Sure, that’s it. To you, she’s just someone you met for four days. But to me, to me, TO ME! I’ve lived with her for over twenty years! And you’re telling me to accept reality?”

Seon Yu-un looked at Won Hye-su with pity as she spat venomous words. But in the end, he turned away, unable to meet her gaze. Seeing this, Won Hye-su began sobbing again. To any onlooker, she was a whirlwind of despair, frustration, anxiety, and chaos—a woman on the brink of madness.

“Won Hye-su, are you insane? I shouldn’t talk after throwing that dagger, but you can’t act like this! Calm down and get a hold of yourself. What’s wrong with you?”

“Fine. I’m insane. I *want* to be insane. So let go of me! Let go!”

Her hysteria only grew. Woo Jeong-min let out a heavy sigh before speaking in a grave tone.

“I don’t think you’re insane. We lost Jin-tae here, too. So I understand how it feels to lose a sibling you cherished so much. Anyone who saw how close you and your sister were, even for just four days, would sympathize with you. But… there’s no guarantee that it’s really Won Hye-yeon.”

“Don’t lie! They could be lying, right? They only saw parts of the dress, didn’t they? I’m going to check. I’m going right now. It’s not her. It *can’t* be her.”

They say humans are creatures of self-justification. Won Hye-su, who had been so certain earlier, was now doing a complete 180. She begged, despaired, raged, and clung to hope again. She was spiraling, refusing to accept her sister’s death and grasping only at optimistic interpretations. I’d seen people like her before, but it still left a bitter taste in my mouth.

“Stop it. You saw Hye-yeon being taken by those monkey monsters, didn’t you?”

“If you won’t go, I’ll go alone. Let go of me. I have to go. I’m going now.”

“…Jeong-min. Let’s go check. We’ll confirm it… and if there’s a body…”

Cheon Seung-hyeon started cautiously but clammed up when he saw Won Hye-su’s eyes sharpen. As he and Seon Yu-un released her arms, she glared at me fiercely before sprinting in the direction I’d pointed out. The others exchanged awkward glances before hurrying after her. But Woo Jeong-min stayed behind.

“Sorry for dragging you into this mess. I only knew them for four days, but Hye-su and Hye-yeon cared deeply for each other.”

An-hyeon nodded, his face showing empathy. He held An-sol tightly with his right arm, clearly uneasy. Woo Jeong-min, with a bitter expression, turned to me and spoke in a serious tone.

“Thanks for taking care of those monsters for us. It saved us some trouble. But… you’re not lying about what you said, are you?”

“What did you say?”

Lee Yu-jeong bristled instantly, but Woo Jeong-min glanced at Kim Han-byeol and An-sol before letting out a small chuckle.

“No, you don’t seem like the type to lie. My apologies. I should get going.”

“I’m truly sorry about what happened. We’re in a bit of a hurry ourselves, so we’ll take our leave now.”

“Wait, hold on. You, with the crossbow. Come here for a sec.”

Surprised by the sudden call, I glanced at him and walked over slowly. Once I was close, he scanned my group, then lowered his voice so only I could hear.

“This isn’t much of a thank-you, but I’ll give you a tip. You’re heading to the central Warp Gate, right? Don’t answer—just nod slightly.”

I nodded, and Woo Jeong-min leaned in, whispering something in my ear.
