# Memorize - Chapter 106: Don’t Mess with My Oppa

Even the <Crystal of Truth> cannot evade the Third Eye. After briefly scanning the item’s internal structure, I nodded slightly. Having analyzed how its judgment mechanism works, I could already formulate a way to navigate this tricky situation in my mind. Without hesitation, I placed my hand on the <Crystal of Truth>.

The group’s faces turned to shock at my action. Yu-jeong, in particular, looked like she was on the verge of tears, her face contorted as she bit her lip hard. I glanced at her and the others, then spoke in a calm, steady voice.

“Yu-jeong, I know exactly how you’ve always thought of me.”

“…Oppa.”

“Don’t cry, Yu-jeong.”

At my warm tone, she nodded once and wiped her eyes with her hand.

“If you all trust me, then I trust you too. Yes, I’ve kept things hidden, but there were good reasons for it. And anyway… I was planning to tell you all everything soon.”

I deliberately emphasized “to you all.” As my words sank in, a fleeting look of relief passed over their faces. After reassuring them, I turned my gaze and continued.

“User Jeong Ha-yeon, if this is truly the best way, I’ll infuse my mana without the slightest hesitation.”

“…Very well.”

“But I have my own circumstances to consider.”

I paused, fixing her with a cold stare. Jeong Ha-yeon met my gaze calmly, though her eyes trembled faintly. We both understood the situation. She knew what it meant to bring out this item, and I knew why I was accepting it.

After a brief silence, I continued in a chilling tone.

“Despite those circumstances, I’ve placed my hand on this crystal in front of everyone. I understand your doubts, User Jeong Ha-yeon. But I never thought you’d go this far. I hope you understand how I feel, what it means for me to take this step.”

“…I’ll keep that in mind.”

“And I have one condition.”

“Is it the right to refuse answers?”

I shook my head.

“I’m not placing my hand on the <Crystal of Truth> to satisfy personal curiosity but to clear the doubts you’ve all held. So, I’d prefer you avoid overly intrusive questions or ones driven by personal curiosity.”

I began laying the groundwork. If she was as sharp as I thought, she’d understand what I meant. To put it bluntly, if either of us wanted, we could just walk away. But I liked her, so I was tolerating her pushing me like this. And she liked me too. We both knew it. That’s why she brought out the <Crystal of Truth>. All of this was possible because I’d turned a blind eye.

But by adding that caveat, I drew a line. Based on the abilities I’d shown, I was clearly ahead of her. In cruder terms, I was warning her: “Don’t push your luck.” She responded immediately.

“You’re saying to stay within professional bounds. I’ll keep that in mind.”

After confirming her slight nod, I infused mana into the crystal.

*Wooong…*

As mana flowed into the <Crystal of Truth>, it emitted a bluish glow and began to vibrate faintly. The blue light rose into the air, slowly seeping into my body, and a small, pale flame flickered within the crystal orb.

If I spoke the truth, the crystal would show no change. But if even a hint of falsehood crept into my words, the flame would darken depending on the degree of the lie. With that in mind, I swallowed hard, preparing myself.

Breaking the <Crystal of Truth> wasn’t simple. It was designed to judge truth on its own, but there was one terrifying catch: every word I spoke had to be utterly free of lies, and I had to mean them sincerely. So, I needed to speak the truth while carefully phrasing things ambiguously. Ironically, this worked to my advantage.

Jeong Ha-yeon shook her head as if shaking off a thought, confirmed the crystal’s activation, and parted her delicate lips.

“Please state your name.”

“Kim Su-hyeon.”

“How many years have you been a user?”

“Zero years.”

“Is User Kim Su-hyeon a user just like the rest of us?”

“Yes.”

The questions and answers came quickly. But these were just warm-ups, a prelude to what was coming. After three questions, Jeong Ha-yeon closely examined the crystal. The flame’s color remained unchanged.

She nodded briefly, then resumed in a calm voice.

“User Kim Su-hyeon, you’re hiding something from us. First, I’d like to know why you hid those things.”

“After entering the Hall Plane, I decided it was best to conceal my strength for a while.”

“Why?”

“I didn’t want attention. If my hidden strength was revealed as a new user, some groups might have viewed me with suspicion.”

“Is that the only reason?”

“I wanted to build my strength first. I didn’t want to get caught up in unnecessary trouble from the start.”

Jeong Ha-yeon nodded, seeming to understand. Kim Han-byeol had also gained a Secret Class for some reason but kept it hidden under her clan’s protection. It wasn’t exactly the same, but my reasoning for hiding my strength was similar. Back then, I was wary of attracting unnecessary scrutiny that could hinder my progress.

“Alright. Can you tell us what you’ve been hiding?”

“I can tell you. But what I’m about to share is part of my user information.”

I paused, took a breath, and continued.

“In exchange for sharing my information, User Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong will owe me an equivalent price afterward. Of course, the kids and Vivian are exempt.”

“Agreed. But only if that information is judged true and worth the price.”

“That’s fair.”

Jeong Ha-yeon nodded without hesitation. With their agreement secured, I finally relaxed. It was unlikely, but if they broke their promise…

Steeling myself, I spoke in a dry voice, revealing one of my secrets.

“Then I’ll tell you. First, User Kim Su-hyeon holds a Secret Class as their profession.”

“Ah…!”

The words “Secret Class” sent a ripple through the group. They stared at me, wide-eyed with shock, and I could see Jeong Ha-yeon’s throat bob slightly. She might have suspected it, but the confirmation still surprised her. Ignoring the murmurs around me, I waited for the next question.

“C-Could you tell us… what kind of class it is?”

“It’s a combat-oriented class. And if you ask another question out of personal curiosity, I’ll take my hand off this <Crystal of Truth>.”

My firm tone made Jeong Ha-yeon wince, and she gave a wry smile. The murmurs didn’t die down, though. I wanted a cigarette but had none, so I just waited.

After some time, the commotion subsided. Jeong Ha-yeon quickly checked the crystal, saw the flame’s color hadn’t changed, and sighed.

“Everything you’ve said so far is true. And the Secret Class explains your earlier answers. I’m convinced… but.”

Regaining her composure, her eyes gleamed as she pressed on.

“Even so, you’re just a zero-year user. A zero-year user defeating a high-ranking demon? That’s impossible. I’d like an explanation for this.”

“Wait a moment.”

Just as I was about to respond, Vivian raised her hand. She glanced around with a blank expression, pointed at me, and spoke.

“There’s something we need to address about that.”

“Then say it quickly,” Jeong Ha-yeon urged.

Vivian turned to me.

“When we explored the third floor, I found something interesting. Sang-yong and I discovered traces of a magic barrier designed for high-ranking demons—still active and incredibly strong.”

“I didn’t see it, and I couldn’t sense any barrier at the time,” Jeong Ha-yeon countered.

Vivian and Shin Sang-yong responded in turn.

“That’s possible. The barrier only activates when the demon tries to escape the laboratory. It triggered when the ceiling broke under its final spell.”

“I was there too,” Shin Sang-yong added. “I agree with my master. The high-ranking demon was strong, but it admitted its summoning was incomplete. Combined with the barrier’s suppression, it wasn’t a full-fledged high-ranking demon.”

As they defended me, Jeong Ha-yeon tilted her head, expressionless. Inside, I was barely containing a grin. My party was backing me up. Honestly, I didn’t feel cornered, but the situation was tilting heavily in my favor.

I had to seize this chance. Raising my left hand calmly, I drew up Hwa-jeong’s mana. The same pure flame I’d used against Belphegor flared up, drawing everyone’s attention.

“This is…”

I gave them a moment to take in Hwa-jeong before speaking.

“You saw it briefly on the third floor today. This power isn’t just fire. It’s separate from my Secret Class. And to be clear, this power wasn’t gained through any illicit means. It’s a power the angels know about, obtained through legitimate processes.”

That wasn’t a lie. Even the angels couldn’t question the TANAY rank, so a mere <Crystal of Truth> couldn’t deem my privileges false.

Now was the critical moment.

Jeong Ha-yeon seemed too caught up to notice, but if my words were judged true, there was a glaring contradiction in my actions so far. If she brought up User Jeong Ji-yeon’s case, with my hand on the <Crystal of Truth>, I’d have no choice but to admit my guilt. So, I had two tasks.

The <Crystal of Truth>’s duration wasn’t infinite—actually, it was quite short. I needed a foundation to justify what happened in the Ancient Alchemist’s Dungeon. I recalled how I’d faked a mana backlash in front of the kids in the Black Forest, making them think I’d pushed through the dungeon in that state.

But that was a lie born of acting. I needed to stall until the crystal’s time ran out, so she’d ask her question too late. That meant dangling bait she couldn’t resist. And the bait I chose was Hwa-jeong.

“Can this fire be the basis for your strength, which seems beyond a zero-year user?”

“Of course, my Secret Class is strong enough, but I value this power more, so it’s a valid basis. This isn’t ordinary fire—it holds immense power. As you saw today, it can burn through a demon’s magic. Even I can’t fully gauge its strength.”

Jeong Ha-yeon glanced at the crystal, confirming it judged my words true, and moved to her next question.

“I see. I’m curious how you obtained such a powerful force… but since you say it was through legitimate means, I won’t press. You mentioned the angels know about it, right?”

“Yes.”

“Even if we accept the Secret Class, the other powers you possess are overwhelmingly strong. I know there can be exceptions beyond my expectations, but I understand angels generally treat users equally.”

Not quite.

“So, did the angels say nothing about you using this power? Or are they completely uninvolved?”

Seeing her take the bait, I smirked inwardly.

“There’s a connection. However…”

I deliberately trailed off. After pouring out answers so freely, my sudden pause made curiosity flash across her face. Seeing that, I felt a wave of relief.

She was undeniably sharp and clever, probing here and there to get the answers she wanted. It was admirable, but her opponent was me. This was bound to happen. She was still just a second-year user, while I’d rolled through the shadows of the Hall Plane for ten years. There was a gap she couldn’t yet bridge.

Our questions and answers were slowly shifting in the direction I wanted.
