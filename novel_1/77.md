# Chapter 76: A Bountiful Harvest of Mages

As I opened my eyes to the dim morning light, a cool chill mingled with warm sunlight filled the room. I tapped my head lightly a few times, rubbed my shoulders, and sat up. Bright rays streamed through the window. In the past, I might have grumbled about feeling heavy, but since starting my second cycle, that sensation had vanished. With high endurance and mana, minor injuries or fatigue were easily mended by my natural recovery.

I twisted my neck, and a satisfying *crack* echoed through the room. Relishing the thrill of my bones popping, I shivered briefly before carefully rising from bed. An-hyeon was still fast asleep, oblivious to the world, while Shin Sang-yong, the man lying beside him, rested quietly with his eyes closed. The anesthetic Vivian had injected during her spider days should be wearing off soon. He’d likely wake up today. I mentally counted my tasks for the day and stretched deeply.

Looking out the window, I saw the sun shining brilliantly in the sky. The world was radiant—a perfect day for a picnic with a packed lunch. Extending my senses to the next room, I heard the steady breathing of four users. I grabbed my basic gear, slipped my pouch into my pocket, and left the room.

The creaking wooden stairs led me to the quiet inn lobby, where not a single user was in sight. The Golden Lion Clan’s rush to expedition the Steel Mountains was likely causing this emptiness, and it would only worsen. *Idiots*, I muttered under my breath, taking a seat.

Go Yeon-ju was dozing in the kitchen, perched on a chair. When I deliberately scraped my chair and sat with a thud, her head snapped up, startled. For someone ranked among the <10 Strongest>, failing to notice my presence meant she was either truly asleep or pretending. It didn’t seem like the latter. Go Yeon-ju approached me with half-open eyes, looking worn out. The inn had been busier yesterday, and it seemed to have taken a toll on her. Still, with her stamina, mere inn work shouldn’t exhaust her. Had something happened? Curiosity made me tilt my head, but it was her business, so I opened my mouth to greet her.

“Good morning.”

“Yawn… Good… morning…” 

She stifled yawns mid-sentence, nodding gracefully. Her loose clothing and smooth legs caught my eye, and I awkwardly turned to the menu. Something light for breakfast would do. After a quick scan, I placed my order.

“I’ll have the simple A-course today…”

“Yawn… Ugh. That’s unfair. Making it fresh will take time.”

“I don’t know what’s unfair about it, but whatever’s left from yesterday is fine.”

“I love you.”

Relieved by my leniency, Go Yeon-ju winked and smiled. I brushed off her last remark.

“You seem exhausted from yesterday.”

“Don’t even get me started. Yesterday was rough, and today’s no better. Users kept coming until dawn, drunk guys hitting on me left and right. I had to kick them out one by one, collect food payments, and deal with their messes. I’m beat. My body aches.”

She plopped onto the chair across from me as if she’d been waiting for an invitation. I gave a wry smile, silently wishing the users she’d dealt with a speedy recovery—especially their lower halves. But why was she sitting here? I wished she’d just bring the food. Yet, she kept venting about users hitting on her and how being born pretty was practically a sin.

*Then don’t dress like that*, I thought. Her outfit left half her chest exposed and her thighs barely covered—how could anyone ignore that? Was she enjoying the attention? All sorts of thoughts swirled in my head, but I swallowed the urge to say them. Instead, I shrugged and pulled out a cigarette.

Go Yeon-ju watched me closely, her eyes narrowing. Pouting, she spoke in a dissatisfied tone.

“My, my. Do you hate talking to me that much?”

“Huh? What are you talking about? We were having a fine conversation.”

“I’m very perceptive, you know. You’re thinking, *Just bring the food already*, aren’t you?”

“N-No, that’s not it.”

Her teasing caught me off guard, and I stammered. She’d been chatting softly, but now she stood with a sulky expression, leaving me to sweat awkwardly and force a smile.

“You were so cold yesterday, practically shooing me away. Hmph. Do you think I act like this with just anyone?”

“I was just tired then…”

Her words stung, and she frowned, wrinkling her sleepy eyes and snorting. At a loss for words, I lit my cigarette.

“Ugh, how hurtful. Fine, this innkeeper will fetch your food.”

“It’s a misunderstanding. But could you warm the food a bit?”

“What a guy. Now I look like some clingy fool.”

Muttering to herself—loudly enough for me to hear—she spun around with a gust of wind and headed to the kitchen. One step, two, three, four. I watched her retreating figure, taking a deep drag of my cigarette, the fragrant smoke filling my throat.

When I didn’t stop her, she turned back, sighing heavily as she saw me savoring my cigarette.

“Su-hyeon-ssi, don’t people ever tell you you’re clueless?”

“Huh?”

“When a woman talks like this, shouldn’t you get the hint?”

“…Food first.”

Her expectations dashed, she rolled her eyes as I insisted on the food. Then, with heavy, stomping steps, she closed the distance between us. Bracing myself, I was caught off guard when she reached out and snatched the cigarette from my mouth.

“Hey!”

“This refined lady’s inn is a no-smoking establishment, sir.”

“But it wasn’t yesterday afternoon. Most users were smoking.”

She smiled softly, countering my argument.

“It’s no-smoking in the morning, sir.”

“That’s harsh.”

I grumbled, and she brought my cigarette to her lips, mimicking my earlier shrug. With a cheeky puff, she exhaled.

“Phew. Owner’s prerogative. I’ll smoke it well.”

Blowing a seductive breath toward me, she sauntered back to the kitchen, hips swaying. I pulled out another cigarette. She didn’t stop me this time.

Bread, soup, and meat stew—the simple A-course. As plain as it gets. But who eats a lavish breakfast just to watch a movie? This was just right. Taking a spoonful of stew, I smiled at the tender meat. She’d said she’d bring leftovers, but this was clearly freshly made.

From a distance, Go Yeon-ju watched me with a sulky expression, engrossed in reading some record. When did she turn away? I didn’t know her well, but I knew she was bold with people she liked. Did that mean she liked me? A strange sense of pride lifted my mood.

*Click, click.*

Suddenly, I heard her tongue clicking as she read. No doubt it was a newsletter about the Golden Lion Clan’s antics. She was likely thinking the same as me. Sipping my imaginary *kimchi soup* at the thought of a potential recruitment opportunity, I turned back to my food. That’s when I heard it.

*Tap, tap, tap, tap.*

The sound of someone descending the stairs quietly. It wasn’t An-hyeon or Yu-jeong—they didn’t make that sound. An-sol’s steps were more cautious. These were unsteady yet refined, typical of a mage. The tapping stopped—they’d reached the bottom. Still seated, I raised a hand to signal them over. Hesitant footsteps approached my table.

Sensing someone behind me, I greeted in a low voice.

“You’re awake. Feeling okay?”

“…A bit weak, but I’m fine. So, you’re…”

“Yes, my party rescued you from the dungeon.”

A clear, melodic voice reached my ears. It was definitely the female mage we’d saved. I glanced at Jeong Ha-yeon standing beside me and pointed to the chair across from me. She sat gently, bowing her head.

“Thank you for saving me. I’m Jeong Ha-yeon, a second-year user and a regular mage.”

She expressed gratitude first and then shared her name and class—showing basic courtesy. Giving her a passing grade for first impressions, I studied her face.

She was undeniably beautiful, with a kind demeanor and slightly dazed eyes. Compared to An-sol, Yu-jeong, and Han-byeol, who each had unique charms, Jeong Ha-yeon held her own. Her shoulder-length bob and innocent eyes exuded an elegant, intellectual air—a blend of Han-byeol, An-sol, and Vivian. She’d likely top popularity polls at a university orientation.

“I’m Kim Su-hyeon, a zero-year user, sword class.”

Her eyes widened at “zero-year,” but she nodded at the mention of my party, waiting for me to continue.

Her attitude pleased me, and my expression softened, a faint smile forming. I’d planned to brush off anyone too forward, but Jeong Ha-yeon knew her place. In a gentle tone, I spoke, weaving in information she’d want.

“Since we brought you back from the dungeon yesterday, you’ve probably been unconscious for two or three days. You must be thirsty and hungry. Let’s eat first.”

“You’re kind. Thank you for your generosity. I’ll accept.”

I called Go Yeon-ju for another A-course. Unlike earlier, when it took time, she returned in under five minutes with what was clearly yesterday’s leftovers. I chuckled softly.

As I resumed eating, Jeong Ha-yeon carefully picked up her spoon. She’d stumbled a bit on her way, likely famished, and ate without hesitation. She only looked up after finishing a bowl of soup and a bottle of water.

“Sorry, but… may I ask about the others?”

“Of course. I’ll tell you everything, but maybe finish eating first…”

I deflected on purpose. It’d be easy to say, *“Everyone but Shin Sang-yong is dead. The archer and priest were torn to shreds, and your sister, Jeong Ji-yeon, was used as a monster’s breeding vessel, her belly swollen with pregnancy.”* But I held back out of consideration. Telling her now could shock her, so I wanted her to eat and regain strength first.

Having survived two years in the Hall Plane, she likely sensed my intent. Her face paled, lips trembling, and a tear rolled down her cheek. I added calmly, “It’s not all bad news. Not everyone perished. One person is still unconscious upstairs, so…”

My words seemed to give her some strength, and, realizing her situation, she nodded and wiped her tears.

Glancing over, I saw Go Yeon-ju watching Jeong Ha-yeon with pity. Meeting my eyes, she shook her head. She’d been listening despite acting disinterested. I sighed inwardly.

For a while, the only sound was the clinking of our spoons. Jeong Ha-yeon, perhaps sated by the soup or having lost her appetite, picked at her plate. Seeing her bowed head, I decided it was time and spoke slowly.
