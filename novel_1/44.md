# Chapter 43: Preparations for Takeoff

The cities of the Hall Plane are structured like a spider’s web. Each city, scattered across the continents, plays a distinct yet interconnected role. While they may seem independent at a glance, viewed holistically, they function organically, supporting one another in their respective duties. It wouldn’t be wrong to say they are intricately linked.

The Northern Continent, where my party and I currently reside, is home to numerous cities. At its center lies the great city of Barbara, surrounded by four main cities: Princika to the east, Halo to the west, Khan to the south, and Pamela to the north. Each of these main cities oversees two smaller cities extending diagonally, forming a network of mutual support and reliance.

To elaborate, under the eastern main city of Princika are the smaller cities of Eden to the northeast and Dana to the southeast. The western main city of Halo governs Dorothy to the northwest and Beth to the southwest. The southern main city of Khan oversees Koran to the southeast and Monica to the southwest. Finally, the northern main city of Pamela manages Mul to the northeast and Montana to the northwest.

One great city, four main cities, and eight smaller cities. In some cases, like the Southern Free Alliance, formed by mid-tier clans in the southern main city of Khan, multiple clans jointly manage a city. However, it’s generally more accurate to say that a single representative clan oversees each city.

As mentioned, the clans managing these cities are obligated to fulfill roles suited to their locations. This is unthinkable in the Western Continent, which champions boundless freedom, but the Northern Continent’s dominant force, the Golden Lion Clan, makes it possible.

For example, the southern main city of Khan and its smaller cities, Koran and Monica, are currently focused on conquering the Steel Mountains, the gateway to the Central Continent. In essence, they serve as outposts for advancing into the Central Continent.

Conversely, the northern cities of Pamela, Mul, and Montana border uncharted territories. It’s already known that Atlanta, another great city, lies just beyond the Northern Continent in the Central Continent, though the strength to conquer it is still lacking. The northern uncharted regions, however, remain a true mystery.

Pamela, along with Mul and Montana at the northernmost edge, is tasked with guarding these uncharted territories and stabilizing the surrounding areas. Originally, their roles included exploration or conquest, but I heard through an instructor that such activities are currently prohibited. Additionally, based on information Han-byeol shared with me that night, I’m confident that events I recall are about to unfold.

Initially, I planned to head to the smaller city of Montana in the Northern Continent, but I decided to pivot to Mul. Several factors influenced this choice, but the primary reason is undoubtedly An-hyeon.

Though the details are hazy, I vaguely recall hearing that a rare class related to spears, the Ki-Gong Spearmaster, was discovered in a cave in Mul. I don’t know the specifics of where or how it was obtained, but securing a rare class would significantly bolster our strength, so I intend to investigate.

“Our first destination will be Mul,” I announced.

At the mention of Mul, a small city, puzzled expressions crossed everyone’s faces. Most users operate in great or main cities, so heading to a smaller city must have seemed unexpected. An-hyeon, curious about the reasoning, looked at me with intrigue and asked, “Hyung, isn’t Mul the northernmost city? I heard it’s the most recently pioneered city, so the surrounding areas are dangerous. They say vagrants frequently appear there, and it’s risky unless you’ve built up some strength.”

An-hyeon’s point wasn’t wrong, at least from a general perspective. I wanted to help him develop the ability to assess the broader flow of the Hall Plane, but that would come with experience over time. Still, I was pleased he was thinking this way, so I reached out and ruffled his hair. He looked up at me with a blank expression but didn’t shake off my hand.

To explain the rationale for going to Mul, I first needed to outline the current movements of the Golden Lion Clan. Since An-hyeon and Yu-jeong seemed to have picked up some rumors and sensed the atmosphere, it didn’t take long to explain. When I glanced at Sol, who had been quiet, I noticed her staring at my hand on An-hyeon’s head with a sulky expression. I quickly lowered my hand.

To advance toward Atlanta beyond the Steel Mountains, the Northern Continent faces numerous unresolved issues. While various factors are at play, they can be summed up in one word: stabilization. Have all nearby monsters been cleared? Are there dangerous areas within the sphere of influence? Are there unconquered regions? And, crucially, can interference from vagrants be prevented in advance?

Stabilization holds immense significance in the Hall Plane. If a continent under one’s jurisdiction is fully stabilized, even a failed expedition can be followed by regrouping and rebuilding strength. In other words, only with a solid foundation is it feasible to aim for the Central Continent. The problem lies in the wildly differing opinions among users regarding stabilization.

Recalling the first cycle, I couldn’t help but tsk inwardly as I remembered how the Golden Lion Clan, once hailed as the strongest clan across all continents, met its downfall. They made overly hasty decisions. With newly pioneered cities like Mul still in their infancy, it was hard to claim the Northern Continent was stabilized, even as a formality. Yet, they were preparing for an expedition as if driven by some urgency.

Their stabilization efforts were inadequate, a key factor in their failure. The only notable policy was their victory in a large-scale battle in the western main city of Halo against vagrants, alongside the SSUN Clan, Halo’s representative clan. But they were too complacent. Vagrants, inherently decentralized and nomadic, are like cockroaches with tenacious vitality. A single victory wasn’t enough to let their guard down. Yet, they popped champagne prematurely and marched toward the Steel Mountains, a decision that led to disastrous consequences.

Recalling the timeline, the first expedition to the Steel Mountains occurs roughly six months after my entry into the Hall Plane. Considering the thirteen weeks since the User Academy, about three months remain until the expedition. Even factoring in the period after the expedition’s return when clans are cautiously observing, we have about 100 days. During that time, I need to establish a foothold and build our strength as much as possible.

In that regard, the northern smaller cities of Mul and Montana are ideal for my plans. Signs are already emerging that, as part of expedition preparations, efforts to clear out vagrants are gaining momentum. Users with keen instincts would sense the brewing tension across the Northern Continent.

I suspected vagrants were also retreating deeper into the shadows, moving covertly. Before being picked off individually as a decentralized group, they’re likely gathering quietly, waiting for the right moment to rise in the Western Continent. If my predictions are correct, the upcoming storm will hit the western and southern regions, where attention is currently focused. This makes the eastern and northern regions relatively safer from their threats.

“The areas around famous cities are already picked clean,” I explained. “While they may not be fully conquered, they’ve been largely pioneered. That means heavy competition with many users and established clans, which would make our activities challenging.”

“But, Hyung, like you said, and from what I’ve heard, a large-scale expedition might happen soon,” An-hyeon countered.

I shook my head immediately. We currently lack any qualifications to join an expedition. Rather than getting caught in the crossfire of a major conflict, it’s far more advantageous to start from the ground up, taking steady, solid steps forward.

“Who’s to say the expedition will succeed?” I replied. “Even Barbara, the great city we’re in now, took four years of preparation and countless sacrifices to be pioneered. Conquering the Steel Mountains, which is clearly more difficult than Barbara, with the same four years of preparation seems unlikely.”

“Hmm… really? Hearing you say that makes me think it might be true,” An-hyeon mused.

“Oppa, so you’re saying there’s still a lot to gain in Mul?” Yu-jeong asked.

Despite my explanation, the kids still seemed reluctant to let go of their ambitions. Fresh out of the User Academy with top ranks, their confidence was understandable, but I couldn’t permit recklessness. I spoke with more force, “Don’t worry about vagrants. Both existing users and vagrants are focused on the upcoming expedition. I’ve heard Mul is currently stagnant because users have suddenly left, abandoning its development. Their departure means more opportunities for us.”

Naturally, I couldn’t reveal everything, so my words carried a degree of speculation, framed as “it’s likely to be this way.” Knowing the future, I could speak with certainty, but whether the kids would accept it was another matter. I looked at their faces with a serious expression.

An-hyeon was mulling over my words with a grave look. Yu-jeong also appeared deep in thought. But An-sol, who had been silent for a while… what’s with her? Why was she pouting and staring at me? Was she upset about something? I smacked my lips and averted my gaze from her. At that moment, Yu-jeong raised her head and spoke in an uncharacteristically serious tone.

“Oppa.”

“Yeah?”

“Can I ask something?”

“Of course, go ahead.”

I thought I’d explained everything thoroughly enough to leave no questions, but apparently, something was unclear. Still, it was far better for them to ask questions or, like An-hyeon, express their thoughts than to blindly follow. I nodded readily.

With my permission, Yu-jeong sidled up close to me and gently took my hand. Instead of asking her question, she started fidgeting. As I watched her silently, she brought my hand to her lips. Her mouth opened, revealing neat, white teeth, and then…

*Chomp.*

With a provocative glint in her eyes, Yu-jeong bit my hand.

“…”

“…”

“…”

An-hyeon, An-sol, and I froze in an instant.

“You told me to ask,” she mumbled with my hand still in her mouth, smirking. “So I did.”

I looked down at her, dumbfounded, as she giggled and released my hand. An-hyeon gave her a look of disdain, while An-sol, embarrassed, glanced around nervously.

I tried to maintain a calm facade, but I was irritated. We were discussing critical plans for our journey, and she pulls this stunt? I couldn’t help but think she was acting crazy. If this were the old days, or if someone else—like Lee Ji-yeong—had done this, I’d have scowled immediately. But this was Yu-jeong.

From observing her, I knew Yu-jeong had a tendency to intensely dislike certain people, like Park Dong-geol, to an almost pathological degree. Conversely, she could be playful and affectionate with those she liked, which is why I barely swallowed the frustration rising in my throat. Still, I resolved to teach her to mind the time and place in the future. Before I could speak, An-hyeon, sensing my mood, scolded her first.

“Hey, Hyung’s talking about something important. What’s with that behavior?”

“Sorry, really sorry. Oppa, I’m so sorry. Your face was just so serious, I couldn’t help myself,” Yu-jeong apologized.

“It’s a matter of life and death, of course it’s serious,” An-hyeon retorted, his face sullen.

Yu-jeong shot him a playful glare before continuing, her mood oddly cheerful. “Back at the academy, whenever we asked, Oppa just kept saying he was ‘thinking.’ I had no idea you were thinking about stuff like this. Honestly, I couldn’t even imagine thinking this way… but anyway, I decided to follow you from the start, right? I’m all in!”

An-hyeon nodded in agreement, letting out a low hum. He muttered under his breath, “As if you could think like this,” but Yu-jeong swiftly kicked his shin. He glared at her, but when she stared back, he clicked his tongue and turned to me.

“Listening to you, Hyung, I think going to Mul makes sense. So, how are we getting there? It’s the northernmost city, so walking would take too long.”

I felt relieved. An-hyeon’s sensible question helped restore the conversation’s focus. Letting out an inward sigh, I responded calmly, “We should get there as fast as possible. We’re not the only ones with this idea, so the fewer competitors, the better. Less skilled users might give up on expeditions or battles and head to uncharted areas. Let’s use a warp gate.”

Every city has a warp gate, with fees calculated based on distance—the closer, the cheaper. For Mul, the northernmost city, it’d likely cost about 2 Gold per person (1 Gold = 100 Silver = 10,000 Bronze).

An-hyeon looked concerned. “I heard warp gate fees are expensive…”

I almost said, “You got your weekly stipend, didn’t you?” but I paused to gather my thoughts before continuing, “I heard that, as part of a policy to encourage pioneering, warp gate fees to frontier cities are discounted. That might end soon given the current situation, but it should still be in effect. How much did you all save from your stipends?”

The three of them exchanged glances. Surely they didn’t spend it all? There’s nowhere to spend it, anyway. As I, the one with 1,000 Gold, started to worry unnecessarily, they suddenly burst into laughter, looking at each other. Then, Yu-jeong thrust a pouch toward me with a bright voice.

“This is all the money Hyung, Sol, and I saved from our stipends. It’s probably around 7 Gold and 80 Silver.”

“Why am I managing this? It’s your money,” I said, caught off guard.

“Not ‘your’ money—‘our’ money,” Yu-jeong corrected immediately.

An-hyeon, looking sheepish, chimed in, “We thought it’d be better if you managed it.”

“And I tend to impulse-buy,” Yu-jeong added, sticking out her tongue playfully.

I stared at them, momentarily dazed. Meeting their trusting gazes, a fresh, unfamiliar emotion stirred within me, rippling through my core. Forcing it down, I tossed the pouch into the air and caught it again—a meaningless gesture. But the weight of the gold coins in my hand felt heavier than usual.
