# Chapter 33: Boss Monster

Kim Han-byeol never took her eyes off me. Her gaze urged me to get up and run, but I had no intention of doing so. It seemed my companions had thoroughly misunderstood the situation.

As a flash of blue light signaled the end of the warp gate’s activation, I saw that everyone except me had been teleported. 

Gone?  
They’re gone.  
Yeah, they’re gone.

Dark shadows began to envelop me, piling up around my surroundings. The boss monster, seemingly unconcerned about losing its other prey, growled incessantly as it fixed its gaze on me. I planted both hands on the ground and slowly rose to my feet. After rolling around for the first time in a while, my body felt stiff and sore. I twisted slightly to loosen my waist, hearing the satisfying crack of my joints.

I stared at the crossbow I had relied on until now, then let it fall to the ground. It was no longer needed. With a dull thud, the crossbow hit the dirt and rolled. Without hesitation, I stepped on it, crushing it beneath my foot.

*Crunch!*

Seeing the crossbow snap in half, I turned my impassive face toward the spot where my companions had dropped their gear. Channeling my mana to manifest the art of telekinesis, I summoned the longsword An-hyeon had left behind. It spun through the air and landed perfectly in my hand.

At last, I held the longsword.

Throughout the Rite of Passage, one thing that had felt foreign was the absence of a blade in my hand. In the Hall Plane, my sword was as vital to me as life itself. I kept it by my side when I slept, ate, even bathed. Perhaps that’s why handing my sword to An-hyeon had left me feeling as though I’d lost a comrade.

But now, it was over. I could return to the Hall Plane. How long had I yearned for this moment? How desperately had I wished to come back? What I once thought was a dream had become reality the moment I obtained the Zero Code. Now, I was just one step away. My chest swelled with emotion.

As if responding to my burning passion, the Fire Spirit slumbering in my heart stirred. My heart pounded fiercely, and the blood coursing through every corner of my body felt like it was ablaze. My stalled breath and dormant heart roared back to life. This was the prelude to a long, new war, on the verge of beginning.

*ROOOOAR!*

The boss monster’s bellow echoed. I quietly gazed at the sword in my hand before facing it. I had surpassed my past self in skill, but there was no guarantee I was the strongest. Yet, I felt no fear. Even if I fell into the abyss again, even if I suffered great wounds once more, I had sworn never to give up. Without a trace of worry, I raised my sword and aimed it at the boss monster.

The moment I truly wielded my sword, the air around me shifted dramatically.

> **[Special Ability: Mind and Sword as One (Rank EX) activated. All sword-related actions receive additional positive modifiers. Due to years of seasoned experience, numerous achievements, and class bonuses, a 2-rank enhancement is applied.]**

> **[Potential Ability: Close-Quarters Combat (Rank A+) activated. This ability surpasses the limits for those wielding melee weapons. You will never be outmatched in close combat. Due to seasoned experience and class bonuses, a 1-rank enhancement is applied.]**

I was once a Sword Master, and now I am a Sword Specialist. With abilities and a class tied to the sword, the difference in my power with and without one was like heaven and earth. If my presence before was like a fleeting cloud, now it was a storm of killing intent, radiating the clear resolve: *I will kill you.*

To my eyes, the boss monster was utterly insignificant, less than an insect. As I took a step forward, it instinctively took a step back. It couldn’t be helped. No matter how cunning, it was still a beast, driven by primal instincts. Realizing the vast gap in our levels, it had already lost the will to fight.

My swordsmanship is rooted in the principles of Taiji. Rather than overpowering with brute force, I utilize techniques that redirect both my strength and my opponent’s. For someone like me, whose physical strength fell short compared to top-tier users, this was the only way. To elaborate, it employs the principles of *jeon-gi-chi-yu* (focusing on softness through energy) and *i-yu-geuk-gang* (overcoming hardness with softness), with the essence being to subdue motion with stillness.

I slowly lowered my sword. Since I couldn’t expect the monster to strike first, I would take the initiative. My current stance was a preparatory one, unique to my sword-drawing technique. I knew it might appear defenseless.

But that was the point—my opponent couldn’t predict the direction of my first strike. If I swung my sword at lightning speed, they would either fall before reading my trajectory or cede the initiative entirely.

Looking at the trembling boss monster, I drew my sword in an instant.

And then—

My sword aura tore through the air, charging toward it without hesitation.

---

“One-Strike Kill. An impressive sword-drawing technique, User Kim Su-hyeon. Congratulations on surviving the Rite of Passage. As of Day 6, 16:42:27, you have earned the right to enter the Hall Plane.”

I had cleaved the boss monster in half with a single stroke. Returning to the Summoning Room, those were the first words Seraph spoke to me. She stood atop a small altar, her glowing wings shimmering as she gazed at me calmly. It hadn’t even been a week, but it felt like ages since I last saw her. I gave a curt nod and slumped to the floor.

“What about the others?”

It was an abrupt question, but the Rite of Passage was different from the Hall Plane. There were no restrictions on observing users here. Since she had surely watched my performance, she must have seen my companions too.

“Sharing information about other users is not permitted.”

“I’m not asking for their measurements or anything. Just tell me if they made it in safely. Don’t be so uptight.”

Hearing my words, Seraph let out a deep sigh before responding in a calm tone.

“Users An-hyeon, An-sol, Lee Yu-jeong, and Kim Han-byeol have been successfully transported to the Summoning Room. They are currently on standby with their assigned angels.”

“I see. So, they get half a day of training before entering the Hall Plane?”

“The training doesn’t take that long. However, we must unlock classes and abilities tailored to each user’s characteristics. While User Kim Su-hyeon completed this process efficiently on your own, do not assume the same for others.”

Her words silenced me. When I survived the seven days and returned to the Summoning Room in the past, I had learned the basics of the Hall Plane, completed my initial setup, and entered. That process had felt like half a day.

“All users are sent to the Hall Plane collectively. Therefore, we must wait for those who qualify by the end of Day 7 of the Rite of Passage.”

“Then let me at least—”

“Absolutely not.”

This wasn’t welcome news. I had deliberately dispatched the boss monster quickly for this very reason. I asked just in case, but Seraph cut me off before I could finish, prompting a scowl as I grumbled.

“So you’re saying I have to stay here for nearly a day and a half? Just waiting around? What, am I supposed to play pat-a-cake with you?”

Despite my irritated tone, Seraph replied clearly.

“If you wish, I can accommodate that. For users who pass early, we typically provide more detailed information about the Hall Plane.”

“No thanks.”

“Then shall we play pat-a-cake?”

I shook my head at her serious response. This angel clearly didn’t get jokes. Since I was stuck here, I decided to ask about a few things that had puzzled me during the Rite of Passage, though I laced my tone with a bit of sarcasm. At my suggestion to talk, Seraph tilted her head slightly before nodding.

“While going through the Rite of Passage, I couldn’t help but wonder—did you guys even consider balance?”

“Yes.”

Her curt reply didn’t satisfy me.

“…Dropping us in the middle of a forest and throwing in wraiths, fine. But what’s with summoning a boss monster? What kind of sadistic setup is this? There’s no way rookie users can pass something like that.”

“Is there a problem?”

“If I hadn’t been there, our entire group would’ve been wiped out. I can’t wrap my head around why you’d unleash a monster like that.”

Seraph responded without a hint of hesitation.

“The Rite of Passage is automatically balanced to the level of the participating users each cycle. Though, admittedly, this cycle excluded User Kim Su-hyeon for balancing purposes. Regardless, this year’s users rank among the top five in potential in the history of the Rite.”

“Even so, a boss monster? Users can’t even use mana. How are they supposed to beat it?”

“Defeating it is impossible. There’s a specific strategy. The boss monster is randomly summoned between 200 and 300 meters from the warp gate. Facing it alone is unfeasible, but with at least five users, one can reach the warp gate.”

I immediately understood her implication.

“…So, up to four people are bait while one escapes.”

“Correct.”

I was speechless. But it also clarified why the boss monster was placed near the warp gate. Those who pass must experience the grief of losing comrades they fought alongside. In the Hall Plane, such losses are commonplace, so the Rite seems designed to deliver a similar shock from the start.

It felt like cruel taste, but I had no retort. After all, my return was partly driven by my inability to cope with a similar sense of loss. Sighing inwardly, I was about to change the subject when Seraph spoke first.

“I acknowledge the difficulty was significant. For reference, the four users who arrived first simultaneously have been awarded a small Gold Point bonus.”

“…Oh? But there shouldn’t be anyone who passed before us. What about me?”

“User Kim Su-hyeon passed fifth. The aforementioned four are tied for first. They will each receive 2,500 Gold Points as a reward.”

Nice. That was good news. 2,500 Gold Points in the early stages could be a huge help. Gold Points, usable at the user shop, are incredibly valuable early on. My eyes lit up as I spoke.

“Gold Points, huh? Give me some too.”

“Unfortunately, the reward is only for first place. Originally, one user would receive 10,000 points, but since four tied this time, it was divided equally. User Kim Su-hyeon is not eligible.”

Bummer. I smacked my lips in disappointment but nodded. 2,500 points would’ve covered early expenses or let me buy a beginner’s weapon. Noticing my reaction, Seraph looked puzzled and spoke.

“User Kim Su-hyeon, you seem quite disappointed. It’s only 2,500 points.”

“Gold Points don’t grow on trees.”

“That’s true. But User Kim Su-hyeon currently holds exactly 3,784,720 Gold Points. I don’t see why you’d care about a mere 2,500.”

…What?
