# Chapter 57: Dungeon of Alchemist (2)

"Hold on, we need to change formation for a bit."  
"Huh? Oh, okay. How…?"  
"Line up single file behind me. And whoever’s behind grabs the hem of the person in front. Don’t let go, no matter what."  

Under normal circumstances, they might have questioned why, but the kids immediately sprang into action at my words. A brief commotion ensued, but soon I felt An-sol, who had claimed the spot right behind me, grip my hem tightly with a bright smile. I could roughly guess why they were moving so briskly.

After confirming that An-sol, Yu-jeong, and An-hyeon were lined up behind me in that order, I continued in a calm voice.  
"From now on, we’re entering a space called a Path Barrier. If you take even one wrong step, we could get separated. So, don’t ever—*ever*—let go of the person in front of you. If possible, step exactly where I step. And… never mind. Let’s go."  

I wanted to add, *Don’t be startled no matter what happens*, but I held back on purpose. I couldn’t predict what kind of scenes we’d encounter ahead. After steadying myself, I took slow, deliberate steps forward.

The kids followed my instructions diligently, though I could still sense occasional curious glances floating with questions. Keeping my Third Eye active, I stepped forward cautiously, one foot at a time.

One step. Two steps. Three steps… My gaze was fixed downward, following my own footprints, but I could feel that I was heading in the right direction. The grass surrounding us was regaining its original shimmering hue. The occasional gasps of awe from behind only reinforced my confidence.

That said, the Alchemist’s Dungeon wasn’t going to appear right away. The kids might be casually trailing behind me, but I was maintaining a high level of focus, tracking every trace with precision. Sustaining the Third Eye for so long wasn’t exactly a walk in the park either.

How much time had passed?

"Phew. You can let go now."  

We had fully entered the barrier and reached our target destination. After over forty minutes of relentless tracking, the strange air that had enveloped us seemed to have dissipated. I let out a deep breath, still feeling the hands clutching my hem. Every now and then, they tugged hard enough to be annoying.

I turned my head slightly, intending to get Sol to let go, and grabbed the back of her hand. A soft, warm sensation brushed against my palm. Startled, An-sol looked at me, her face quickly flushing red. I was just trying to tell her to stop tugging because it was irritating, but…

She turned her palm and grabbed my hand tightly, refusing to let go. I had to pry her fingers off before motioning to the others with a flick of my hand. At my signal, Hyeon and Yu-jeong gathered beside me. They were all staring at me blankly, so I pulled them further inward.

"Wow…"  

An-hyeon let out a gasp as he gazed at the ancient marble castle looming before us. When I pointed ahead, Sol and Yu-jeong also stared at the castle with dazed expressions. After trudging through a gloomy forest, the sight of a castle surrounded by shimmering grass seemed to leave them speechless.

An-hyeon, who had been gawking for a while, finally spoke in a voice tinged with awe.  
"This castle…"  
"It’s presumed to be the dungeon of the ancient alchemist Vivian," I said. "We won’t know for sure until we go inside, though."  

Seeing the kids’ stunned faces, I felt a quiet sense of pride. Choosing my Unique Ability had been a tough decision. I’d passed up other incredible abilities to pick the Third Eye because it seemed like the most versatile and effective tool in Hall Plane. In the past, finding caves or dungeons had been a grueling ordeal, even with all my effort. Now, with just a bit of information, I’d tracked this place down, and it felt like I’d made the right choice.

"Hyung… I had my doubts, but I never thought you’d actually find it," An-hyeon said.  
"I didn’t know either," I replied humbly. "I just followed the traces and my gut… Beginner’s luck, maybe?"  

An-hyeon’s eyes gleamed with admiration as he looked at me. I brushed it off modestly. If they were this shocked already, how would they handle it when we set out on expeditions and kept stumbling into places like this? But I couldn’t let myself get too excited. The peaceful scenery around us might have them marveling, but I knew better than anyone what kind of hell awaited inside.

"Hehe, Oppa, this castle is so pretty! I thought dungeons were supposed to be creepy and gloomy," Yu-jeong chirped.  

*You’re not wrong. Just wait until we go inside and head underground.* I kept that response to myself. I didn’t want to dampen the mood just yet. An-sol, her face brimming with excitement, spoke up too.  
"It feels like we’re looking at a fortress from a movie…"  

As Sol spoke with dreamy eyes, I noticed a bitter expression flicker across An-hyeon’s face. I wasn’t sure why, but the word "movie" seemed to trigger something in him.

Yu-jeong looked eager to rush inside, her body practically vibrating with anticipation as she urged me forward. Just moments ago, the kids had been subdued, but the change in environment had shifted their moods again. They were such mood-driven creatures.

"Oppa, you’re amazing! There wasn’t even a hint of this castle when we passed by earlier. How did you find it?"  
"I don’t know. Just lucky, I guess."  
"Ugh, come on! I know you’re always studying those records and stuff. Did you really just pluck a star from the sky like you said?"  

I gave a faint smile at Yu-jeong’s words. For a moment, Kim Han-byeol flashed through my mind. I wondered what she was doing now. If she’d come with us… I shook my head. If it was just the two of us, she’d probably be nitpicking and arguing nonstop.

Anyway, it was too early to let my guard down. No, this was just the beginning. As I started walking toward the castle, the kids hurriedly followed, stumbling over themselves to keep up.

"Wait a second."  

I stopped in front of the castle gate. There were clear traces leading inside, which meant another caravan had already discovered this dungeon and entered. Judging by the tracks, there were five sets of footprints. Either the group had started with five people, or one had died along the way. Tilting my head briefly, I cautiously pushed open the heavy door blocking our path.

*

"Whoo."  
"Ooh…"  

We stepped into the grand castle. The kids were so busy gawking at the interior that they were spinning their heads around. The circular lobby wasn’t exactly pristine, even by generous standards. Broken chairs and shattered windows caught the eye immediately. The atmosphere had an old-world charm but carried a faintly eerie undercurrent.

Still, the white marble ceiling was pleasant to look at. The large, domed ceiling, supported by marble pillars, bore a striking resemblance to a European cathedral.

"What’s this? No treasure or monsters? Did someone already clean this place out?" Yu-jeong asked, her voice tinged with disappointment.  

*You think it’d be that easy?* I pressed a hand to my forehead and pointed toward the center of the room. There, embedded in the floor, was a wooden trapdoor with an iron ring attached.

"Aha! A secret base!"  
"…It’s a door to the underground dungeon. How old are you, calling it a secret base?"  
"Tch. Same thing. Oppa, you always pick on me!"  

The discovery of the castle seemed to have her hyped up again. Just earlier, she’d been sulking like a scolded puppy, but now she was getting cheeky again. Deciding to let it slide for now, I took a step back.

The original meaning of "dungeon" is an underground prison. The absence of monsters in the castle lobby was a bit surprising, but not entirely unexpected. Either there were never any monsters here to begin with, or the caravan that came before us had already cleared them out. Given the lack of bodies or signs of combat, the former seemed more likely.

"So, we go in through here?" An-hyeon asked.  
"Exactly. We didn’t come all this way just to look at the outside and leave."  

I nodded simply and grabbed the handle. The door looked heavy, but with my Strength stat nearing 94, it was no match. With one firm pull, a grating creak echoed, and the door swung open, revealing a large, square hole in the floor.

"It doesn’t look too deep. I’ll go first, then you follow one by one."  

After speaking, I leaped down. The faintly visible floor below grew closer, and with a *thud*, I landed smoothly. Seeing me descend without issue, An-hyeon and Yu-jeong nodded to each other and jumped down together.

Another *thud* kicked up a cloud of dust. An-hyeon, with his high physical stats, landed with a calm expression, unfazed. Yu-jeong, however, had one knee on the ground, clutching her foot.

I approached, wondering if she’d hurt herself. She looked up with a teary face and whined, "Ugh… I landed wrong."  

An-hyeon and I exchanged a sigh. Looking up, I saw Sol still hesitating above. She wavered for a moment but, after An-hyeon’s teasing, "You’ll get snatched by ghosts if you stay up there alone," she squeezed her eyes shut and jumped. She clearly didn’t want to be left behind. Watching her leap so gracefully… wait, with her eyes closed?

"Catch me!"  

Sol screamed as she descended, eyes still tightly shut. An-hyeon and I exchanged puzzled glances, tilting our heads. Yu-jeong, watching us, sighed in exasperation. *Who’s she to sigh at us?*

*Splat!*

"Kyaa!"  

A soft, squelching sound echoed as Sol let out a sharp cry, hitting the ground hard. Rubbing her sore backside, she looked up at us with a face full of betrayal. She probably hadn’t expected that no one would actually catch her.

Seeing her pout, I felt a strange sense of unease. She’d landed on her backside, but instead of a *thud*, there was that soft, squishing sound. I quickly channeled my mana to enhance my vision, sharpening my senses. And then…
