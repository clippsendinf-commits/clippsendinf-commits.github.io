# Chapter 109: Same Question, Different Result

As expected, I found a door cleverly blended into the floor at the spot where Belphegor and I had clashed. It resembled the structure I’d seen in the lobby of the castle when I discovered the Ancient Alchemist’s Dungeon, leading underground. It wasn’t that I hadn’t noticed it before; I simply hadn’t activated my Third Eye back then. In this world, there’s practically nothing that can deceive the Third Eye.

Opening the door to the underground, I found a staircase descending into the darkness. Before entering, I carefully scanned the area below with my detection ability. Confirming no dangerous reactions, I leaped down without hesitation.

“Light.”

Jeong Ha-yeon, who followed me, immediately cast a Light spell. As a glowing orb rose, illuminating the pitch-black interior, the secret room hidden underground revealed itself to us.

“Whoa…”

An-hyeon’s gasp echoed. The secret room felt more cramped than the ones on the first floor. Along one wall, wooden crates and barrels, still holding their shape, were neatly stacked. There was also a worn bed, a drawer, a table, and scattered dishes on the table. It didn’t seem designed for any special purpose.

Approaching the bed, I lifted the sheet. Beneath it lay old bone fragments, resting quietly. I stared at them for a moment before gently covering them again. Turning around, I addressed the group standing still.

“This is the last room. I don’t know what’s here, but search thoroughly and don’t miss anything.”

At my command, the kids scattered eagerly. The anticipation of finishing the exploration and the excitement of what we might find seemed to energize them. Watching Shin Sang-yong, Jeong Ha-yeon, and Vivian move calmly, I activated my detection and Third Eye once more.

“…”

I didn’t need to keep the detection active for long. Bending down, I reached under the bed and swept my hand in a wide arc. I felt several objects catch on my arm. The saying “the darkest place is under the lamp” came to mind. Pleased at finding something so quickly, I pulled everything out.

Seeing the items caught on my arm, I couldn’t help but cheer inwardly. The realization that the things I’d half-doubted were coming true sent a thrill through me. Though I hadn’t checked their information yet, I was certain these were what I’d expected.

There were four items in total: a black spear, slightly thicker and longer than a standard one; a refined, rectangular wooden box that could fit in one hand; a tattered book that looked like it might crumble at a touch; and a single glove.

My gaze lingered on the glove. It was a blue-black leather glove, simple yet adorned with a chain that shimmered like moonlight on its surface. The fact that it was only one glove, not a pair, was a slight issue, but I didn’t mind too much.

Just in case, I lay flat on the floor to check under the bed for the other glove. Nothing.

“Ugh, just break it! We’re done here anyway!”

“Sounds good.”

From behind, I heard An-hyeon and Yu-jeong smashing crates. Frustrated that things weren’t going as planned, their tempers must have flared, leading them to break everything.

With a thrill of excitement, I kept my Third Eye active and turned my attention to the dusty items. If my guesses were correct, these were likely relics of a Ki-Gong Spearmaster.

As I analyzed them with my Third Eye, information about the items began to appear one by one.

**Spear of Raven**

*A black spear crafted from an alloy of steel (85.6%), mithril (12.7%), and adamantium (1.6%). Forged with great care by a skilled ancient blacksmith, this high-performance spear prioritizes durability and sharpness. While steel is the primary material, mithril is distributed throughout to greatly enhance mana efficiency. A small amount of adamantium is concentrated at the spearhead’s core, increasing its strength. No additional magical enhancements were applied, making it a practical weapon focused on resilience and precision. However, this spear holds the latent power to awaken the path of a Ki-Gong Spearmaster. If paired with the spearmaster’s records, it can unlock even greater potential.*

**Elixir**

*A concoction of rare elixirs. Users with a Strength stat of 70 or below can expect a slight increase (1–2 points) in their Strength stat upon consumption.*

**Records of the Ancient Spearmaster**

*The records of a renowned ancient spearmaster, detailing insights, techniques, and expertise gained through training. If paired with the black spear they wielded, the user can attain a higher level of power.*

**Glove of Reduction**

*A single glove, the only one remaining due to unknown circumstances. This left-hand glove reduces the weight of any object held to one-fifth of its original weight. If the right-hand glove is found to complete the pair, the weight reduction improves to one-sixth, and a slight (2-point) increase in Strength stat can be achieved.*

“Haa…”

“I found a pouch! Oppa, oppa! I… what are you doing?”

Yu-jeong’s voice called out from behind, but I was too absorbed to respond. After all the effort, the reward had come—not that there was much effort, to be honest. Still, the Ki-Gong Spearmaster had indeed been lying dormant near the small city of Mul.

Following the Chimera Alchemist, now the Ki-Gong Spearmaster. This was no small matter. I recalled the moment Vivian handed me a book, the same overwhelming joy and excitement surging within me. Clenching my fist, unable to suppress a smile, I stood up.

“Oppa? Oppa~? What’s with you~?”

Yu-jeong’s teasing voice came from beside me. I reached out and pulled her close. She flinched at first but soon nestled against me playfully, burying her head in my shoulder. Seeing the items on the floor, her eyes widened.

“Looks like we hit the jackpot. Haha.”

“Is that a spear? Damn, An-hyeon’s gonna be thrilled.”

I tried to push Yu-jeong’s head away, but she leaned back in, stubbornly resisting.

“Hey, move your head.”

“No way. You pulled me in first. Let’s stay like this a bit longer. I get why Sol’s always clinging to you. Feels nice.”

Sighing, I withdrew my hand.

Choosing the Third Eye as my Unique Ability was truly a stroke of genius. The dungeons, expeditions, and rare classes I’d searched for so desperately in my first cycle were now popping up one after another.

I knew luck played a part in this, but what mattered was that we’d found two Rare Classes in a row. The fact that An-hyeon, fiercely loyal to me and the group, was about to become a Rare Class user was incredibly promising.

Calming my racing heart, I reached for the black spear. Brushing away the thick dust, I grasped the cold, raven-black metal. A surge of immense power flowed into me, and this time, it wasn’t my Third Eye but Hall Plane’s system messages that appeared in the air.

*Congratulations. You have discovered a Rare Class. By wielding the Spear of Raven and accepting its power, you can evolve into a Ki-Gong Spearmaster (Energy SpearMan).*

*The Ki-Gong Spearmaster is an advanced class of spearmen. They possess unique martial and spear techniques, maximizing their effectiveness by efficiently utilizing internal energy. Methods to train in these martial and spear techniques are detailed in the predecessor’s records. This class is recommended for users skilled in close-combat, particularly those proficient with spears.*

*Your current class, Sword Specialist (Secret Class), is the highest tier of the swordsman lineage. While you can acquire the spearmaster’s records, your Unique, Special, and Potential Abilities indicate an overall efficiency reduction to below 40%. However, your Strength stat (94 points) and Agility stat (98 points) recover 20% of the loss. Additionally, your EX-rank Special Ability, Mind and Sword as One, recovers another 20%. You can wield any weapon effectively, but efficiency will be lower compared to a sword. As you have already unlocked all Special and Potential Abilities, acquiring the Ki-Gong Spearmaster’s power is not recommended.*

The room wasn’t large, and with seven of us searching, it didn’t take long to finish. Soon, reports came in from the group.

“Hyung, nothing here.”

“Oppa, I found a pendant… huh?”

An-hyeon waved his hand with a sigh, while An-sol, waving a pendant, gasped upon seeing me with Yu-jeong. I quickly pushed Yu-jeong’s head away.

“Ugh, I got nothing either.”

“Same here, Master.”

Vivian and Shin Sang-yong showed me their empty hands with disappointed looks. Meanwhile, Jeong Ha-yeon, who had been checking a drawer, held up a shimmering chain.

“I found a necklace. It feels like it has some magical energy.”

Jeong Ha-yeon and An-sol handed me their finds. I dropped them onto the pile of items I’d discovered. Seeing the relics of the ancient Ki-Gong Spearmaster, everyone’s eyes widened, except for Yu-jeong’s.

“We’ll need to take stock, but let’s handle the urgent matter first.”

“Urgent? I just wanna get back to the city…”

Vivian’s grumbling trailed off as I gave her a stern look. She quickly changed her tune.

“Wow, I’m so curious about these items! So curious!”

“…An-hyeon, come here.”

“Yes.”

An-hyeon approached obediently. I bent down, picked up the Spear of Raven, and lifted it slowly. Seeing the spear, he grinned, likely thinking I was giving it to him. I was certain that grin would soon turn to shock.

“An-hyeon, listen carefully.”

“Heh, whatever you say, I’m ready.”

Smiling wryly at his eager expression, I continued quietly.

“When you hold this spear, Hall Plane messages will appear. Read them all and accept the power in your heart. Whatever you do, don’t drop the spear. Got it?”

“Huh? I don’t get it. Just do what you say, right? What’s so special about it?”

“Ugh, just remember what I said and follow the messages. You’ll understand soon enough.”

“Heh, now I’m excited. Hand it over, hyung.”

I passed the spear to An-hyeon. The moment he grasped it, his body stiffened. Watching him, I let out a faint smile. With my high mana and blessings, I could handle the spear’s power effortlessly, but An-hyeon, with his lower mana stat, was clearly struggling.

“Uh… uh…”

An-hyeon’s eyes fixed on the air, his face showing panic. A small commotion stirred among the group. I raised my hand to silence them.

“Everyone, quiet. The succession ritual is more challenging than it seems. The quieter it is, the better, so please stay silent and just watch.”

“Succession… ritual?”

Yu-jeong, standing beside me, asked in a skeptical tone. I nodded once and answered.

“Yes. This spear allows the wielder to inherit the Rare Class Ki-Gong Spearmaster. The succession ritual refers to the process of An-hyeon evolving into that class.”
