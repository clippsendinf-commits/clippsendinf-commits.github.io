# Chapter 5: Utilizing the Privileges

In Hall Plane, strength—more precisely, “User Information”—is the highest priority. It’s a world where all the information a person possesses, including their experience, disposition, stats, and abilities, is synthesized to determine their value.

That’s why I might be acting more sensitive than usual. I never expected to receive privileges, and crafting a perfect setup in such a short time was impossible. But I have ten years of experience to draw upon.

I wanted to survive. To survive, I needed strength. The desire to live soon turned into a yearning to pursue power. I endlessly pondered and researched which abilities to enhance and how to grow stronger. Reaching the rank of Master with a mere 48 points in Magic Power wasn’t something I achieved by mere chance.

I never imagined it would come to this, but the privileges I received were perfectly suited to applying the knowledge I’d accumulated.

The randomly selected Potential Abilities didn’t betray my expectations. As I read the names of the abilities that filled the two empty slots, I felt a wave of relief. Now, all that remained were one slot for a Unique Ability, one for a Special Ability, and two for Potential Abilities.

After much deliberation over my choices for Unique, Special, and Potential Abilities, I finally let out a sigh of relief.

“Phew. I’ve made my choices.”

“…”

At that moment, I felt a subtle gaze. There were only two of us in the Summoning Room, so I didn’t need to look to know who was watching me.

My final farewell with Seraph had been tender. But the resentment built up over ten years hadn’t fully dissipated. Moreover, now that I knew some of the inner workings, it was hard to view the angel before me favorably.

I deliberately avoided looking in Seraph’s direction. For a while, I kept my gaze averted, pretending to be distracted, but that could only last so long. Unable to withstand her uncomfortable stare, I decided to speak up.

“What are you looking at?”

I asked with a voice deliberately laced with irritation, but her gaze only grew more subtle. Seraph locked eyes with me briefly before speaking in a slightly flushed tone.

“User Kim Su-hyun’s stats and the Unique, Special, and Potential Abilities chosen from the privileges. After synthesizing these settings with those of the Sword Specialist, I came to a certain inference.”

“Who gave you permission to do that?”

“Your assistant, of course.”

Her quick retort left me feeling slightly dumbfounded. Was this angel joking? Or was she serious? Perhaps it was a bit of both, but I found myself nodding absentmindedly.

“Fine. What did you figure out?”

“I sensed a profound depth in your research on stats and abilities. It feels as though you’re a User who has experienced Hall Plane for a long time.”

“Haha. That’s ridiculous.”

A sharp pang hit my chest. I replied casually, masking my reaction, and Seraph slowly shook her head from side to side.

“It’s nothing.”

“I’ll admit I’m a bit of an unusual character.”

“It’s not about your behavior. The efficiency you’ve drawn out by utilizing your privileges far exceeds the angels’ expectations. Such choices could never come from someone who hasn’t directly experienced Hall Plane.”

“Hold on. Can I take it back?”

“No takebacks. As I’ve said repeatedly, you don’t need to worry about the privileges. Angels are different from humans. We don’t speak with two tongues. Anyway, I think I have a rough idea of what User Kim Su-hyun is aiming for. That’s all.”

Her voice carried genuine admiration, but her words were loaded with meaning. I couldn’t just revel in my pride with my heart still stinging.

Honestly, even though I’d done my research, my current goal was based on the class of one of the most renowned Users from the past.

Famous as he was, I remembered him even more vividly because we shared the same name: Sword Specialist Jin Su-hyun. That Secret Class was considered a nightmare by mages, showcasing unparalleled prowess in battles against them.

Jin Su-hyun entered Hall Plane about a year later than I did. Yet, through sheer effort, he closed that one-year gap in an instant. And with talent, he surpassed me in a flash. Considering the effort I’d put in myself, the sense of loss I felt back then still left a bitter ache in my chest.

Anyway, back to the point: it’s nearly impossible to perfectly replicate Jin Su-hyun’s information right now. For one, we weren’t exactly close, and he wasn’t the type of crazy User who’d share his details with others. Even if I inherited the essential elements, they’d only account for about 20% of the whole picture. The remaining 80% would have to be built from my own unique interpretation, fleshed out with the experience and expertise I’d gained over ten years.

“Stop looking at me like that.”

I openly showed my discomfort, and Seraph quietly closed her mouth.

*The Sword Specialist class is mine now.*

I wasn’t entirely without guilt, so I offered a brief prayer for Jin Su-hyun. *You’re talented enough to succeed with any other class, so don’t worry too much.* After finishing my not-quite-a-prayer, I turned my thoughts to the next privilege.

The fourth privilege.

*“4. You may undergo a single body modification procedure.”*

There wasn’t anything particularly special about a modification procedure. I’d seen cases where parts of the body were replaced with machinery or where beings from another dimension were deliberately summoned to replace parts of oneself. But those were only for cases where someone had completely lost a limb due to unavoidable circumstances. As someone with a healthy, intact body, I had no desire to give up any part of it. I could become strong without resorting to that.

What I had in mind was a tattoo procedure. This step was essential to completing my plan. Without the tattoo, the success rate of my plan would drop below 30%, making it dangerously uncertain. The item I intended to request for my fifth privilege was that powerful and risky.

Since I’d spent a considerable amount of time on the third privilege, I decided to request the tattoo procedure immediately.

“Hmm. Let’s see. Instead of some grandiose modification procedure, I’d like a simple tattoo.”

“That’s possible. I’ll bring up the tattoo list chart. Please wait a moment.”

“No need. I know the name. I’d like the Ancient Priestess’s Stigma tattoo, please.”

“Where would you like the tattoo to be placed?”

I calmly raised my right hand. As Seraph’s gaze followed it, I pointed with my finger to my left chest.

“My heart.”

“Your heart…?”

“What’s wrong?”

“…”

Seraph’s face remained serene. She said nothing. But I was certain her mind was racing with calculations at an unimaginable speed, trying to discern my intentions. I felt a pang of pity for her efforts, but I had no intention of revealing my plans yet.

Most tattoos are typically etched onto the skin. However, using ancient magic to inscribe a tattoo directly onto the heart via a mana imprint seemed to unsettle her.

The heart and its circuits are the core organs responsible for a User’s mana. Inscribing a tattoo on the heart, which could directly or indirectly affect mana reactions, carried inherent risks of unpredictable issues.

But the Ancient Priestess’s Stigma was different.

If I’d requested a typical tattoo, I’d likely have had to argue with Seraph for a while. Standard tattoos—those that amplify mana or affect its quantity—would have given her plenty of reasons to object.

However, the Ancient Priestess’s Stigma operates on a different level. It has two primary functions. First, it stabilizes mana if it goes out of control. Second, it helps guide the flow of mana efficiently.

Given these beneficial functions, Seraph was likely wrestling with her thoughts. I stared at her lips, feeling a slight tension. This procedure was the final key to ensuring the success of my highly uncertain plan. At last, her delicate lips parted slowly.

“Yes.”

Bingo.

“I will accept User Kim Su-hyun’s request. The procedure will take approximately 5 minutes and 7 seconds. I’ll begin immediately.”

“Okay.”

At that moment, ancient runes emitting a bright blue light appeared in the air before me, circling my body in an elliptical orbit. Simultaneously, I heard what seemed like the solemn voices of priestesses, though it might have been an auditory illusion.

Five minutes later, the runes circling me began to seep into my chest, one by one.

Even though it was my heart, there was no pain. Instead, with each rune that entered, I felt a slight surge of vitality. As the final rune sank in, the procedure concluded.

I couldn’t immediately sense what had changed. But I’d know soon enough by testing my mana. I began inspecting it right away.

*Oh.*

I had expected some difficulty managing the explosively increased mana, but I felt no strain at all. The mana flowed smoothly along my circuits. The procedure was a success. The unexpectedly satisfying performance brought a contented smile to my face.

“Not bad. Seraph? How much time is left?”

“You have 48 minutes and 39 seconds until the Rite of Passage.”

Forty-eight minutes and thirty-nine seconds. Seraph seemed to think there was plenty of time, given her lack of comment. But to me, it felt tight. The fifth privilege was a gamble, fraught with risk. It wasn’t something I could guarantee surviving, but its necessity made it unavoidable. I steeled my wavering resolve and recalled the fifth privilege.

*“5. User Kim Su-hyun may select one piece of equipment of their choice, with no restrictions on type. However, EX-rank equipment is not available.”*

In a way, this privilege offered a wide range of choices: swords, armor, elixirs, accessories, and so on. But choosing something ordinary would render the Ancient Priestess’s Stigma tattoo meaningless. The fifth privilege was something I absolutely needed.

“Hwajeong, the Essence of Fire. I’ll choose that for my fifth privilege.”

“I approve User Kim Su-hyun’s request…?”

Her tone rose oddly at the end, turning into a question. Seraph furrowed her brow slightly.

*Did she catch on?*

It was highly likely she’d figured out my intentions. Still, the approval process seemed to proceed normally, as a small, glowing red orb appeared in her right hand.

“…”

“…”

Neither of us spoke. But I could tell from her eyes—she had no intention of handing me the orb. As I suspected, Seraph’s expression turned stern, and she shot me a reproachful look. Not backing down, I hardened my own expression and met her gaze head-on.

“User Kim Su-hyun.”

“Tanay.”

“Of course. But this is a different matter. Even with Tanay, I can offer advice if it might harm you.”

“Advice? You mean interference. Stop the nonsense and hand it over. I need the Essence of Fire. Do you think I’d go through the trouble of getting the Ancient Priestess’s Stigma for no reason?”

This is why I couldn’t stand Seraph. She’d give it to me eventually, but not without a fight, leaving both of us emotionally drained. Memories of past arguments surged, and harsh words rose to the tip of my tongue. But then, the tender look in her eyes from our farewell flashed through my mind. Reflexively, I closed my mouth and listened. I figured I’d at least hear her out.

“I admire your creativity. For a human to come up with such an idea is truly remarkable. But that’s where it ends.”

“…”

“User Kim Su-hyun, how much do you know about the Essence of Fire?”

“That it can burn everything?”

“Close. Another name for the Essence of Fire is the Eternal Flame. The most destructive fire known is said to be Hell’s Inferno. But this pure aggregate of fire, Hwajeong, holds power comparable to it. This is a fire meant for destruction.”

“I know. I know all that, which is why I’m asking for it.”

“Durability stat: 92. Magic Power stat: 90. Estimated success rate: 21%. With the Ancient Priestess’s Stigma, the estimated success rate is 42%. In other words, there’s a 58% chance of failure.”

Seraph was desperately trying to persuade me. But no matter how hard she tried, the privilege was Tanay-grade. She could advise me, but she couldn’t block my decision. I stretched out my right hand confidently and demanded Hwajeong.

“If I succeed, that’s all that matters.”

It was a bold statement, even for me. Seraph was probably fuming inside. She’d explained at length, and I wasn’t budging. She was practically pleading now.

“Failure is one thing, but even success brings problems. If you fail, you lose everything and become a husk. Even if you succeed, there will undoubtedly be unforeseen drawbacks.”

“I’m pretty sure it said I could choose any equipment except EX-rank. Is Hwajeong EX-rank?”

“The Essence of Fire was originally EX-rank. It exists in Hall Plane but isn’t meant to appear. It was downgraded to S-rank for balance, but the danger remains…”

This could go on forever. Feeling exhausted, I raised my hand to stop her. I wanted to hear her out, but time was running out. A sudden thought hit me—she might be stalling to drag this into the Rite of Passage.

“I don’t want to argue anymore.”

“Even with Durability and Magic Power above 90, your Stamina is only 78. I understand your confidence, but please face reality.”

I knew what she was worried about. Her concern was warm enough to sway most people, at least a little. But I couldn’t afford to waver. I might compromise on other things, but this was non-negotiable. If I gave up on Hwajeong now…

“Recovery will take time. If you keep stalling, I’ll enter the Rite of Passage half-dead.”

“User Kim Su-hyun.”

“No more talk. I’m officially requesting the Essence of Fire.”

In the end, I snapped coldly. Whether she sensed the tense atmosphere or realized she couldn’t refuse a Tanay-grade privilege, Seraph slowly fidgeted with her fingers. Her face was still full of dissatisfaction, but she finally extended Hwajeong toward me. Not graciously, though.

“Even if you succeed, you’ll regret this one day.”

“Got it…”

*Whoosh.*

The Essence of Fire. A pure aggregate of flame. The Eternal Flame.

No preparation was needed. I’d made up my mind long ago, and considering the aftermath, time was short.

Hwajeong traced a thin crimson arc and slipped into my mouth.

*Gulp.*

I’d finally obtained Hwajeong. It was now truly in my possession. Suppressing the surge of relief and elation, I quickly turned my focus inward.

*Swallow.*

As my throat moved, I felt the round orb slide down my esophagus.

Now, the real challenge began.
