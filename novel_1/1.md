# Memorize - Episode 1 (1/1068): Zero Code, Rewinding 10 Years of Time

Nothing comes to mind. I simply roll the small bead in my left hand, feeling numb.  
“User Kim Su-hyeon.”  
Ten years. After that long, grueling time, I’ve finally achieved what I so desperately yearned for. Yet the emptiness doesn’t fade. The aching void filling my chest continues to torment me.  
“User Kim Su-hyeon, may I ask once more?”  
A low but beautiful voice brushes against my ears. Drawn by the sound, I slowly raise my head. As I do, the ash-gray brick floor comes into view. My gaze gradually takes in the thirty-pyeong room, until it stops.  
The “Summoning Room,” where everything begins and ends. At its center, on a rectangular altar, faint white wings shimmer with soft light. Feeling hollow, I fix my eyes on the “angel” seated there.  
“User Kim Su-hyeon, I will confirm your request once more. Do you truly wish to turn back the time of Hall Plane?”  
“Yes.”  
I nod slowly, staring at the angel before me. Her beauty, often called the pinnacle of perfection, her flawless skin, her faintly revealing attire—none of it stirs me. All of it is directed solely at me, yet I feel nothing.  
No desire sparks within me. Neither her breathtaking appearance nor her tender gaze can move my heart, which died long ago. Since *that day*, I’ve lost all emotion.  
“I cannot comprehend it. None of us angels can understand you.”  
“No, you’re wrong. I’m not seeking your understanding, Seraph.”  
My voice sounds cold, even to my own ears. Seraph’s tone, unlike her usual calm, trembles slightly. I’ve never seen her shaken like this, except today. Does that mean my words carry that much weight?  
Though she falters briefly, Seraph quickly regains her composed expression. With her gentle voice, she begins to reason with me.  
“User Kim Su-hyeon, you have completed all missions in Hall Plane and claimed the top as the first user to do so.”  
“And yet.”  
“No ‘and yet.’ You’ve obtained the Zero Code you so desperately desired. You have the *qualification*. Within the bounds of that qualification, you can achieve anything you wish.”  
“Seraph, this conversation is over.”  
“Return to Earth? Fine. You can go back with your current abilities intact. Stay in Hall Plane? That’s fine too. With the Zero Code, you could rule all continents as a king—or become something even greater.”  
She shows no sign of stopping, so I sigh and rest my right hand on my waist. The familiar grip of my sword feels comforting in my palm.  
“Phew, ten years of being swayed by sweet words is enough. I’m tired, Seraph. No matter what you say to tempt me, I won’t reconsider using the Zero Code.”  
I grip the hilt tightly and channel mana along its circuits. As energy surges through my body, Seraph falls silent, sensing it. But only for a moment. Soon, a look of pity crosses her face—she hasn’t given up on persuading me.  
“The Zero Code belongs solely to User Kim Su-hyeon. We have no authority to interfere. That’s why this is so regrettable. To use such immense power merely to turn back time is absurd.”  
“…”  
“For the last time, I will confirm: User Kim Su-hyeon, do you truly wish to repeat those ten painful years?”  
Her tone is almost pleading now. Suddenly, an inexplicable laugh bursts from within me—a laugh without reason.  
I laugh silently for a while.  

*  

This is not Earth. It’s a world called Hall Plane, where life is utterly unlike the daily routines of modern people—a place of extraordinary existence.  
I close my eyes tightly. I begin to trace back, step by step, everything I’ve experienced.  
When I first entered Hall Plane ten years ago, I was a hopeful 23-year-old. My last memory from Earth is of finishing two years of military service and heading home, elated.  
After reporting my discharge, I fell asleep on the train ride home. When I woke, I was in this very Summoning Room. Before my eyes stood an angel with shimmering white wings, a being I’d only imagined in stories.  
I knew nothing, understood nothing. For someone dreaming of returning home, it was like being struck by lightning.  
It wasn’t a dream or imagination. When I finally accepted it as reality, I begged the angel to send me back. But instead, I was sent to the “Rite of Passage,” a trial to prove my worth as a user. There, I was chased by monsters I’d never seen before, forced to undergo a grueling test.  
The trial lasted seven days—a battlefield where survival was the only goal. Amid countless threats to my life, I barely endured the week to earn the qualification of a “User” and enter Hall Plane.  
But the Rite of Passage was not the end. Hall Plane was the true beginning. If the Rite was a seven-day war for survival, Hall Plane was an endless hell where death could come at any moment.  
And so began my life in Hall Plane.  
I just wanted to survive. To adapt to this irrational world, I clung desperately to the angel’s promise that reaching the end would allow me to return. I poured ten years into that hope, fighting to survive and go back home—with the bonds I couldn’t bear to sever.  
“User Kim Su-hyeon, what are you thinking so deeply about? Have you perhaps…”  
The word “bonds” stirs a surge of emotion. I shake my head forcefully. Now isn’t the time to lose myself in memories.  
“Oh, just recalling the past. By the way, calling it a ‘painful ten-year repeat’… it seems you have at least a shred of conscience.”  
“…”  
“You’re right. Thanks to you angels, I endured pain I never should have—ten years of it.”  
“User Kim Su-hyeon.”  
As if trying to read my mind, Seraph’s gaze scans me. Before I can tell her to stop, her beautiful lips part, and a serene voice flows out.  
“If you’re thinking of User Kim Yu-hyeon and User Han So-yeong… I believe I understand what you desire. User Kim Su-hyeon, I have a very reasonable suggestion. With the GP you currently possess, you have enough points to activate multiple wishes. There’s no need to use the Zero Code to return to the past—”  
*He was right, even if I don’t want to admit it.*  
I knew she’d say that. Before she can finish, I draw my sword from its sheath and swing with all my strength.  
*Ping!*  
A sharp sound tears through the air. The wave I unleash shakes the altar where Seraph sits, but that’s all. Her pristine white barrier absorbs the attack, leaving no trace.  
“User Kim Su-hyeon… I understand your feelings, but this is futile. You likely know that already.”  
I know. Users cannot harm angels. Yet I swung my sword to declare my unyielding resolve.  
“Right before Astaroth died, he said you’re all just as bad as each other.”  
“You would believe the words of a demon? You, of all people?”  
“It’s the truth, isn’t it? This isn’t allowed, that isn’t allowed. In the end, there’s no real difference.”  
“Wait, let’s talk for a moment… I believe I’ve already explained enough about your request.”  
“No qualifications, you said. I don’t have the qualifications, so it’s not allowed. That’s why I’m going back in time—to reclaim those qualifications. So what’s your problem?”  
“Su-hyeon!”  
*Ping! Ping!*  
“Don’t shout, my ears are fine. And call me ‘User Kim Su-hyeon,’ like you always have.”  
Another wave flies and fades. Seraph stares at me with sad, disbelieving eyes. I don’t care. I tighten my grip on the sword, its blade gleaming with a fierce light. As I pour mana into it, blue flames begin to flicker along the blade. Seraph, staring at its tip, bites her lip.  
“This is my final warning. Put the sword away. You may be able to use settings, but your essence is human. Thinking you can kill a being of a far higher dimensional rank is a mistake.”  
“Oh? Shall we test that? I could abandon everything and ask the Zero Code for the authority to kill you all.”  
“You do hold the right to use it. But the Zero Code’s activation must go through us unconditionally. Abandon such futile dreams.”  
“You sound confident. Let’s see if there’s really no way.”  
“Su… User Kim Su-hyeon. This… this is a meaningless argument. Even so…”  
Seraph seems to want to say more, her lips trembling. But sensing the cold fury and resolve in my sword’s aura, she clamps her mouth shut.  
“…”  
“…”  
A heavy silence settles between us. I calm my boiling emotions and slowly lower my sword. With a lonely feeling, I hold up the Zero Code in my left hand. A small, beautiful bead glowing with deep blue light. To think something like this…  
“Seraph, I’m tired of fighting and talking. If you truly understand my feelings, if you genuinely care about me, I beg you.”  
The moment I say “beg,” Seraph’s sorrowful eyes widen. I extend the hand holding the Zero Code toward her. My resolve is now unshakable.  
“I’ll ask one more time. I want to go back ten years—to the time when I first arrived here.”  
Did she sense my earnest will? The Zero Code, glowing softly, begins to radiate a brilliant light. I calmly open my clenched hand. The orb, now shining with radiance, floats upward, tracing a gentle arc toward Seraph’s altar. She catches it with a dazed expression.  
Her empty gaze meets mine, intertwining in the air.  
How long did we stare at each other? Slowly, very slowly, her lips part.  
“If that is truly what you desire.”  
“…”  
“I will respect your decision.”  
“Seraph.”  
She looks at me with a weary expression before continuing.  
“Please don’t misunderstand. As I said, you currently hold a significant amount of GP. Erasing it entirely is not rational.”  
I shake my head side to side. What use are Gold Points if I’m going back? But Seraph seems to think differently, her hands moving at an invisible speed, as if manipulating something.  
“This is unbelievable, but your will has triggered a response from the Zero Code. Very well. As your assistant, I will adjust the details at my discretion. Rest assured, nothing will harm you, not even slightly. We will meet again soon after the process is complete.”  
Process complete? Meet again soon? Before I can ask what she’s scheming, as I open my mouth, an unfamiliar, resonant voice fills the Summoning Room.  
“Request received from User Kim Su-hyeon. 27%, 58%, 77%, 100%. Loading… Approved. Code Name: Zero execution initiated. Prepare yourselves.”  
*Creak, creak.*  
Suddenly, the sound of rusted machinery echoes from somewhere. At the same time, the Zero Code, nestled in Seraph’s arms, scatters clear light into the air.  
*Flash!*  
A blinding light fills the room, overwhelming my vision. The grinding machinery sound continues, and strange sensations sweep through my body. It’s not unfamiliar—the twisting of space, the feeling of something rushing past. It’s akin to the distorted sensation I felt during the Atlanta reclamation battle when the Grand Duke of Hell appeared.  
As the light grows stronger, Seraph’s form vanishes from view. Finally, I close my eyes tightly, surrendering to whatever comes next.
