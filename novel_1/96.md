# Memorize - Chapter 95: Can You Keep Up?

I sat on the cold marble floor, waiting for the others to finish their preparations. Naturally, I had offered to help with dismantling the campsite, but Yu-jeong and Sol vehemently opposed, relegating me to the role of a borrowed barley sack. Apparently, this was “women’s work” or some such nonsense. Yet, they had no qualms about bossing An-hyeon and Shin Sang-yong around. Thanks to them, I ended up with a rather leisurely preparation time.

I drew my sword and sat cross-legged, resting it across my knees. *Srrrng.* The sharp, chilling sound echoed through the room. The sword I was using was a standard iron blade purchased from a blacksmith in Mul after arriving here. As a swordsman, I knew all too well how to handle and maintain a blade.

Instinctively, I reached into my pocket. I had a habit of smoking while polishing my sword. But my hand found only a single cigarette—my last one. After a moment’s hesitation, I smacked my lips and pulled out a cloth instead. I decided to save the cigarette for after the expedition, before returning to the city.

The group’s movements were orderly, save for one exception. Everyone was busy folding their sleeping bags and cleaning up after breakfast. Jeong Ha-yeon was folding her sleeping bag with military precision, sharp enough to make a soldier weep. In contrast, An-hyeon was haphazardly stuffing his into a magic backpack, only to be caught and thoroughly scolded by An-sol.

I leisurely observed the scene while carefully wiping down the blade with the cloth.

“Leader, are we heading straight to the second floor today?” Shin Sang-yong asked.

I chuckled. “You’re stammering. Nervous, are we?”

“Haha, no, it’s just a habit,” he replied, laughing awkwardly, clearly embarrassed. “I’m not nervous at all.”

I nodded a couple of times at his jest, then gave the blade one final, firm wipe. “The plan is to head to the second floor.”

“G-good decision,” he stammered again.

“However…” I paused, lowering my gaze to the gleaming blade. Sliding the cloth back into my pocket and sheathing the sword, I heard that satisfying *srrrng* again. With a pleased smile, I continued, “We’ll ascend to the second floor and likely face the monsters born from their so-called ‘achievements.’ It’s said that a hundred humans can summon a single low-tier demon with their full strength intact. If we can gauge the quality of those hundred sacrifices, we can roughly estimate the rank of the summoned demon.”

“Brilliant,” Shin Sang-yong said. “If I may add, out of caution, the hundred used as sacrifices are supposedly the ones with the greatest achievements.”

“Thank you. I’ll keep that in mind.”

Yes, this was the kind of conversation a caravan’s members should have. I glanced at the others, hoping they’d take note and learn, but no one was paying attention to Shin Sang-yong and me. I sighed inwardly and turned to Vivian.

She was rubbing her eyes, looking sleepy. After an early dinner last night, she’d spent a while discussing records with Shin Sang-yong, mostly answering his questions, which seemed to have worn her out. Still, I knew she’d snap into action once combat began, so I didn’t say anything.

One by one, the group finished their preparations. Watching An-sol tightly fasten the straps of her backpack and sling it over her shoulders, I stood up, brushing off my clothes. With everyone’s eyes on me, I spoke in a calm voice.

“Good work, everyone. Though, we might have even tougher times ahead.”

Silence followed.

“But yesterday, we cleared the first floor of the laboratory. Today, our primary goal is to clear the second floor, with a secondary goal of reaching the third.”

Still no response. Noticing a hint of unease in An-sol’s eyes, I added one more thing. Before speaking, I deliberately gazed at the bright sunlight streaming through a window hanging high on the distant ceiling.

“We’re starting the expedition early this morning, so we have much more time than yesterday. If we can clear up to the third floor today, we’ll be able to return to Mul by tomorrow at the latest, triumphantly bearing the spoils we’ve gathered and will gather.”

Only then did I see a spark of enthusiasm in their eyes. Boosting morale like this, rather than rushing straight into the expedition, was one of a caravan leader’s duties. The kids, who had been looking at me with slightly bleary, sleep-laden eyes, now gazed with far brighter ones. I turned and continued, “There are two staircases: one to the north and one to the east. No need to go out of our way, so we’ll use the eastern staircase.”

With that, we headed toward the staircase leading to the second floor. As I placed my foot on the first step, the old stairs creaked as if they might collapse. The group carefully ascended, one cautious step at a time.

The staircase was longer than expected, spiraling upward. With each turn, the first floor’s floor grew increasingly distant. We climbed in silence for a while until we reached the door to the second floor. Just as I was about to open it—

“Su-hyeon, wait a moment,” Jeong Ha-yeon interjected.

I turned to her with a questioning look. She asked An-sol to cast a protective spell. Guessing her intent, I gave her a faint smile. Her meticulousness was shining through once again.

“Protect!” An-sol pointed her staff at me, and a translucent orb enveloped me. Watching this, Jeong Ha-yeon began chanting rapidly, forming hand seals with one hand. She was double-casting.

“Reflect Shield!” Her clear voice rang out, and before it faded, she spoke again. “Targeted protective spell: Overlap!”

As she finished, the Reflect Shield spell transformed into a fluid, jelly-like mass that merged with the protective orb around me. The orb began to shimmer with a faint golden light, drawing gasps from the group. I looked at Jeong Ha-yeon with admiration. I hadn’t expected her to be able to interfere with another’s spell. Though it was support magic, this was an exceptionally high-level application.

“Impressive,” I said.

“We’re standing on a staircase,” she replied modestly, with a gentle smile. “If a monster appears right at the door, it could be dangerous. This is just a precaution. It’s not that I doubt your skills, Su-hyeon.”

Her spell gave me a sort of obligation to enter the door before its effects wore off. The others didn’t say it, but their eyes gleamed with anticipation, hoping for monsters beyond the door.

“We’re now beginning the caravan’s second-floor expedition. Stay sharp, everyone. Let’s go in.”

I spoke calmly, then firmly turned the door’s handle and swung it open. As expected, no monstrous creature leapt out. There was only an empty space. As I took a step inside, I heard soft tongue-clicks from behind.

“Tch.”

“Chit.”

Those brats. Part of me wanted to pull down their pants and give them a good smack, but I suppressed the urge and led the group inside. As they followed, their attention was immediately captured by the sight before them. I quickly activated my Detection and Third Eye abilities.

“Ugh… I feel uneasy,” An-sol said, rubbing her arms and frowning. Her keen senses were picking up on something. The malice here was twice as strong as on the first floor, and I whistled inwardly. It seemed likely that the demon summoning had succeeded. Thinking about extracting a demon’s heart to process and feed to the group, I hummed softly, inaudible to the others.

The second floor was roughly the same size as the first but had an entirely different structure. The first floor had four corridors branching out in all directions, each lined with rooms. The second floor, however, was split in half, with one corridor connecting two large spaces. I scanned the area we were in. The layout was simple: a large, rectangular hall filled with piles of unidentifiable, weathered debris. Excluding the corridor, there was one door on each of the three remaining walls, making a total of three doors we could open.

“Hm. The structure’s different from the first floor,” Shin Sang-yong observed. “In a way, the second floor might be simpler.”

“On the surface, yes,” Jeong Ha-yeon replied. “But consider this: there are inherently fewer successes than failures. We can’t afford to let our guard down.”

Their voices carried as they chatted.

“Hyung, what’s the plan now?” An-hyeon asked.

“Hm?”

“Do we really need to open all these doors? Why not just head to the next area?”

“And how do you know the staircase to the third floor is in the other area?” I countered.

An-hyeon fell silent. Truthfully, I also suspected this area didn’t have a staircase. Still, I had a reason for wanting to explore every room: I wanted to make An-hyeon a Ki-Gong Spearmaster. Among the group, An-hyeon had the highest loyalty to me. An-sol’s feelings were harder to pin down—complex and subtle, even after my ten years of experience. Her actions sometimes defied simple explanations like affection.

Lost in thought, I must have looked dazed, because An-hyeon was staring at me. Snapping back, I said, “We might clear the second floor faster than expected. We’ll open all the doors in this area one by one, then move to the next space through the corridor.”

“Ugh, why’s there so much broken debris? It’s hard to walk,” Yu-jeong complained.

“Be careful. There might be bone fragments,” I warned.

“Oh no, that’s so scary!” she said with exaggerated cuteness.

The group visibly cringed at Yu-jeong’s antics. An-hyeon followed me without responding, his face filled with an odd sense of guilt toward the others. But my patience had its limits. Their repeated disruptions were starting to grate, so I shot them a sharp glare. An-hyeon and Yu-jeong instantly clammed up, and the atmosphere quieted. Maintaining the silence, I headed toward the door on the left wall, based on the direction we’d come from.

Though there were only three doors, each exuded an immense sense of foreboding. Even from a distance, they weren’t like the ordinary doors on the first floor. These were massive iron doors, studded with sharp spikes. We hurried toward our target, closing the distance.

Perhaps because we walked briskly, we reached the first door in about fifteen minutes. By then, the translucent golden orb around me, cast by An-sol and Jeong Ha-yeon, had faded. I scanned the surroundings before speaking in a low voice.

“I’m opening the door now. Everyone, get ready.”

“Hyung, that door looks too heavy,” An-hyeon said. “It might be tough to open alone.”

“No, I can handle it. Stay in formation.”

At my firm tone, An-hyeon stepped back, looking slightly surprised.

Since I was serious about facing the likely demon inside, I needed to rediscover my old ferocity. I was a bit worried whether the group could keep up, but I cleared my mind and reached for the oversized handle. Unsettling energies emanated from within the door.
