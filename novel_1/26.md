# Memorize - Chapter 25: The Trap City

“Of course, I’m against it. Compare the forest to this place, and the answer’s obvious, right? I’m not about to risk my life on some vague hunch of yours, oppa. I don’t think it’s worth leaving this city and facing the same dangers as yesterday.”

I had a faint hope, but as expected, it didn’t pan out. Lee Yu-jeong cast her vote against, making it one vote for and one against. My mouth felt a bit dry, but I decided to stay quiet and observe the outcome for now.

The next in line was Kim Han-byeol. If she voted in favor, there’d still be a glimmer of hope, so naturally, my attention shifted to her. She gazed at me steadily before speaking in her usual calm voice.

“I’m not exactly eager to leave either. But from what I’ve seen of him, I don’t think he has any bad intentions. He’s consistently made good decisions so far. There’s not enough evidence to fully prove what he’s saying, but I think there’s enough basis to consider it. I can’t choose between agreeing or disagreeing, so I’ll abstain.”

Kim Han-byeol chose to abstain. It was, in a way, the safest choice. Lee Yu-jeong seemed convinced we’d stay, her face beaming with a smug grin. I mentally prepared for the possibility of an unexpected outcome. Worst case, if a boss monster showed up, I’d just have to take it down. The tricky part would be doing it without getting caught.

The only ones left to vote were An-hyeon and An-sol. An-hyeon glanced at his sister, gently ruffling her hair before speaking.

“Sol-ah.”

“Yeah?”

“What do you want to do?”

At An-hyeon’s question, An-sol’s face took on a thoughtful expression. She fidgeted with her fingers, as if counting the votes so far. Then our eyes briefly met, and she flinched, her face turning red before she quickly looked away. She kept stealing glances at me, making me wonder if she was feeling unwell.

“Sol’s obviously against it, right? Right? It’s safe and comfortable here. If we go out, those scary monsters will come rushing at us—roar!” 

Lee Yu-jeong was now treating An-sol like a complete child. An-sol seemed to sense it too, puffing out her cheeks and pursing her lips as she shook her head at Yu-jeong’s exaggerated scare tactics. After another cautious glance at me, she spoke in a hesitant voice.

“I… I’m going to vote in favor of Su-hyeon oppa.”

Oh?

“Of course! You’re for it, right—wait, what? You’re *for* it?”

Lee Yu-jeong, who had been nodding enthusiastically, froze as she processed An-sol’s words. Her expression turned fierce, like she was ready to pounce. An-sol quickly ducked behind An-hyeon for cover. Both An-hyeon and Kim Han-byeol looked startled, their eyes wide as they stared at her. An-sol, clearly uncomfortable under their gazes, mumbled for a bit before slowly speaking again.

“Yes. I’m for it.”

“Why! Why on earth!”

“Hnng…”

An-hyeon fended off the now-fuming Yu-jeong and gently coaxed his frightened sister to explain her reasoning.

“Sol-ah, tell everyone why you’re voting in favor.”

“Um… well… it’s just a feeling. Like, I just have this hunch. Because…”

The moment she said “hunch,” An-hyeon’s expression shifted dramatically. It was brief, but I caught it clearly. What was going on?

“Hey! Making a decision based on a *feeling*? Are you serious—”

“Quiet!”

An-hyeon’s sudden sharp tone made Yu-jeong clamp her mouth shut. His face was deadly serious, his brow furrowed as he looked at An-sol. She didn’t seem to notice his intensity, nodding blankly before pointing a delicate finger at me.

“Before, it was just a vague feeling, but… last night, I had a dream about Su-hyeon oppa.”

“Everyone, please be quiet for a moment. Sol-ah, keep going. Tell us everything.”

“We were all sleeping in this room when a huge monster appeared. It was like something out of *Alien*. That monster came straight for our building… and it put everyone in danger. I thought we were all going to die—no, I’m sure I saw us die. But then the dream changed.”

“How did it change?”

“It was like rewinding a clock. The dream went back to the start, and suddenly Su-hyeon oppa appeared. The monster showed up again, but this time it was different. Su-hyeon oppa said he’d hold it off and told us all to escape. I was in oppa’s arms, frantically leaving the city, but just as I turned to look back, worried about him, the dream ended.”

“Do you remember anything else?”

“At the very end, I think I heard a horrible scream or roar… I’m not sure.”

We were all hanging on to her every word, listening with bated breath. For the first time since returning to the past, I looked at her with genuine interest. Honestly, I couldn’t fully wrap my head around it, even if it was outside my expertise.

Her ability stats were 75 Magic and 100 Luck. My own 96 Magic wasn’t just any number—it was enough to be considered top-tier among mages in the Hall Plane. Even with the power of the Third Eye, I could barely glimpse a single second of the past. Yet, she had vaguely seen the past and future through the power of a dream.

Of course, there was a clear difference between us. I could see actual past events and activate my ability at will. An-sol, on the other hand, couldn’t be certain if what she saw was real or influenced by something else, and her ability seemed to trigger randomly. Her near-perfect Luck stat likely made her premonitions uncannily accurate.

This also resolved one of my earlier questions. Back in my first cycle as a user, I never encountered this group. The reason was now clear: they must have come to this city for some reason and were likely killed by a boss monster after staying past two days. An-sol was probably the sole survivor back then.

“Haa…”

A deep sigh from An-hyeon echoed from the front. An-sol, having finished her story, was nervously glancing around. An-hyeon tapped his fingers on the floor, deep in thought, before addressing everyone with a troubled expression.

“I’m also in favor of Su-hyeon hyung’s suggestion.”

“What? Why you too? Didn’t you say you didn’t want to leave either? Are you just siding with your sister?”

Yu-jeong immediately jumped in with a scowl, but An-hyeon looked at her apologetically before responding.

“It’s not about taking sides. This might sound a bit funny, but…”

He glanced down at An-sol, nestled in his arms, and continued.

“I’ve lived with Sol for over nineteen years. We’ve been through a lot together, and one thing I’ve noticed is that she has an incredible sense of intuition.”

Of course. With 100 Luck, she’d likely have abilities like Intuition or Clairvoyance, which could even allow for glimpses of the future, assuming her rank supports it. As I mulled this over, Yu-jeong let out an exasperated sigh.

“Intuition, intuition, intuition. I’m sick of hearing about it.”

“It’s not a lie—it’s real. Whenever Sol feels uneasy, something bad always happens. Her dreams are rare, but… anyway, with three votes for, one against, and one abstention, we’re leaving. As we agreed, everyone should follow the majority. Let’s get up and move now.”

“Right now?”

“After a dream like that, the sooner we leave, the better. Everyone, grab only the essentials.”

He turned to me. “Hyung, keep watch just in case. Call us when you’re ready.”

“Alright. I’ll do that. Let me know when you’re done.”

Seeing this new side of An-hyeon compared to yesterday, I gave a satisfied smile. After equipping my crossbow on my left arm, I stood up, brushing off my seat.

---

It was subtle, but An-hyeon had definitely changed. He’d gone out to patrol alone this morning, and now he was showing an almost unnatural level of initiative. Of course, a few words from our talk yesterday couldn’t have completely transformed his mindset. Still, seeing him at least outwardly shift his attitude suggested he was trying to do as much as he could. It was a positive change, and I hummed softly as I scanned our surroundings.

As An-hyeon said, leaving now was the best choice. Dawdling and setting out in the afternoon only to wander at night was something to avoid at all costs. Starting in the morning and finding a place to rest by the afternoon was far better. I could hear bustling noises from downstairs—seems they were planning to take as much as they could carry.

Breathing in the still-chilly air, I felt my mind clear. If it had just been people like Park Dong-geol, Lee Bo-rim, or Lee Sin-u, they’d probably have thrown a fit about staying. Things had worked out surprisingly well. This is why it’s easier to travel with capable users. I silently offered a moment of respect for Park Dong-geol’s group.

Physically, we’d survived the forest’s interior and outskirts, considered the toughest part of the Rite of Passage. Psychologically, we’d overcome the trap point in this city. Now, if we could avoid a boss monster or other survivors—both of which had a random chance of appearing—the path to the central gate would be relatively easy. The other monsters that might appear…

“Hey…”

I was just thinking about the monsters we might encounter closer to the center when someone called out to me. Turning, I saw Kim Han-byeol standing there, a small backpack slung over her shoulder, looking like she was nearly ready.

“Yes. Are you all set?”

“I’m done. The others are still packing.”

“Got it. I’ll keep watch a bit longer then.”

“…Can we talk for a moment?”

Her sudden request caught me off guard, but I nodded. “Sure, anytime.”

She approached me cautiously, her expression hesitant. I wondered what she wanted to say. After a moment of sizing me up, she spoke in a careful tone.

“Have you… heard anything about me from Yu-jeong unni or An-hyeon oppa?”

“About you and Yu-jeong fighting?”

“That, and… maybe something else?”

I shook my head. I hadn’t heard anything specific about her.

“I see. Well…”

Her story wasn’t a big deal. She explained that when Yu-jeong insisted on going out, she’d opposed it. Honestly, when she mentioned saying, “The living should live,” I gave a wry smile, but I knew it wasn’t her true feelings, so I let it slide. Getting upset now would just make me seem petty, and it was better to take it in stride. Things like this were common in the Hall Plane, so it didn’t bother me much.

“…I’m sorry. I was just so upset at the time. If you put yourself in my shoes, you’d understand how frustrating it must’ve been…”

It was the first time I’d heard her usually calm voice sound so subdued. Her relationship with Yu-jeong still seemed strained, but that wasn’t something I could easily meddle in. I gave her a slight smile and responded.

“No, it’s not frustrating. Honestly, I think you did the right thing.”

“…”

“I mean it. You made a level-headed judgment. If we’d gone out as is, like you said, we wouldn’t have found me, and Yu-jeong or An-hyeon would’ve been in serious trouble—probably dead. It’s not something you need to apologize for.”

“Still…”

“I was a bit worried about Yu-jeong being so hot-headed, but having you there to balance things out was a relief. If it happens again, do the same. I actually prefer it that way.”

“…Thank you.”

As we finished speaking, our eyes met. For the first time, I saw her smile—brief, fleeting, but undeniably beautiful.

For a moment, *she* from the Hall Plane flashed through my mind.
