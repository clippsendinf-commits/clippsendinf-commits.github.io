# Memorize - Chapter 135: A Meaningful Conclusion

“Hmm. Hmhmm. Hmm. Hmhmm.”

The next morning, the group sat huddled around the table, waiting for breakfast. Usually, they’d be chatting away about this and that, but today, everyone was unusually silent. Their eyes were fixed on Go Yeon-ju, watching her with curious, puzzled looks.

Unfazed by their stares, Go Yeon-ju busied herself bringing out the food, humming cheerfully.

“Hmhmm. Hmm. Hmhmm. Hmm.”

A bright smile spread across her face as she continued her tune. I had a hunch about why she was in such high spirits, so I pretended not to notice and looked away.

“Breakfast is served~,” she announced in a voice twice as gentle as usual, setting the dishes on the table. As the delicious spread she prepared appeared one by one, the group let out gasps of admiration. The meal Go Yeon-ju presented today was on an entirely different level from the norm.

Typically, our breakfast was the A-course menu: bread, soup, stew—a modest yet satisfying selection. I always ordered the A-course for breakfast. Too heavy a meal could weigh us down, making the start of the day sluggish. But today’s spread was lavish, almost extravagant, surpassing even the C-course in its grandeur. When a steaming, perfectly cooked steak was set down, Shin Sang-yong, with an awkward smile, spoke up.

“User Go Yeon-ju, you seem in high spirits today.”

“Oh? Do I? Hmhmm. Hmm.”

“To make all this on your own—impressive. Thanks to you, we’re in for a real feast this morning. Haha.”

“Hoho. It’s not every day you get a spread like this. Especially the gentlemen—eat up! I’ve packed in plenty of ingredients to boost your stamina. Who knows, it might help you make some progress later, right?”

“Ahem. Such bold words… Progress, you say? What do you mean by—”

“Hmm.”

Shin Sang-yong scratched his head, looking a bit flustered by Go Yeon-ju’s playful banter. I let out a small cough, and she winked at me before taking a seat. My mind drifted to the kiss we shared last night. The first thing that came to mind was the warmth and softness of her lips. I touched my own lips briefly before picking up my spoon. (As a side note, I’d never managed to break the group’s habit of waiting for me to start eating before they picked up their utensils.)

Just as I was about to take a spoonful of soup, the sound of footsteps descending the stairs echoed through the room.

*Tap… Tap… Tap… Tap…*

The moment I heard those steps, a faint smile crossed my face. Listening closely, there was a deliberate pause between each step, unlike the hurried stomping of the past. It was a sign of newfound composure. Even after I’d given her time to think, it seemed Yu-jeong had grabbed Skrep right after I left.

The group, hearing the footsteps, turned their attention to the staircase. As expected, it was Lee Yu-jeong descending.

She appeared last, her face carrying a languid air. The usual sharpness in her eyes had softened, and her hair seemed to shimmer with a faint reddish glow. I caught myself smiling secretly as I watched her. It was as if she’d made a bold decision, unwilling to stay still any longer. When I glanced at Go Yeon-ju, her eyes sparkled with surprise and intrigue.

Yu-jeong approached the table, scanning the group before quietly taking an empty seat. The others, sensing a shift in her demeanor, looked at her with unfamiliar expressions. If the old Yu-jeong was a tomboyish firecracker, the current Yu-jeong exuded a dreamy, almost seductive femininity.

After a moment, An-sol, cautiously gauging Yu-jeong’s mood, spoke up hesitantly.

“Um, unni. Good morning.”

“Yeah, morning. Did you sleep well?”

“Y-Yes…”

Yu-jeong replied in a calm, serene tone. Typically, wielding a magic sword like Skrep doesn’t drastically alter one’s personality, but in rare cases, it can. And it seemed Yu-jeong was showing signs of such a change. Could it be that Skrep had truly accepted her as its user?

An-sol tilted her head, clearly puzzled by Yu-jeong’s response. It wasn’t that her behavior was unusual for a female user, but given Yu-jeong’s usual demeanor, it felt jarring. An-hyeon seemed equally baffled. After staring at her blankly for a moment, he spoke in a forced, teasing tone.

“Well, look at you! Showing up on time for once. Not sulking like a kid anymore, huh? Feeling better now?”

“Hey.”

“Huh? What? What’s up?”

Yu-jeong cut him off mid-sentence, fixing him with a steady glare. An-hyeon flinched under her gaze. Something was definitely different, but he couldn’t quite pinpoint what. One thing was clear: the old Yu-jeong would’ve snapped back with a curse, but now she was choosing her words carefully. That alone made the group feel a subtle awkwardness.

After a pause, Yu-jeong spoke slowly.

“How about you stop running your mouth and eat? Don’t ruin the mood first thing in the morning.”

“What? What did you say?”

“Oppa, you got your spoon ready?”

An-hyeon sputtered, caught off guard, but Yu-jeong ignored him and turned to me. I gave a wry smile and nodded.

“Yeah. You should eat too.”

“Got it. Wow, what a feast today. Looks delicious. You enjoy it too, oppa.”

“Alright, alright. Let’s all dig in.”

I addressed the still-stunned group, then cut a piece of steak and popped it into my mouth. The tender, juicy texture filled my senses, and I felt a wave of satisfaction. Those two must have had quite the conversation last night.

I’d had my doubts, to be honest. Even with my presence, Skrep was a magic sword, and I worried it might twist Yu-jeong in strange ways. But as if mocking my concerns, their compatibility seemed far better than I’d imagined. Of course, only time would tell how things would unfold, but the start was promising.

“Oppa, try this.”

Yu-jeong placed a neatly cut piece of meat on my plate, and I smiled contentedly.

*

“Hehe. So full. So happy.”

“I think I ate too much this morning, Master.”

“It’s fine, it’s fine~.”

Vivian patted her slightly rounded belly, beaming with a blissful smile. Oh, how tempting it was to tease her—no, never mind. Beside her, Shin Sang-yong chuckled and sipped his tea.

Four of us, including me, remained at the table. After breakfast, the group usually followed my orders and dispersed, but today, a few lingered. The user I appreciated most was, without a doubt, Ha-yeon. As soon as breakfast ended, she dragged An-sol upstairs, as always. She must have noticed Yu-jeong’s change but deemed it positive, choosing not to question it further. It was a rational judgment, typical of Ha-yeon.

Go Yeon-ju, meanwhile, began clearing the table as if it were second nature. As she carried some dishes to the kitchen, Yu-jeong, lost in thought, picked up her own dishes and followed. The group gaped in surprise, but I kept a neutral expression.

Yu-jeong didn’t return from the kitchen, and I had no idea what was happening in there. (Not that I couldn’t find out if I wanted to, but I chose not to.) I did catch a glimpse of her face as she entered, and her eyes held that same faint reddish glow. The progress was faster than I’d expected. When Go Yeon-ju returned for the remaining dishes, her smile was noticeably brighter.

Some of the group tried to question her, curiosity getting the better of them, but I raised my hand each time to silence them. Since things had come to this, I decided to let Go Yeon-ju have her fun.

“Ugh… I don’t get what’s going on. Hyung, why’s Yu-jeong acting like that all of a sudden?”

An-hyeon, who’d been tilting his head in confusion, finally scratched his scalp and grumbled. Vivian, yawning widely, responded lazily.

“Yawn~ Nom nom. Delicious. Who cares? She seems to have changed for the better. Isn’t that good enough?”

“I guess, but… ugh. You wouldn’t get it. I’ve known her since the beginning, and today’s the first time she’s ever felt… feminine. It’s so awkward I could die. Argh!”

*Sip.* I took a sip of tea, observing them. It was about time to wrap things up. Yu-jeong could come back any moment, and we couldn’t sit here forever.

“An-hyeon, you don’t have time to be lounging around like this.”

I spoke calmly, looking at him. He snapped his head up, swallowing hard before replying.

“Huh, hyung? What do you mean, no time?”

“You know why Yu-jeong followed Go Yeon-ju, right?”

“Well, yeah… probably because of that thing you asked her to do. Should’ve just done it from the start. She made the mood all weird for nothing and ended up begging. Tsk tsk.”

An-hyeon shook his head, his tone laced with the pride of a Ki-Gong Spearmaster. Confidence is good, but too much can breed arrogance, and arrogance leads to carelessness—a fatal flaw. It seemed An-hyeon needed a little wake-up call.

“Heh. The point is, Yu-jeong’s driven enough to act like this. Go Yeon-ju is a widely recognized skilled user. Plus, I gave Yu-jeong a powerful weapon last night. You’d better step up. Keep slacking off, and she’ll catch up to you in no time.”

An-hyeon’s expression shifted from nonchalant to serious as I spoke. At the mention of a “powerful weapon,” he looked at me with a mix of indignation and grievance.

“Hyung, that’s not fair. Why’re you favoring Yu-jeong?”

“…What? You’ve got a spear and a rare class, and that’s what you say?”

“Oh, right, I might’ve gone overboard. But now you’ve got me worried. I thought I was working hard, but I guess I need to push even more.”

“Not a bad idea. Rest is important, but as a zero-year user, no amount of training is too much. You’ve got the record book as a guide, too.”

“Oh! I finished reading the translated version yesterday. Perfect timing. Vivian?”

“Hmph.”

An-hyeon called out to Vivian, who immediately pouted. She was clearly enjoying her post-meal satisfaction and didn’t appreciate the interruption. An-hyeon glanced at me, and I fixed Vivian with a steady look. Under my gaze, she stuck out her lip but reluctantly stood. Shin Sang-yong followed suit.

I gathered the teacups as I spoke.

“Leave the cups; I’ll take them to the kitchen. We’ll have a meeting soon about our next objective. Even though it’s a preparation period, don’t get too relaxed. Have a productive day, everyone.”

“Yes, hyung.”

“Yes, Leader. We’ll work hard.”

An-hyeon and Shin Sang-yong responded energetically, but Vivian only nodded glumly, probably thinking I was talking about her. After sending them off, I carried the teacups to the kitchen.

“Hmm. It’s got a certain charm.”

Muttering to myself, I surveyed the kitchen. It was my first time in Go Yeon-ju’s domain. Dirty dishes were still piled up, unwashed. I figured I’d just set the cups on top and let her handle it. But as I was about to place them down—

*Bang!*

“Urk!”

There was a door in the kitchen, one I knew led to Go Yeon-ju’s living quarters. A loud crash came from within. My gut told me Yu-jeong and Go Yeon-ju had already started training.

“Get up right now. Do I look like Kim Su-hyeon to you? You’ve got one second.”

“Ughhh… Haaah!”

“I told you not to swing so wildly!”

*Thud! Bang!*

“*Cough!* Urgh, ughhh!”

“…”

Go Yeon-ju’s voice and Yu-jeong’s pained screams rang out together, followed by the sound of retching. The noises of someone hitting and being hit were just background at this point. I’d asked her to train Yu-jeong, but I hadn’t expected *this* approach. I felt a twinge of unease at the brutal method. Still, the thought crossed my mind that Go Yeon-ju was teaching with her own kind of passion. And as one of the Ten Strongest, it felt absurd to meddle in her methods. After a moment of hesitation, I decided to stick to my initial trust.

I stared at the door for a moment, listening to the sounds, then quietly set down the teacups and left the kitchen.
