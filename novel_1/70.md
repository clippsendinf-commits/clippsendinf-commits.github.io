# Memorize - Chapter 69 (69/1068): Vivian la Clarté

Vivian had transformed from a human into a spider. To undergo such a process, either physical modification or infection was necessary, both of which inevitably required a catalyst known as the "Core." The Core could be any substance imbued with mana, with the most common being a mana stone. One might think of it as just a mana stone, but Vivian’s case was far from ordinary.

The mana stone within her body, over time, became a singular core integral to her being. In human terms, it could be likened to a heart or the central hub of magical power. It was a conduit for mana, a nexus where countless streams of magical energy flowed daily. After a long period, the mana stone, having become the Core, transformed into a kind of inner elixir, retaining deep reserves of mana.

Of course, it wasn’t comparable to the divine elixir of a mythical beast or the spiritual core of a sacred creature. But it was better than nothing, and one could never be certain of its true potential. I deliberately put on a serious, contemplative expression.

“Hmm. It’s a bit lacking.”

“What? Come on, give me a break. This is really all I’ve got!”

“Really?”

“Yup, yup. Really, really.”

“For real?”

As I pressed her repeatedly, Vivian’s face twisted with indignation, and she let out a sharp yell.

“Ugh! This is so frustrating! I’m telling you, it’s true! If you don’t believe me, check for yourself!”

“I want *that*.”

I slowly raised my finger, pointing at her body. Vivian followed my gesture, then turned her head to look down at herself. Her expression shifted to one of disbelief as she stared at me and opened her mouth.

“Human male, I’ve got a question. Do you have some kind of weird fetish?”

“Fetish?”

“Yeah, like, you know… mating with spiders or something…”

“Shut up.”

“Eek! Sorry!”

I cut her off sharply. What kind of nonsense was she spouting? Seeing my stern expression, Vivian immediately lowered her eyes, trembling slightly. I watched her for a moment, then deliberately twirled my sword in my hand. The more I did, the more intensely she shook. For some reason, her trembling made me want to tease her even more. Still, considering the situation, I spoke calmly.

“I don’t mean I want to sleep with you. I want what’s *inside* you.”

“Inside me…? There’s nothing useful in there. Want some silk or something?”

“No, no. That’s not what I mean. You were human before, right?”

“Yup.”

Vivian nodded readily, and I felt a pang of guilt for bringing it up. But I steeled myself and continued.

“If you transformed into a spider, there must be a mana-infused substance that acted as the catalyst.”

“Oh, I see. You’re pretty knowledgeable… Wait. You mean the Core?”

“Exactly.”

“You’re asking me to hand over my Core? Are you insane?”

As expected, she either remembered or was well aware of it, perhaps because she had researched and applied it to herself. Her eyes widened as she questioned me. I nodded firmly. Seeing my confirmation, her face went blank for a moment before she let out a sharp “Hah!” and continued, her voice laced with incredulity.

“No way. You’re joking, right?”

“Not joking.”

“Come on, I can tell you’re messing with me! Heh… haha.”

“I’m serious. Hand over the Core. Give me that and the other stuff, and I’ll let you live. Promise.”

I held up my pinky finger. Vivian’s face crumpled. She took a step back, her voice rising in a shrill shout.

“Are you crazy? Why would I give you that?!”

“Don’t worry. You won’t die from having it removed.”

“I know that! Would *you* give up your heart or your magical circuits if someone asked? Make some sense!”

“Of course, I wouldn’t. But give it to me anyway.”

“Why are you so sneaky about it?! No way!”

“Give it.”

“Just kill me! I’d rather die than hand it over! If I give it up, I’m as good as—”

“Alright then. Shame.”

I raised my sword and took a step forward. Vivian flinched, visibly shuddering, and quickly scrambled back. But we were inside her workshop; there was no escape. She seemed to notice the passageway behind me, and in a desperate tone, she spoke rapidly.

“Wait! Hold on! Put the sword away! Let’s talk. Talk! Hey, stop coming closer!”

Being the kind soul I am, I complied with her request. I stopped walking and reiterated my demand in a clear, steady voice.

“Let me say it again. Give me the stuff you’ve got and the Core inside you. That’ll cover the price of your life.”

“That’s ridiculous—”

“Negotiation’s over.”

Unable to reason with me, Vivian finally let out her pent-up frustration.

“You heartless, bloodless bastard!!!”

“Oh? Showing your true colors now, huh? Whatever. This is getting annoying. Maybe I’ll just kill you and take it myself. Might as well dissect your body while I’m at it…”

Humming a tune, I started walking toward her again. Vivian stared at me, her face a mix of outrage, fear, and disbelief. I could almost see the thought *“I wish he’d just cry already”* cross my mind. Wait, why am I acting like this? Am I actually going crazy?

Shaking off the stray thoughts, I focused and channeled mana. A brilliant sword aura flared along my blade, and my expression grew cold. Reading the change in my demeanor, Vivian frantically looked around for an escape route, but it was futile. The workshop was already thick with my killing intent.

Still clinging to hope, she tried to climb the wall to flee. I moved like lightning, closing the distance and swinging my sword. It cut through her like soft tofu, severing one of her legs, which rolled across the floor. Vivian screamed in agony, collapsing and writhing on the ground. Unfazed, I raised my sword above her head.

“Goodbye. You were pretty entertaining, at least.”

“Nooo! Wait! Hold ooon!”

“Hm? What’s that? I’ll hear your last words.”

Vivian, who had been screaming with her eyes squeezed shut, cracked them open at my words. Seeing that I’d paused, she let out a brief sigh of relief, but her eyes soon trembled as she realized her predicament. Oh, she’s about to cry… Damn it.

Looking into my eyes, she seemed to finally grasp that I was serious. Her small lips parted.

“…I’ll give it to you.”

“What was that? Louder.”

“I said I’ll give it! Just don’t kill me, you bastard! Waaah!”

Unable to hold back her sorrow, Vivian burst into tears. I gave a slight smile. She’s kind of cute when she cries. I wonder what she looked like as a human. Grinning, I lowered my raised sword.

“Good choice. Haha.”

“Waaah! Oh no, oh nooo! Waaah! Boo-hoo!”

I went through the effort of helping the spider back to her feet. She accepted my assistance meekly, but her sobbing didn’t stop. If anything, she cried harder, stamping her remaining legs on the ground. I scratched my head, watching her. Did I really treat her *that* harshly? Seeing her weep so profusely, with tears and snot streaming down, I felt a bit of pity. Her three severed legs left her unable to stand properly, tilting to one side, which made me feel even guiltier.

“Waaah! Sob, sob, waaah!”

“Hey, quiet down.”

My words came out contrary to my thoughts. Still, my stern tone worked, and Vivian clamped her mouth shut. But she couldn’t stop the hiccups, her shoulders (or what I assumed were shoulders) shaking as tears and snot continued to flow. Even so, she kept sending me pleading looks, as if saying, *“Really? You’re really taking it?”* After a moment of waiting, I spoke with an irritated expression.

“Are you stalling? If you’re going to give it, hurry up. Or should I just cut it out myself?”

“Fine, damn it! I’ll give it to you… Waaah.”

Unable to contain her grief at my unwavering resolve, Vivian sobbed again, her abdomen bulging as she prepared to expel the inner elixir. Once, twice, three times—her abdomen swelled repeatedly. Finally, with a despairing look, she stared at me. I quietly raised my sword.

“Here! Take it! *Hic*! You damn jerk! Waaah!”

I shrugged off her curses as a response. With a final push, Vivian’s mouth released a gush of fluid along with a black, round orb. It was surprisingly large, about the size of an adult’s palm, likely having been nurtured for a long time. I quickly checked its information.

『You have acquired Alchemist Vivian’s Core.』

Having expelled the inner elixir, Vivian collapsed, her face blank with exhaustion. Tears rolled down her cheeks onto the floor. Satisfied, I reached for the orb. Then, her faint voice reached my ears.

“Sob… It’s poisoned. *Hic*! If you touch it, you’ll die.”

Even now, she’s worried about me? This girl is hilarious. Chuckling, I picked up the orb without hesitation. Vivian’s face twisted oddly, then shifted to a mix of concern and anticipation as she watched me. Wanting to tease her further, I grabbed my hand and shouted.

“Gah! The poison’s getting me! Argh, I’m dying!”

“What?! I told you— Wait, no, that’s not right. Yes! Serves you right!”

I summoned Hwajeong to my hand and infused it with my will. The intent I channeled was to purge the <Poison> within the orb. As my mana-filled hand enveloped it, the orb’s color began to change. Initially pitch black, it gradually returned to its original blue hue.

This was the advantage of a Mythical-grade ability. A Flame-grade ability would simply burn it, but a Mythical-grade Hwajeong could be controlled precisely according to the user’s will. Vivian watched the process with a fascinated expression. When I finished and tucked the orb into my pocket, she stared at me dumbfounded. I grinned and said, “Just kidding.” Her lips pursed, and she burst into tears again. I chuckled at the sight.

After the commotion settled, Vivian sat limply on the ground, her face drained. I spoke to her, having already collected all the items she’d offered.

“Congratulations. As promised, I’ll let you live. Haha. Don’t think too badly of me. By the way, a piece of advice: you should leave this dungeon as soon as possible. It’ll be exposed soon, and the city’s inspection team will come investigating.”

“I don’t care!”

“You’ll die if you stay here.”

“Without my Core, I’ve lost most of my power anyway! It’s the same whether I stay or go! I’ll die either way— Urgh!”

Vivian, who had been ranting with a defiant expression, suddenly grimaced in pain. The loss of her Core seemed to be disrupting her internal balance.

“Urgh… It hurts… It hurts!”

She appealed to me, but there was little I could do. If anything, I could only offer to end her suffering. Pointing to my sword with a nonchalant expression, I watched as Vivian turned away, her face trembling with betrayal.

“You jerk… Sob… I gave you my body and my heart… Urgh… Argh!”

“What nonsense.”

I snorted and observed her. What followed left me slightly stunned. Vivian’s body began to twist unnaturally, her remaining legs detaching one by one. Like a disassembling robot, her body contorted and broke apart. My eyes lit up with intrigue. Could this phenomenon be…?
