# 메모라이즈-64화 (64/1068) Mage and Alchemist (Rare) (2)

“Hyung.”

An-hyeon’s voice snapped me back to attention. I quickly turned my gaze to find the kids staring at me with uneasy expressions. We were already surrounded by spiders that had crept in, forming a tight circle. Though we had secured an escape route, I had a gut feeling these monsters would be the toughest we’d faced so far.

The kids, too, seemed to sense that these spiders were different from the monsters we’d encountered before, their faces clouded with anxiety. If I showed even a hint of nervousness now, it would only amplify their unease. To calm them, I quickly put on a composed expression and spoke in a steady voice.

“Let’s focus on dealing with the spiders for now.”

“What about that woman…?” 

An-sol’s voice trailed off with a hint of pity, but I shook my head firmly. I had already judged her situation as hopeless, and our survival took priority. Seeing An-hyeon and Yu-jeong grip their weapons, I raised my voice further.

“Forget the user hanging up there. It seems the dungeon’s master has been toying with her. From now on, our goal isn’t rescuing users—it’s exploring the dungeon and surviving. They’re coming. Everyone, get ready.”

If we could just get through this hurdle, we might finally see the end of this wretched dungeon. With that thought, I hurriedly drew my sword, vowing to give the alchemist a good thrashing if we met. I continued, “We’ve secured the escape route, so hold a defensive formation. There are quite a few spiders, but their size means they can’t all rush us at once. Watch out for the ones sneaking in from blind spots to spray venom—I’ll handle those. Focus only on the ones in front of you.”

*Skrrt. Skrrrt.*

As soon as I finished speaking, the spiders began closing the distance, their legs scraping against the floor. The closer they got, the more grotesque they appeared. If I felt this way, I could only imagine how An-sol and Yu-jeong were holding up. As the spiders drew nearer, the two girls looked on the verge of fainting, but when they saw the green orbs continuously falling from above, their expressions turned venomous. They were clearly furious at what had been done to a fellow female user.

Soon, white threads shot out from the mouths of the spiders in front. The battle to cross the final ridge of this dungeon exploration had begun.

---

“Cure!”

A warm sensation enveloped my body as An-sol’s hands, glowing with white light, touched me. Even though I insisted I was fine, she clung to me, pouring healing magic into me with no way to stop her.

“Guys, you can rest now. I’m okay.”

“But still…” 

“Come on, you need to rest too.”

Here’s how it unfolded. We fought a grueling battle and barely managed to gain the upper hand. My battlefield coordination and support made it possible. Just as I was about to finish off a struggling spider, a torrent of venom sprayed from its mouth.

I quickly pushed the kids out of the way, taking the brunt of the venom myself. With Hwa-jeong inside me, most poisons would be burned away, and my high endurance stat meant I was unlikely to take damage from mere spider venom. But the kids made such a fuss that I ended up letting them heal me. Of course, my brief stumble might have played a part in their overreaction.

Only after I nearly snapped at them did they back off and take a break. Looking around, they were practically sprawled out on the ground. Yu-jeong lay flat, staring at the ceiling. An-hyeon stretched his legs out, gazing upward as well. An-sol, her face pale, sat quietly, also looking at the ceiling. Guessing why they were acting this way, I let out a soft sigh and began to consider what to do about the female user.

I looked up at her. Her belly was still swollen, but no more spider eggs were falling. Occasional grimaces and faint moans confirmed she was alive, but that was all. From her perspective, being alive might not feel like living at all.

“It’s… hard to believe. Did we really take down all these spiders?” 

An-hyeon surveyed the surroundings, shaking his head in disbelief. He started brushing off the spider webs clinging to him but soon gave up, collapsing onto the ground as if his body weighed a ton. His arms moved sluggishly, as if even that was exhausting.

Yu-jeong’s body was covered in small cuts, her clothes torn, revealing glimpses of flushed skin. When I stared blankly, she tugged her collar down slightly and winked at me provocatively. But when I gave her a stern look, she quickly lowered her gaze. That cheeky girl.

After a moment, I gave up and sat down as well. The kids’ worried glances gathered on me, but I waved them off to signal I was fine. Forcing them to get up now, when they were this exhausted, might spark a rebellion—especially from Yu-jeong. She was sprawled on the ground, and as the tension left her, her senses seemed to return. She groaned, calling out to An-sol desperately.

“Ugh… I think I’m poisoned… My whole body aches… An-sol, cast a detox spell on me, please.”

“Just a moment…” 

“You cast it for Su-hyeon oppa right away! Are you playing favorites?” 

Yu-jeong’s sharp words made An-sol’s face flush red as she frantically waved her hands.

“No, it’s not that… I’m completely drained right now…”

By “drained,” she meant mana exhaustion. Overusing magic now could cause a backlash. Yu-jeong nodded in understanding and lay back down. An-hyeon, who had been staring at the ceiling with a tired expression, turned to me with a weary face.

“Hyung…”

“What?”

“What are we going to do about that female user?”

I paused, choosing my words carefully. An-hyeon had been fixated on her since before the battle. I couldn’t understand why he cared so much. Was it because she was a woman? She was fairly elegant and pretty, but in her current state… I decided to probe him a bit.

“What do you think?”

“I want to save her.”

His immediate, unwavering response made me smile faintly. An-hyeon’s alignment was True Neutral, leaning toward balance. His genuine desire to save her suggested a potential shift toward order or good. I wanted to give him an encouraging answer, but I wasn’t one for false hope.

“I don’t know. Look at her stomach—she’s been impregnated with spider eggs. It’s likely a forced conception. With that kind of internal mutation, there’s honestly nothing we can do. Even if we take her with us, would any high-ranking user in the Hall Plane step up for her? Maybe. Let’s say she survives. Her reality would still be a living hell. It might be kinder to end it now.”

“Is… that so?” 

“Let’s ask her what she wants. First, we’ll need to cut her down.”

Seeing his face darken, I quickly added, “She’s not exactly a pleasant sight hanging up there like that. It’s practically like gawking at her exposed body.” Just as I stood to act, a voice interrupted.

“Yohohoho!”

A frivolous laugh filled the clearing. The sudden sound startled the kids. The overwhelming presence from above signaled that the dungeon’s master was finally approaching. I signaled the kids with a glance and rested my hand on my sword.

“Two men, yes! Two women—ugh, no, I mean two! Anyway, two!”

The high-pitched voice suggested a female entity. She cheered for the men but jeered at the women, prompting Yu-jeong to bristle and stand up.

“Who’s there?!”

“Who could it be~?”

“Stop spouting nonsense from the shadows! Why don’t you show yourself?”

“I’m coming~!”

*Rustle. Rustle.*

Amplifying my hearing with mana, I detected a single entity descending from the ceiling. It kept chattering, further infuriating Yu-jeong.

“Oh? A feisty human female? I don’t like spirited ones. But I do, too. They make perfect hosts. Like the one hanging up there. Heeheehee!”

Yu-jeong, about to hurl another insult, paled at the word “host.” She seemed to grasp its meaning, goosebumps rising on her skin. I smacked my lips. The presence above was on a different level from the monsters we’d faced so far—comparable to the Rite of Passage’s boss, perhaps. If the kids were in top condition, we might stand a chance. But right now, they were at their limits. I sighed and stood up. It looked like I’d have to handle this myself.

“Everyone, get up. It seems the dungeon’s master has arrived.”

“Correct!”

A rustling sound accompanied a lively voice from above. Looking up, I saw a spider over two meters tall circling the hanging female user as it descended. Its size was impressive, but the most striking feature was the human-like face protruding from the center of its upper body. A human-faced spider.

Before the kids could react, the spider skittered down and landed with a soft “thud,” though it tried to land gracefully. The dungeon master, the ancient alchemist Vivian, was this spider. She beamed at us with a bright smile.

“Welcome, my new prey.”

“Prey? That’s rude right off the bat.”

I responded calmly, and the spider tilted its head, pondering before smiling widely and offering a more formal greeting.

“Welcome to my dungeon, human males. Oh, I don’t welcome human females.”

“Crazy bitch.”

Yu-jeong’s sharp retort hit the mark. The kids had fully recognized the spider as an enemy, especially after seeing what it had done to the female user, Jeong Ji-yeon. Though their legs trembled, they stood, glaring at the spider with murderous intent. The human-faced spider scanned us, pouting before continuing.

“Oh? I gave you a proper welcome, and you insult me? Why the hostile looks?”

“You think we’d just smile and wave, you idiot?” 

Yu-jeong’s barrage continued, calling the spider “crazy” and “stupid.” The spider’s face fell, as if deeply hurt, before responding in a grumbling tone.

“Tch. I don’t like you. I went out of my way to welcome you, but you’re a female, so I guess I didn’t. Fine, I’ll welcome you too!”

“Shut it. Your welcome makes me sick.”

“Ugh, that’s harsh. Why do you hate me so much?”

“What?!”

Yu-jeong looked dumbfounded by the spider’s innocent question. But soon, her eyes burned with fury as she pointed at the ceiling and shouted.

“Don’t you see that woman up there? You did that to her, and you expect us to be okay with it?”

At Yu-jeong’s scathing accusation, the spider tilted its head again before replying.

“That’s only natural. They invaded my lair first. They destroyed my precious subordinates, my children, and my home. I was minding my own business when they attacked me. Should I have just let them?”

“What?!”

“You’re no different. No, you’ve caused even more chaos. I’m the one who should be angry. Look at my children’s bodies! You crushed my unborn babies. Poor things. *Sob, sob.*”

As the spider dabbed at its eyes with its long, hairy legs, I couldn’t help but chuckle. Yu-jeong, speechless, could only gape.
