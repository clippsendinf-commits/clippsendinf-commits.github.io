# Memorize - Chapter 87: The Ruined Laboratory

As I grabbed it by the hair and lifted, I saw its hollow gaze glaring at me. So what if it glares? That look irritated me, and I wanted to crush its head with a single blow, but there were priorities to handle first. 

Since I knew little about the Ruined Laboratory, I needed to extract every bit of information possible from this creature. I immediately locked eyes with it and activated my Third Eye.

*The monster before you is classified as a Mang-in. Unlike typical Mang-in, these beings possess both physical bodies and emotions. In the era when the Hall Plane thrived, its arrogant inhabitants devised an experiment. It began with the idea of playing god, creating a new kind of human…*

After skimming through the flood of information, I gently released its hair. With a thud, it hit the ground. Staring at its head, I slowly raised my foot.

“Vivian.”

“Yes?” Vivian responded in a calm tone. Her gaze on the Mang-in was indifferent. Among our group, only Vivian had maintained her composure from the dungeon’s entrance to now. Having lived a tumultuous life herself, this must have seemed trivial to her.

“Anything you recall about this laboratory? Any detail will do.”

“Hmm…” Vivian’s face turned thoughtful for a moment before she glanced at the Mang-in and spoke.

“I don’t remember much. But it seems these are people who were experimented on.”

“Experimented on?” I echoed.

She nodded once or twice. By now, the entire group was focused on her words. The Mang-in, which had appeared so menacing at first, was now an afterthought.

“Yes. Back when magical engineering and alchemy were at their peak, there was talk of setting up a laboratory to create new humans.”

“And then?”

“I don’t know. For some reason, it was shut down and buried. I can’t recall the details. But this guy is probably one of the poor souls sacrificed in those experiments.”

“I see.”

Vivian concluded neatly. I brought my raised foot down hard. With the sound of a skull shattering, the corridor was instantly stained with blood. I looked down to check—it was dead in one blow, no further movement.

The kids wore neutral expressions. But Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong, seeing this side of me for the first time, stared with stunned faces. They were used to my quiet demeanor, so this bold action must have shocked them. Ignoring their reactions, I turned to An-sol.

“An-sol.”

“Y-Yes…” she answered timidly. When I frowned, she quickly raised her head. From past experiences, she knew I was different in combat than usual.

“You’ve practiced some divine spells, right?”

“Binding, protection, and healing…” Her voice grew quieter as she spoke. If only she had the *Holy Striking* spell—it would’ve been incredibly useful. Swallowing my disappointment, I turned away. An-sol seemed to have more to say, her lips trembling, but I had no time for her hesitation now.

“We’ll proceed deeper inside. Stay alert for traps or ambushes. Our primary goal is to secure an exit route and explore the building based on this corridor. Jeong Ha-yeon?”

“Yes?”

“Can you maintain the Light spell continuously?”

“I can, but if I do, I won’t be able to use double casting.”

*Swift Casting* and double casting—impressive. She’d learned nearly all the essentials for a mage. *Swift Casting* alone was enough for now. I nodded, and we maintained formation, moving forward.

“Arise, Queritatus! The Screaming Slayer of the 14th Legion!”

“*Cone of Aqua*!”

A piercing wail, like a cry from the abyss, filled the hall above the glowing magic circle. This was Vivian’s chimera beast summoning. At the same time, cone-shaped, dark red masses of liquid rose from the pooling blood of the Mang-in on the floor—Jeong Ha-yeon’s work.

The Mang-in, annoyed by the mages relentlessly firing spells from the rear, kept pushing forward. My tight defense held them at bay, but some began to flank us. I raised my voice.

“An-hyeon, Mang-in are heading your way. An-sol, Shin Sang-yong, provide support!”

“Ugh, again? Damn it! What are these things?!” An-hyeon shouted, swinging his spear wildly, while Shin Sang-yong responded calmly. I let my sword hang loosely to the side. The sensation of cutting through tough muscle coursed through the blade—likely one had taken advantage of my brief glance away.

“Kraaaa!”

I sliced its shoulder, making it stagger, but it was tenacious. Even with one arm half-severed, dangling limply, the Mang-in kept charging. Like the Deadmen from the Rite of Passage, they wouldn’t stop unless their heads were destroyed.

But targeting their heads was too much for the kids. Deadmen were slow, making headshots feasible, but Mang-in had human-like builds and moved with far greater agility. Asking the kids to aim for their heads in this chaos was unreasonable.

An-hyeon and Yu-jeong’s formation was being pushed back bit by bit, but they held their ground, thanks to the full support of Jeong Ha-yeon, Shin Sang-yong, An-sol, and Vivian. Meanwhile, I faced the largest wave of Mang-in alone, without any backup.

My sword danced. Having reached the pinnacle of *Mind and Sword as One*, every stroke carried extraordinary intent. I deflected an attacking Mang-in’s hand with the flat of my blade, redirecting it to strike another’s face. Taking advantage of their stunned pause, I cut them both down cleanly.

Each swing felled two or three Mang-in, but more filled their place instantly. I’d already taken down over thirty, yet their numbers didn’t dwindle. It was starting to get on my nerves. Compared to the hundred Landmoles we fought before, this was at least twice as many, and we were battling in the first-floor hall of the laboratory.

“*Shackles*!” An-sol’s chant rang out, followed by the sound of something collapsing to my left. I wanted to check on the kids, but a Mang-in lunged with its jaws wide, forcing me to drive my sword into its throat first.

“Hng! Hnng!” Yu-jeong’s excited grunts echoed. Her cries sounded oddly suggestive, but they always signaled her delivering results that met my expectations. In chaotic melees like this, Yu-jeong shone brighter than An-hyeon. True to form, her spirited blade clashes spurred me to accelerate my own swordplay.

*Slash, slash, slash, slash.*

*Thud, thud, thud, thud.*

But soon, I grew bored, cutting down Mang-in after Mang-in. Each strike sent heads flying, one after another. It couldn’t be helped—my swordsmanship and stats were too high for this. I couldn’t even use my full techniques.

In the latter half of my first cycle, every day was a fierce struggle. A moment’s lapse could mean death, and battles were thrilling, tense affairs. Compared to that, these fights felt like child’s play.

Since I planned to officially register our clan after this expedition, there was no need to hide my strength anymore. Discovering and conquering two dungeons in under two months as Year 0 users was already noteworthy enough.

After this, I’d leave the city for one final expedition. I expected clan approval to come through while we were at the Cave of Screams. Even if it didn’t, it wouldn’t matter—the Cave’s success would guarantee approval. Hiding my abilities further would be petty and foolish. The time was right to reveal my strength, boost our clan’s value, and attract talent.

“Huh…?”

Lost in thought, I felt my sword slice through empty air. Startled, I looked up to see the relentless Mang-in hesitating, stepping back. As beings with emotions, it wasn’t surprising they felt fear, but why now…?

Then it hit me. I’d been so bored, planning ahead, that I hadn’t noticed my swordsmanship slipping into its natural, refined state. I’d meant to hold back, leaving room for ambiguity, but my body had instinctively reverted to its honed techniques.

Before me lay a pile of Mang-in corpses, each cut clean and precise. Worried the others might notice, I glanced back, but my fears were unfounded.

“Phew, Vivian saved us!” Yu-jeong said, wiping sweat.

“Haa…” An-sol exhaled, looking up.

Following their gazes, I saw a figure radiating overwhelming menace—Vivian’s Screaming Slayer of the 14th Legion. A beast from the 10-series legions, it was no weakling. The group likely thought the Mang-in were terrified of it, but their eyes were mostly on me. Thanks to Vivian’s timely intervention, I sighed in relief and reorganized our formation.

“Huff, huff. Sol, heal me while we have a breather!”

“Heal? Take a potion for now.”

An-hyeon, struggling in close combat, grabbed An-sol, breathing heavily. She handed him a potion and began murmuring a spell.

The battle paused briefly. Jeong Ha-yeon looked fine but showed slight fatigue from casting so many spells. Her *Cone of Aqua*, which entangled the Mang-in’s legs, was a brilliant move. I hadn’t seen Shin Sang-yong fight, but his support had kept Yu-jeong unharmed, so he must have performed well. I chuckled, imagining how tough this would’ve been without them.

Vivian, staring at me blankly, spoke softly.

“Su-hyeon. Su-hyeon.”

“What?”

“What now?”

She pointed upward. As a powerhouse capable of wiping out the Mang-in instantly, I’d told her before we left the city to hold back, letting the kids gain experience, and only unleash her full strength if things got dire.

Her judgment differed from mine. I thought we could push a bit more, but since she’d already summoned Queritatus, sending it back seemed pointless. I gave a slight nod. Her face brightened—she’d been unsure herself.

With a cold smile, she commanded her summon.

“What are you waiting for, Queritatus? Wipe them all out. Leave none alive.”

Queritatus answered with a bone-rattling scream, releasing a dark mist. I watched with interest. As a class I hadn’t seen in my first cycle, it intrigued me. If nurtured well, two Chimera Alchemists might rival a Secret Class like the Spirit Summoner.

As I mused, the Mang-in’s pitiful screams filled the hall. The kids, now somewhat accustomed, no longer flinched at the carnage. An-hyeon, ever belligerent, even cheered the summon on.

In less than two minutes, Queritatus eradicated the remaining Mang-in.
