# Memorize - Chapter 127: Temporary Alliance

"Those were the eyes of someone deep in thought. Sometimes, when you look at me, it feels like you're wrestling with something."

"..."

Deep in thought, huh? I narrowed my eyes. I tried to hold it in, but a chuckle kept threatening to escape. Taking a deep breath to steady myself, I suppressed the sound as much as possible.

Go Yeon-ju slowly pulled away from me, subtly increasing the distance between us. As she stepped back, her gaze fixed on a straight path ahead, I sensed a strange unease. But before I could pinpoint it, she continued, not giving me a moment to process.

"But I couldn’t just let that thought slide. It felt too dangerous to ignore... You know, every time I catch you looking at me with those eyes, it sends shivers down my spine. It’s chilling."

"Hmm."

By now, the cigarette I’d been holding had gone cold. Hers, too, had lost its flame. I spat out the cigarette and let it fall into my hand. Rolling the butt between my fingers, I realized I’d been too lax. I thought I’d been observing her closely, but she’d been watching me even more intently, outdoing me by a step.

Go Yeon-ju flicked her cigarette butt away with a light snap of her fingers and spoke softly.

"What could that thought be? What kind of dilemma is making my skin crawl like this? I was so curious, and by sheer chance, I figured it out."

"When was that?"

"When I teased you with some information. That’s when User Kim Su-hyeon mentioned SSUN and the city of Halo. That’s when I finally felt it. The true nature of that dilemma..."

"The true nature...?"

Go Yeon-ju gave a faint smile at my question, pausing for effect. It was then that I realized the source of my unease. I started to turn my head, but before I could, her voice cut through to my ears.

"Killing intent."

Damn. The moment I heard her words, I instinctively calculated her position and the distance between us. My eyes darted to the sword I’d left leaning against the table, but it was gone.

"Looking for this?"

Her voice pulled my gaze back up, and I swallowed hard. Her slender fingers came into view, and somehow, she was twirling my sword’s hilt playfully. Without hesitation, I grabbed a chopstick from the table and lunged at her.

"Ho ho, a chopstick?"

Despite my swift move, Go Yeon-ju let out a relaxed laugh. Then, her figure seemed to sink into the ground and vanished. I immediately activated my Third Eye, flooding my body with mana.

I recognized the techniques she’d just used. She’d likely combined Presence Concealment and Black Shadow. But both could be countered with my Third Eye. With my unique ability active, I quickly scanned the shadows around me.

The shadowed area under the table didn’t trigger my Third Eye. That meant...

"Gotcha. Behind you~"

At that moment, a figure sprang up from my own shadow on the floor. Go Yeon-ju’s mocking voice rang out, accompanied by a sharp whistle of air being sliced. It was a split-second moment, but I kept my composure. Sorry to say, but I’d faced these techniques countless times in my first cycle—I wasn’t about to fall for them so easily.

I unleashed the ability I’d prepared.

*Swish. Clack.*

"...Oh my."

"Not behind, but in front, Shadow Queen."

I held the chopstick to her slender neck, whispering softly in her ear.

To sum it up, Go Yeon-ju had tried to get behind me using the shadows but failed against my ability’s counter. No, it was beyond failure—I’d turned the tables and taken her back instead. By revealing a hidden ability, I’d outmaneuvered her.

Go Yeon-ju stood frozen, as if she hadn’t anticipated this. Her dagger, which she hadn’t intended to harm me with, stopped at a safe distance. I, too, had no intention of killing her yet, so I didn’t press the chopstick further.

Finally, she spoke in a trembling voice.

"No... no way... Is this Shadow Step?"

"Oh? You know it? Correct."

"It’s definitely... Wait. That guy from the Istantel Rowe Clan... No, I heard that technique was still in development! How do you...?"

Oh, that guy. Yeah, I learned it from him in the first cycle. Figured I needed at least one ace up my sleeve. I wanted to say that, but I stayed silent.

When I pressed the chopstick slightly, I felt her neck tremble faintly. Being subdued so easily must’ve been a shock to her.

To be honest, there was a bit of luck involved. Go Yeon-ju hadn’t gone all out, but more importantly, I was intimately familiar with her combat style and techniques. In the first cycle, I’d faced her on the battlefield multiple times. As one of the Ten Strongest, her patterns had been thoroughly analyzed by my clan. Thanks to that, I’d cracked her techniques, and in the end, the Shadow Queen was literally executed by Han So-yeong, the Princess of Execution.

In short, she hadn’t gone all out, I outclassed her in skill, I knew all of the Shadow Queen’s techniques, and I’d been prepared with my Third Eye. These four factors harmonized perfectly to let me subdue her in one move. If she’d come at me with full force, I was confident I could win, but it wouldn’t have been this easy. After all, her special ability, Abyss Crowd, was notoriously difficult to deal with.

Of course, the woman before me had no way of knowing these circumstances. On the surface, a fifth-year user had been overpowered by a zero-year user. Even if I had abnormal strength, for the Shadow Queen—one of the Ten Strongest—to be taken down so easily by a rookie was something even Go Yeon-ju would struggle to accept...

"Surrender."

She accepted it. With surprising ease, she dropped both her dagger and my sword. Her swift reaction nearly made me drop the chopstick, but I managed to hold on. Part of me found it absurd, but in a way, this was very much like her.

She might seem free-spirited and hard to control, but once she pledged loyalty, she stuck to it until the end. The Princess of Execution knew this, which is why she tore her apart without hesitation once she was incapacitated.

Pressing the chopstick against her neck, I fell into thought. Kill her or not? Kill her or not? Thinking back to the first cycle, killing her would be easier, but I couldn’t shake a lingering reluctance. How could I make this woman an ally? How had those guys in the past managed to win over the free-spirited Go Yeon-ju?

While I was lost in thought, her deflated voice broke through.

"Haa... Yeah, that’s the feeling."

"What do you mean?"

"That killing intent I sometimes saw in your eyes—it felt exactly like this. Like you were debating whether to kill me or let me live."

Her words hit the mark, and I had no response. Silence stretched between us. Perhaps finding it stifling, she cleared her throat and continued.

"Can I turn around now?"

"...Slowly. Keep both hands up."

Following my instructions, she raised her hands and turned slowly. She glanced at the chopstick with a playful look. I let out a short laugh and dropped the chopstick, kicking her dagger and my sword away at the same time. Though neither of us had weapons, my Mind and Sword as One rank had reached EX, giving me a clear advantage.

"Guess you decided to let me live. But my arms are getting tired."

"Yeah, keep them up. Looks good."

"You really are a pervert."

"Pfft."

I snorted and lowered her arms for her. She shot me a coy glance before brushing past me and flopping onto the bed with a heavy thud that made it creak. By now, I could handle most of her impulsive actions with calm.

Burying her face in the bed I’d been using, she mumbled in a weary voice.

"Ugh... I’m exhausted. What a rough day. Nearly died, humiliated, and for what?"

"Maybe it’s just not your day."

She grumbled petulantly at my response. She looked composed on the surface, but it was clear she was deeply upset.

After rolling around on the bed for a while, she locked eyes with me and patted the empty space beside her. I understood her intent but chose to sit on the edge of the bed instead of lying down.

There was no need to stay on guard with her anymore. Her face screamed, “I’m exhausted. I’ve lost all will to fight.”

Scooting closer, she rested her head on my thigh. Caught off guard by becoming her pillow, I gave a wry smile. The brief skirmish had left the atmosphere awkward, but one thing was clear: by sparing her, I’d earned a life debt from her. As one of the Ten Strongest, she’d understand the weight of that.

Savoring my thigh for a moment, she let out a long sigh and spoke.

"Phew... Anyway, this makes things pretty clear."

"What does?"

I asked lightly, and she reached up, playfully poking my nose with her fingertip.

"I thought I might die just now. But here I am, alive. You were definitely debating whether to kill me or let me live."

I didn’t respond. She glared at me with a pout, taking my silence as confirmation. After staring for a while, she clicked her tongue and continued.

"But since you chose to let me live, I can assume you want something from me. So, can you just tell me already? We’d never met before you came to Mul. What do you want from me, and why do you want to kill me?"

"..."

"Don’t just stay silent—spill it. I need to know what’s going on so I can respond properly."

She kept pressing, but I deliberately held back. Go Yeon-ju was different from Jeong Ha-yeon or Shin Sang-yong. As one of the Ten Strongest and a Secret Class holder, she had immense pride and her own way of thinking. While my caravan was impressive and my plans were well-regarded, that alone wouldn’t be enough to convince her to join the clan I planned to form. I could already see her refusing. Sure, I could kill her if she did, but I couldn’t shake the lingering regret. The potential she could bring to my party and future clan was unimaginable.

After much deliberation, I made my decision: “I can’t decide right now.” She was intrigued by me, and I wanted to observe her more. That meant giving her time to spend with me and the group, allowing me to watch her closely and assess her further.

With that settled, I calmly reached out and stroked her soft hair. She closed her eyes gently, feeling my touch.

"It’s getting pretty late, don’t you think?"

"Huh? Why the formal tone all of a sudden?"

Savoring my touch, she opened her eyes slightly at my words.

You started speaking casually first, I wanted to say, but I held back. I had a condition to propose, one she wouldn’t be able to refuse. Having just owed me her life, she’d likely go along with it.

More importantly, at the end of the Cave of Screams, *that guy* awaited. Having Go Yeon-ju around would be a huge help. I wet my lips and spoke before they dried.

"Business hasn’t been great lately, has it? Since things turned out this way, why not take a break?"

"Hmm...?"

Her hum turned sultry at my words. Confirming her reaction, I continued slowly.
