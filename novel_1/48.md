# Chapter 47: Dungeon of Alchemist

In conclusion, the kids couldn’t master detection in a single day. Far from the one-hour goal I set, Yu-jeong lasted the longest at 28 minutes before collapsing. Honestly, for their first attempt, it was praiseworthy, but I deliberately refrained from saying anything.

As a frontier city, the small town of Mul only had the buildings that were there when it was first discovered. The only new structures were the bare essentials. Unlike larger cities, there were no dedicated training facilities. So, for the time being, I planned to focus solely on detection training.

While the kids were training, I left the inn under the pretense of gathering information. Even though I remembered the past, there was no guarantee my information was accurate. Especially for minor details, it was best to verify before acting. But first, there was one matter I needed to settle.

Before moving on, I headed to the user-exclusive warehouse. Think of it as an inventory you can’t carry around. Classified as a <Setting> in the Hall Plane, it’s a personal space no one else can access, but it’s limited to storing items purchased with GP.

Recalling its location, I carefully examined the items inside. As the saying goes, “If you hoard it, it turns to waste.” I felt more at ease using what I could now. I pulled out all the elixirs and, without hesitation, downed them one by one.

```
[Using Tears of the Angel. 6 additional stat points have been generated.]
[Using Elixir of Stamina Enhancement. Stamina increases by 2 points.]
[Using Elixir of Vision. 1 additional stat point has been generated.]
```

Seeing the messages pop up in sequence, I gave a satisfied smile. Eager to check the results, I immediately opened my user information window.

The more I looked at my stats, abilities, and remaining points, the more a mix of pride and unfamiliarity washed over me. A strange thrill, unlike anything I felt in my first cycle, gripped my body.

Boss Monster: 2 points. Tears of the Angel: 6 points. Stamina Elixir: 2 points. User mission reward: 4 points. Excluding the 2 points from the Stamina Elixir, I had 12 stat points left. Additionally, I had one point remaining to upgrade a potential ability’s rank.

I still hadn’t decided where to invest my stat points. Rationally, Stamina was the right choice. But emotionally, my eyes kept drifting to Strength, Magic, or Agility. Truthfully, I wasn’t trying to resist the urge. The same indecision plagued my ability points. I deeply regretted that I couldn’t invest in my Unique Ability.

Stats: Strength, Endurance, Agility, Stamina, Magic.

Potential Abilities: Close-Quarters Combat, Indomitable, Mind’s Eye (True).

Others—users—would probably throw stones at me, calling this a “happy dilemma.”

Unable to decide, I put it off again. Since I’d already absorbed everything, I could allocate points whenever needed. I wanted to think it over more, and with unknown challenges ahead, I also wanted to be prepared for situations I couldn’t handle.

After some thought, I decided to store the Formless Sword and Elixir in the user warehouse for now. Both were late-game gear, unnecessary for the early stages. Besides, even though the Formless Sword looked unassuming, a sharp-eyed user with an exploration-related class might notice it and cause trouble. I’d retrieve them once I obtained a subspace, a mark of a high-ranking user. I withdrew 300 gold coins—about a third of my gold—and finished my business at the warehouse.

Turning my head, I saw the quiet main street of the city. The information I needed wasn’t about the current state of the Northern Continent but about the goals we aimed to achieve. Honestly, if time weren’t an issue, I’d prefer to grow steadily by clearing monsters in unstable regions.

But time was tight. I wanted to establish an official clan name before the First Coalition War broke out and clans started rising. Unless it was a branch of a major clan, launching a formal clan in just three months was incredibly difficult.

The only option was to cherry-pick Mul’s best opportunities to rack up achievements quickly.

I identified three must-conquer locations in Mul:

The Ruined Laboratory. The Dungeon of the Ancient Alchemist Vivian. The Cave of Screams.

The Cave of Screams was discovered by chance by a caravan I was part of in my second year. But the Laboratory and the Alchemist’s Dungeon were only known by rumors, requiring preparation.

Most novice users think finding caves or dungeons is easy. They’re wrong. Such places are never easily stumbled upon. Some are hidden within barriers, while others require specific items to enter.

My Third Eye might solve some of these issues, but there were too many uncertainties to be optimistic.

I decided to head to the library. In the Hall Plane, libraries collect all kinds of documents and records, open for users to access.

With the local situation chaotic and Mul being a newly established frontier city, even the leading clans prioritized stabilization. Openly setting out to explore caves or dungeons in this climate would be foolish. I knew going to the library might seem pointless, but I had no choice.

If it came to it, I could start with the Cave of Screams. But I wanted to save that one for last, if possible.

*

Four days passed. During that time, the kids showed clear growth. Sol, in particular, made remarkable progress. Her high Magic stat had initially caused control issues, but after teaching her my efficient mana management techniques and guiding her a few times, her skills improved dramatically day by day.

As time went on, I increased my demands. I told them to maintain detection while moving, not just standing still. The kids, who had barely reached 40 minutes of sustained detection, regressed the moment movement was added.

An-hyeon and Yu-jeong complained, but I silenced them with one line: “What, are you going to stand still and fight in battle?”

I added one more task for Sol. Among the basic divine spells priests learn, Shackles is one of the most useful early on, alongside Cure.

*Clink!*

I pulled out a silver coin and flicked it high into the air. The coin spun and eventually fell back into my hand. Looking at Sol, who was watching with a serious expression, I calmly explained the training method.

“Remember the moment I caught the coin. For mages and priests, after Magic, spell-casting speed is critical. How quickly and accurately you can cast the spell you intend—that’s the key. Catch the coin mid-air with Shackles before it hits the ground.”

“Yes!”

Sol replied energetically, beaming. I gave her a gentle smile. Suddenly, she leaned forward, startling me. But I quickly realized what she wanted and reached out to pat her head.

After sending a giggling Sol off, I was about to dive back into the documents I’d brought from the library when I heard the door next to mine burst open. Moments later, my door flew open with a rough noise. Looking up, I saw Yu-jeong’s face peeking in.
