# Memorize - Chapter 50: Dungeon of Alchemist

“Did you hear the rumor? They say another dungeon was discovered in Mul.”
“The Black Forest. The dungeon of the ancient alchemist Vivian. I’m thinking of heading back to Mul. Who knows? There might still be something left.”
“You already found the Cave of Screams. Don’t get greedy. But something’s a bit off. It seems like some users discovered it before.”
“Found it by chance, failed, and all died, I heard. Well, ‘died’ might not be the right word. Huh? Three people. No, maybe one. What do I mean, you ask…”

My party and I packed lightly and left the inn. It was early, so Go Yeon-ju was nowhere to be seen. An-hyeon kept glancing back at *The Modest Lady* as if reluctant to leave.

Mul’s north gate was a stark contrast to Barbara’s grandeur—shabby and underwhelming. A couple of guards stood watch, but their disheveled appearance didn’t inspire confidence. Even for a frontier city, this state of affairs suggested the ruling clan’s lord lacked competence.

“Stay safe out there. May the angels’ blessings be with you, users,” one guard said, saluting.

“Thank you,” I replied, returning the gesture.

We passed through the north gate. An-hyeon, curious after hearing the residents speak, turned to me with a question.

“Hyung, who exactly are the residents?”

“Residents? The original inhabitants of Hall Plane. You could say you were a resident of Earth before.”

“Hmm. Are they different from us? I heard some users say users are like nobles and residents are like commoners.”

Nobles and commoners. Residents are weak—too weak to survive the dangers scattered across Hall Plane without users. Things improve slightly as you move to Atlanta and then Terra, but at least up to Barbara, residents rely on users for protection. Those in discovered and developed cities are relatively safe, but for unexplored ones, the future is uncertain. There’s even a case in the Southern Continent where a city was found in ruins, not a single resident left—likely massacred by invaders.

Residents see users as divine emissaries. They believe in gods on Hall Plane, and some claim to have met angels who bestowed their will upon them. To them, users are saviors sent by divine command, blessed by angels. In truth, users are kidnapped by angels and given powers through their system, but residents view our strength as a divine gift. That’s why they look at us with a mix of goodwill and reverence.

The noble-and-commoner dynamic comes from the users’ perspective—a hierarchy of superior and inferior. In the Western Continent, known for its boundless freedom, residents are practically treated as slaves. The Northern Continent is less extreme, but the view of residents as beneath users is undeniable. At first, I found it a bit sad—aren’t we all human? But that’s how it is.

The cities, dungeons, and laboratories discovered so far hint at a time when Hall Plane thrived. From what I know, some event caused it to lose that prosperity and power. Now, residents live in daily fear of monster attacks, reduced to a precarious existence.

I summarized this for An-hyeon. The others, curious too, nodded along. I told them there’s no need to pity the residents, but treating them too harshly isn’t a good look either, wrapping up the topic.

Oddly, not a single user was in sight, despite expecting to see a few. The Golden Lion Clan’s influence was palpable—the northern cities were deserted, while Barbara, the southern, western, and central hubs, must be overflowing with users. For a moment, I felt an urge to join them.

The sentimental mood faded as we walked. The scenery around Mul’s northern outskirts shifted gradually. The path grew rough and uneven, with fewer signs of human passage. But it wasn’t unpleasant. The untouched nature was a rare sight compared to Earth, where such landscapes are hard to come by. A gentle breeze lifted the kids’ spirits, and they occasionally glanced around, taking in the view.

As the foliage thickened, I paused to check my map. To the left, a forest; to the right, a plain. The Black Forest lay through the forest, as expected. My memory hadn’t failed me. Folding the map neatly, I tucked it away and turned northwest without hesitation.

We tread through a lush, green forest. The fields beyond Mul’s north gate still glowed with vibrant life, but as we neared the Black Forest, that vibrancy dulled. Dark, towering trees began to dominate, their sticky branches exuding an imposing presence. We had reached the edge of the Black Forest.

Glancing back at the kids trailing me, I spoke in a low voice. “This is the entrance to the Black Forest. Stay sharp and brace yourselves.”

The deeper we went, the heavier the air grew. Calling this place a forest felt almost inadequate. The terrain was sharply divided into highlands and lowlands, and its vastness was overwhelming—nothing like the forest from the Rite of Passage. Though it was morning and faint sunlight filtered through, I knew that deeper in, even that would vanish. If it was this dim now, night would be pitch black, so securing a safe zone today was a must. For now, I could still see well enough to scout the surroundings.

The kids gripped their weapons tightly, tension creeping in. Then, as I turned to check on them, I spotted something odd—a trace. It was pure chance; if I hadn’t looked, I might’ve missed it. My heightened senses caught it in that fleeting moment.

The kids, startled by my pause, stared at me. I moved to the spot and crouched to inspect it closely. Seeing my expression harden, they exchanged glances before gathering around me cautiously.

Footprints. Human ones, and not just a few. No users had been at the north gate, so these could be from another direction. While it wasn’t strange for users to be here, something felt off. The tracks weren’t old—recent, maybe a day or two.

“Oppa, why are you staring at the ground?” Yu-jeong asked.

I didn’t respond, activating my Third Eye to gather more details. Yu-jeong called out again, but I was too focused.

“Oppa? Oppa!”

“Unnie, he’s tracing right now. Just wait,” An-sol whispered.

“Tracing? Isn’t that for archers or assassins?”

“It is, but I heard anyone with enough experience or training can do it to some extent. Still, they can’t match someone with a specialized class.”

“No way. So oppa learned it?”

Their chatter filtered through as I sifted through the influx of information. Archers have tracking skills, but my Third Eye’s broad scope made gathering trace data effortless. No offense to An-sol, but my unique ability likely surpassed most specialized users.

Finishing my analysis, I stood. “Looks like a caravan of five or six passed through two or three days ago. Not from the north gate—probably explorers from elsewhere. I can’t tell if they were lost or came here on purpose, but there’s no sign of aimless wandering. At least one of them was a decent archer. The tracks all lead one way.”

What happened to them, I couldn’t say. Seeing the past, like during the Rite of Passage, would require more effort, but there was no need now. The traces were enough to piece together a rough picture.

An-hyeon and Yu-jeong gaped, while An-sol’s eyes widened in surprise. I shrugged off their stares. Yu-jeong tilted her head, curious. “So, there are other people in this forest besides us?”

“Maybe. Maybe not.”

Her question was sharper than expected. I kept my answer vague, but her eyes narrowed. Sighing, I elaborated. “There are footprints going in, but none coming out. They might’ve left another way, or they’re still wandering. Or… they could be dead.”

The kids’ faces turned uneasy, exchanging glances. I kept my expression neutral and turned to move on. In the city, I’d let their antics slide, but in the field, I wouldn’t be so lenient.

Sensing my shift in mood, their footsteps grew quieter, betraying their tension. The deeper we went, the more the towering trees blotted out the sky. The faint sunlight from the entrance was gone.

We walked on. By the time we left the entrance behind, darkness had fully settled. It wasn’t pitch black yet, but for morning, it was dim enough to hint at what night would bring. The Black Forest lived up to its name.

Without my prompting, the kids activated their detection skills. Thanks to my Third Eye and the detection I’d taught them, we maintained our pace. No one spoke. Each step was accompanied only by the rustle of grass and their shallow breaths.

Then—a low growl. *Krrr.* Followed by the sharp rustle of bushes being pushed aside. Something was approaching fast, likely aware of us and intent on attacking.

As I stopped, the kids froze, their faces tense. They were on alert but hadn’t yet sensed the monsters. With their detection active, they’d notice soon, but I warned them first.

“Ambush. Monsters coming from both sides. Get ready. Sol, to the center. Hyeon, Yu-jeong, back-to-back defensive formation.”

“Huh… what?” Yu-jeong stammered.

“Don’t make me repeat myself. Focus and form up around Sol.”

At the word “ambush,” confusion flickered across their faces. Yu-jeong’s question was cut off by my sharp tone. She trembled, gripping her daggers. An-hyeon angled his spear, and An-sol began chanting a spell. They quickly formed a defensive circle. I moved beside An-sol to act as her keeper. Drawing my sword, a chilling *shring* echoed through the forest.

*[Special Ability: Mind and Sword as One activated.]*  
*[Potential Ability: Close-Quarters Combat activated.]*  
*[Potential Ability: Mind’s Eye (Static) activated.]*

*Swish! Fwing!*

As we braced, the sound of rustling grass and a harsh whoosh tore through the air. My detection pinged, and from the forest’s shadows, a gleaming tail lashed out, aiming for An-hyeon and Yu-jeong.

“Don’t dodge! Strike it!”

I shouted, but they’d already moved, sidestepping based on their detection. An-hyeon, puzzled by my order, saw the tail extend and swung his spear, hitting its midsection with a dull thud. Yu-jeong ducked nimbly but didn’t strike as I’d instructed. Though she evaded, the attack wasn’t over. The tail, missing her, veered slightly and shot toward An-sol.

An-sol, mid-chant, froze as the spike aimed for her, her face blank with shock.
