# Chapter 67: Vivian la Clarté

Hwa-jeong, the Essence of Fire. Literally, it translates to "the deity in charge of fire," but in the Hall Plane, it can be understood as the purest crystallization of flame. A power capable of incinerating all that exists. The reason Seraph fiercely opposed the fusion of my body with Hwa-jeong lies in this very power.

Hwa-jeong is a mythical-grade flame that can burn everything in existence. It surpasses even the highest tier of flames that humans can control, the Flame Rank, and while Seraph compared it to other powers, in terms of pure *destruction*, it might even make the Hellfire that rules the lowest layer of the Eight Hells, Avīci, take a step back. That is, if the ancient records I studied are true.

More importantly, when combined with the power of my Sword Specialist ability, which can *cut through anything*, Hwa-jeong’s power allows me to *slice and burn everything in this world*. The catch is that Hwa-jeong, being of mythical rank, carries the attribute of *deicide*. In theory, if I so desired, I could kill Seraph herself with this power. (Not that angels are pushovers, mind you—it’s merely theoretical.)

In any case, if even the fearsome Hellfire of the Eight Hells would yield to Hwa-jeong, there was no way the mere threads of a human-faced spider could withstand its flames. After confirming that the others had been cocooned and were dangling in the air, I immediately summoned my mana.

*Whoosh!*

“Wha… what?”

A faint vermilion mana flared up, and the threads wrapped around my body melted away like ice cream in an instant. Vivian, her face contorted in panic, frantically shot more threads at me, but the outcome was the same. Narrowing her eyes for a moment, she seemed to make up her mind and opened her mandibles wide. It looked like she was about to spew venom, the yellowish liquid glinting ominously.

“Insolent!”

Vivian let out a roar, and a wave of foul-smelling venom surged toward me from her mouth. Maintaining a calm smile, I casually let the venom hit me. The moment it touched my skin, it evaporated into thin air without a trace.

“*Heeheehee*. What to do? I didn’t want to kill you, but you’re making me so angry.”

“I’m not dead.”

I replied lightly and stepped forward. Vivian’s face twisted as if she were looking at a monster, and she clamped her mouth shut. Ugh, how unfair. *She’s* the monster, and I’m just a human—why am I getting this treatment? Rubbing my pristine skin, I continued walking. Whether the venom tried to seep into my body or merely touched me, as long as I wielded Hwa-jeong’s power, it would burn away effortlessly.

“No… no way.”

“What’s ‘no way’ about it?”

“How… how can a lowly human…”

“How can a lowly spider…”

When I threw her words back at her, the spider scowled and raised two of her legs, likely intending to slam them down. But with Hwa-jeong’s power coursing through me, I was operating at a level far beyond normal. Raising my sword, I swung once. To others, it might look like an ordinary strike, but the force of the wave within it was undeniable.

The mana-infused wave shot toward the legs Vivian had raised.

“*Kiaaaaaaa!*”

In an instant, her legs were severed. The entire sequence happened in less than a second, leaving her no time to counter. Vivian let out a piercing scream and stumbled back, frantically spewing venom and threads in a desperate attack. There was a certain pathos to her assault, driven not just by pain but by sheer desperation.

I could have let her attacks hit me without issue, but I deliberately swung my sword to deflect them. My defense was simple: I brushed aside her threads and let her venom pass through me. Against such straightforward attacks, using the refined techniques of my advanced swordsmanship felt like an insult to the principles of Taiji.

But for Vivian, it must have felt like a nightmare. She was pouring everything she had into her attacks, yet I advanced without retreating, never breaking my stride. My sword flashed brilliantly in all directions, weaving a dance of light. Her threads fell to the ground, and her venom sailed past me harmlessly.

With every step I took forward, Vivian took a step back. I opened my mouth with a mocking smile.

“You’re supposed to be an alchemist, right? Isn’t this attack a bit too simplistic? The title of Ancient Alchemist is crying, Vivian. Say something. Haha.”

Vivian’s expression was frantic. She was too overwhelmed to even register my taunts, sweating profusely. It seemed she had exhausted her reserves of venom and threads, as her face paled visibly. She strained to produce more, but only a few thin strands came out.

“*Ki…! Krrk…! Krrk-krrk…!*”

Grunting in frustration, Vivian glanced at the ceiling and began scrambling up the wall. Watching her climb, I leaped up, running along the wall myself.

“Let’s go together.”

Vivian, who had been frantically climbing, gasped when she saw me hot on her heels and, in a moment of disgrace, fell to the floor. A spider falling from the ceiling—seriously? Do I look *that* terrifying?

“Ugh…”

A groan came from beneath the spider, and I paused, hanging upside down in the air, intrigued. Unfortunately, it seemed a female user had fallen with her. It looked like the user had cushioned Vivian’s fall, as Jeong Ji-yeon’s once-rounded belly was now sunken in. Green beads, burst open here and there, rolled across the floor. It appeared Vivian’s fall had unintentionally crushed Jeong Ji-yeon’s abdomen, forcing the beads out. It wasn’t a pleasant sight, and I grimaced.

With an irritated expression, Vivian shoved Jeong Ji-yeon aside and, as if struck by a sudden idea, wrapped her legs around the user and lifted her toward me. A gleam of hope crossed her face—she must have thought she’d come up with something clever. I waited patiently to hear what she had to say, descending lightly to the ground. As soon as I landed, Vivian raised the leg holding Jeong Ji-yeon high.

“Hey… you’re human too, right?”

“Yup.”

“Come any closer, and I’ll kill this woman.”

“…*Sigh*.”

I let out an audible sigh. Seeing my reaction, Vivian’s face lit up with relief, and she licked her lips. I looked calmly at Jeong Ji-yeon’s pain-twisted face. Her eyes were fixed on me, radiating a desperate longing.

“*Hee… hee*. How about you put down that sword?”

“Sure thing.”

I gently placed my sword on the ground. Vivian, who had been skeptical, smiled thinly upon seeing my compliance. Ignoring her, I closed the distance between us. With every step I took, Vivian flinched, thrusting Jeong Ji-yeon’s body closer, almost right in front of me. …Is she an idiot?

Jeong Ji-yeon and I locked eyes. I felt no guilt. I’ve killed users before, so this wasn’t new. Still, as a small gesture of apology, I gave a slight nod before reaching for her pale neck.

“I didn’t say you could come closer…?”

My hand closed around her slender neck.

“Get… your hand… off…?”

*Crunch. Snap!*

“*Urk… gah…*”

I twisted, and with my Strength stat at 94, snapping a frail female user’s neck was effortless. The sensation of her bones shattering pulsed through my hand. Jeong Ji-yeon bit her tongue and died instantly. The human-faced spider gaped in disbelief, her mouth working soundlessly. Savoring her stunned expression, I leaped off the ground, landing lightly beside her face. I patted her head gently and spoke.

“Idiot. If you’re going to take a hostage, grab someone I care about. What’s the point of holding some random human?”

“B-But… we’re both humans… how could you…?”

“It’s annoying, and she’s in the way. Plus, she’s got nothing to do with me. Live or die, I don’t care.”

“Even so! How can you kill a person so carelessly? Are you really human?”

“It’s weird hearing *you* say that. Oh, and stop sneaking those legs toward my friends. I’ll rip them off.”

I gave a cold smile as a warning, and Vivian, startled, quickly retracted her legs. How suspicious. I was now perched atop her body, and she was sweating profusely, looking utterly lost.

My hand was ablaze with vermilion flames—the mana infused with Hwa-jeong’s power. Taking down a boss monster like this for my debut didn’t seem like a bad idea. Perhaps excited at the prospect of fighting a proper monster after so long, I exuded a thick, palpable killing intent. How should I kill her?

Vivian met my gaze and quickly looked away, her lips trembling as she seemed to sense the vast gap between us. She must have realized I was contemplating her fate, as her face took on a look of despair. Yet, she clearly still wanted to live—her trembling body and furtive glances at me were proof of that.

As for my thoughts on using my power this time… honestly, I was a bit surprised myself. I knew I’d win, but I hadn’t expected it to be *this* easy. Even if it’s just a small city’s outskirts, she’s still a dungeon master, a boss monster. So this is what it feels like to wield such power.

“*Urk!*”

I must have unconsciously tightened my grip, as Vivian’s face contorted sharply. She kept glancing at me nervously, then swallowed hard and opened her mouth.

“Hey.”

“Yeah?”

“Let me live.”

“?”

What kind of nonsense was this? I scratched my head a couple of times, giving her a dubious look.

“No way…”

“Please, let me live. I’m begging you.”

“…You’re a dungeon master and a boss monster. Don’t you have any pride?”

“Who cares about that? Living is what matters most. Please, spare me.”

“…”

Seeing her completely shift her demeanor, her eyes sparkling with desperate pleas, I was momentarily taken aback but soon accepted it. The Hall Plane isn’t a game—whether human, animal, or creature, once you die, that’s it. For an intelligent being like her, the desire to survive was only natural.

“Still, begging for your life so easily? That’s kind of pathetic. Come on, let’s fight a bit more. Who knows? Maybe you’ll win…”

“No way. I have a bad feeling that if I keep fighting you, I’ll die horribly without even putting up a fight. I’ll give you something good. Please, spare me. I’m begging you.”

She’s got good instincts. I had indeed planned to crush her the moment she made another move. But after climbing atop her, I sensed no hostility from her—only submission, perhaps. Her offer of “something good” piqued my interest, and my eyes lit up.

“Something good?”

“Yeah, yeah. You came here for my treasures, right? Among other reasons, I’m sure.”

“Hmm.”

I stroked my chin, feigning deep thought, and Vivian quickly flattened herself to the ground, almost like a puppy wagging its tail for its master. For now, I decided to graciously accept whatever she was offering.

“What are you giving me? You know a life comes at a steep price.”

“Everything. I’ll give you everything. Let’s go to my workshop. You can look around, and if you like what you see, spare me. The workshop’s just past this passage.”

“Alright, fine. By the way, the others… they’ll be okay for a while like that, right?”

“I don’t care either way, but… yeah, don’t worry. There are a couple of humans still alive in there. I caught them yesterday, and they’re still breathing!”

I felt a twinge of guilt looking at the three cocooned in silk. But as I nodded, the spider turned her bulky body and scuttled out of the passage with surprising speed, carrying me on her back.
