# Memorize - Episode 4 (4/1068): Using the Privilege

『An unknown energy is making your Strength even stronger. Strength slightly increases.』  
『An unknown energy is making your Agility even stronger. Agility slightly increases.』  
『The magic power within you is surging explosively! It’s almost uncontrollable! Magic Power greatly increases!』  
『The Goddess of Luck is smiling upon you! She has a deep interest in you! Luck greatly increases!』  

Reading the messages, I realized I couldn’t expect significant boosts to Strength or Agility. That was unavoidable. Even if Strength was one thing, my Agility of 96 points was already among the highest in the Hall Plane. But Magic Power and Luck? Those were something to look forward to. Though the messages had an event-like flair, the appearance of special notifications was promising.  

“It’s been a while since I’ve felt this kind of excitement. It’s a shame Stamina didn’t increase, though…”  

I hadn’t even considered receiving privileges at the start, so this was already a massive gain. Trying to calm my racing heart, I immediately updated my Player Status window.

“Strength up by 8 points, Agility up by 2 points, Magic Power up by 42 points, Luck up by 52 points. A total increase of 104 points.”  

Not bad. Very good, actually. My previously lackluster stats now shone with impressive numbers, enough to make my eyes widen.  

Yet, despite the situation calling for celebration, my Stamina stat nagged at me. Compared to the other stats, it left a lingering sense of dissatisfaction.  

“If only Stamina had gone up instead of Luck…”  

Stamina is the cornerstone—or root—of all other stats, its importance undeniable. If Magic Power is the engine of a car, Stamina is the chassis. My current Stamina of 78 points was frustratingly average.  

“It’s decent enough for output, I suppose… Sigh.”  

Human greed knows no bounds. Even with these vastly improved stats, I couldn’t shake the lingering discontent.  

Still, I decided to set my complaints aside. There were more privileges to claim, and dawdling wasn’t my style.  

“User Kim Su-hyeon, would you like to proceed to the next privilege?”  

“Hm. Let’s do—wait, hold on.”  

I almost nodded absentmindedly but caught myself, shaking my head. Stats were out of my control, but from here on, I could choose and shape my path. Every decision needed careful consideration.  

“Seraph, how much time is left until the Rite of Passage?”  

“One hour, forty-two minutes, and twenty-three seconds.”  

“Alright, give me a moment to think. Thirty minutes… no, ten minutes will do.”  

“As you wish.”  

I closed my eyes and sank into thought.  

In the Hall Plane, I was a strong contender. My strength had allowed me to seize the Zero Code. I had the qualifications to be called a powerhouse, but I knew I wasn’t the “best” or the “strongest.” Those titles were far from me. My low Magic Power had always held me back.  

Now, with my Magic Power issue resolved, I might have reached my limit—or close to it. Despite my Year 0 designation, my body was essentially that of a Year 10 veteran, loaded with past rewards, equipment, and elixirs. Raising stats through standard training was nearly impossible now.  

That didn’t mean I was at a disadvantage. Most users’ growth stalled between 70 and 80 points, so my current stats were luxurious by comparison.  

“But that’s only for the average case.”  

There are always exceptions—those who defy expectations. Some users start with stats exceeding 70 points. Moving forward, I had to think on their level. The miracles and coincidences from my first cycle weren’t guaranteed to repeat. To achieve my goals, I needed the strength to match.  

I opened my eyes. Seraph was still perched on the altar, waiting for my words. Looking at her, I spoke quietly.  

“Seraph, I’d like to request class selection for the next privilege.”  

“Yes. User Kim Su-hyeon’s request has been received. You are granted priority to choose a class before entering the Rite of Passage and the Hall Plane. Additionally, all secret classes will be temporarily revealed.”  

Class selection is a process reserved for those who must prove their worth. Normally, it happens after surviving the Rite of Passage, in the Summoning Room before entering the Hall Plane. I was skipping those steps, diving straight into character setup.  

I planned to choose a sword-related class again. My boosted Magic Power opened other options, and I’d considered them briefly, but the sword path felt right. It was a road I’d traveled before—a shortcut I didn’t need to reinvent.  

A dense chart of information materialized in the air. Without hesitation, I dismissed the Rare class chart and began carefully reviewing the Secret class chart.  

『Class List (Secret)』  
[War Mage]  
[Field Maestro]  
[Requiem Assassin]  
[Soul Commander]  
[Jewel Mage]  
[Copy Archimage]  
[Death Knight]  
[Brilliance Priest]  
[…]  

“Not this one… not that one either… Hm… I’m sure the class that guy had was…”  

Were there always this many Secret classes? The sheer number left me momentarily speechless. Struggling to find what I wanted, I decided to ask Seraph for help before I wasted more time.  

“Seraph, can you filter the Secret classes to show only sword-related ones?”  

“That’s not difficult. Are you planning to choose a sword-related Secret class?”  

“If I am?”  

“I recommend it. An excellent choice. Please wait a moment, and I’ll filter them for you.”  

My focus on class selection was tied to Special and Potential Abilities. Stats determine the class, and the class determines the abilities. That was my order of priority. Since I had my sights set on a Unique Ability, I needed to prepare for the two randomly assigned Potential Abilities.  

“The filtering is complete. I’ll display the chart.”  

“Alright.”  

I began carefully examining the filtered classes. I wanted a class suited to countering mages. In my first cycle, my low Magic Power and Luck made fighting mages a constant struggle, leaving me with chills even now.  

“Found it.”  

As the list reached its midpoint, I finally spotted the classes I was looking for.  

[Sword Specialist]  
[Spell Sniper]  

Each Secret class comes with a unique “Authority.” Both classes had appeared in my first cycle, and their power was undeniable.  

The Sword Specialist’s Authority grants advantages in all sword-related actions and the ability to cut through anything in existence. The Spell Sniper’s Authority offers a chance to completely resist magic from users with Magic Power of 75 or less, reduces damage by 80% for Magic Power of 85 or less, and by 50% for Magic Power of 90 or less.  

Had I chosen a class without thinking, I’d have picked Spell Sniper without hesitation. Combining its Authority with the Potential Ability of Magic Resistance could render most mages ineffective, save for the rare archmage pushing the limits of Magic Power.  

But after reflection, my heart leaned heavily toward Sword Specialist. The Authority to cut anything was an irresistible allure. I recalled a user who wielded Sword Specialist in my first cycle. His prowess was extraordinary—slicing through spells, cutting, and neutralizing them. Mages fell before him like leaves in a storm.  

Spell Sniper was tempting, but Sword Specialist was no less impressive.  

“…”  

After much deliberation, I made my choice: Sword Specialist. It was a risky decision, but I felt strangely liberated as I spoke in a clear voice.  

“I’ll go with Sword Specialist.”  

“Sword Specialist? It’s not a bad choice, but Spell Sniper is also quite formidable. Given your current Magic Power, few mages could harm you.”  

“That’s true.”  

“Then why…?”  

“Because, as you said, there are still mages who could.”  

“…”  

Seraph’s expression showed her disapproval, and for a moment, I wavered. But I steadied myself and spoke with conviction.  

“Let me give you an example. Imagine a targeted system with guaranteed success versus a non-targeted system that depends on control. The former has clear limits, even if it’s safer. The latter’s efficiency depends purely on my skill. You get what I mean, right?”  

“I understand.”  

“Then it’s Sword Specialist.”  

“As you wish.”  

Seraph paused, as if considering, then nodded once. A message confirmed the update.  

『Congratulations. You have obtained the Secret Class: Sword Specialist. Your Player Status has been updated.』  

The message left me oddly relieved. Clearing the first hurdle smoothly eased my mind. But I couldn’t relax yet. The next privilege involved elements beyond my full control, so I steeled myself again.  

“3. A privilege regarding Special and Potential Abilities will be granted. Normally, users receive one Special Ability slot and four Potential Ability slots, but for User Kim Su-hyeon, an additional Potential Ability slot will be opened. All hidden Special and Potential Abilities will be revealed, and you may choose as desired.  

Alternatively, you can unlock a ‘Unique Ability’ slot. A Unique Ability is a higher-tier ability above Special Abilities. If you forgo the Unique Ability, you may choose one Special Ability and all five Potential Abilities. (In this case, the additional slot is automatically included in Potential Abilities.)”  

I carefully mulled over the information.  

Special and Potential Abilities typically manifest based on a user’s alignment. Starting with pre-selected abilities was a massive advantage, setting me apart from other users. But that made careful selection even more critical.  

Special and Potential Abilities are paramount in determining a character’s effectiveness. Choosing abilities that align with your class strengthens you significantly. Conversely, mismatched abilities diminish your class’s potential. To grow stronger, stats, class, and abilities must harmonize.  

“Seraph, let’s proceed with ability assignment for the next privilege.”  

“Yes. Please specify whether you wish to activate the Unique Ability slot. The implications are…”  

“I know. I’ll go with activating the Unique Ability.”  

“Understood. One Potential Ability slot will be consumed. Of the remaining four slots, two will be randomly assigned.”  

I had confidence. Just as stat increases were influenced by a user’s growth, ability assignments followed a similar principle. Given my body’s history as a Sword Master, there was a high chance the two random Potential Abilities would include ones I had in my first cycle.  

While I calculated internally, Seraph signaled she was ready.  

“I have loaded the charts for Unique, Special, and Potential Abilities. Would you like to make selections first, or open the two Potential Ability slots first?”  

A flicker of unease lingered, but it was better to face the unknown sooner. I decided to open the two Potential Ability slots first.  

“I’ll open the two Potential Ability slots first.”
