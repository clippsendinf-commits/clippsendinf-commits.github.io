# Chapter 108: Same Question, Different Result

Her poignant voice echoed softly. I closed my eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. To others, it might have seemed like I was collecting my thoughts, but it was merely an act for show. After steadying my breath, I began speaking in a resolute tone.

“I’ve experienced the loss of people dear to me.”

I had wrestled with whether to say this, but in the end, I decided to go through with it. The chances of her connecting this to User Jeong Ji-yeon were slim. Now was the time to answer her question, and judging by the flow of the *Crystal of Truth* in my hand, its duration was about to run out.

“The feeling back then was indescribably sorrowful and despairing. After that experience, and after being dragged into this damned Hall Plane, I kept recalling those memories, pushing myself to the brink to grow stronger and adapt.”

“…”

“I wanted to grow stronger, and even though I knew the power could be deadly, I accepted it… because, quite simply, I wanted to survive. My ultimate goals are twofold: survival and return. I still hold onto the hope of surviving in this Hall Plane world and returning to Earth. But… going back alone would be meaningless.”

I paused and turned my head to look at the kids. An-hyeon’s face, An-sol’s face, and Yu-jeong’s face came into view. They were listening intently, their breaths uneven with focus. Of course, the truly precious people in my heart weren’t these kids.

This was, at its core, a vague game of words and sincerity. I turned my gaze back and continued.

“I want to protect those dear to me and not let them die. I want us to survive and return to Earth together, without a single death. Even if it means sacrificing myself, if I can save those precious to me, I’ll accept that sacrifice calmly.”

“Hyung…”

“Oppa…”

“Orabeoni…”

The light of the *Crystal of Truth* remained faint, steadily glowing. It had to be—because I spoke those words thinking of my older brother, Kim Yu-hyeon, and Han So-yeong. The *Crystal of Truth* judged my heartfelt words as true.

That was my true sentiment, but the group around me mistook those “precious people” for the kids. Especially those who met my gaze wore expressions mixed with awe and dreaminess. Sorry, kids. But I’ll make sure you never regret following me.

Jeong Ha-yeon, Shin Sang-yong, and Vivian were staring at me with faces full of admiration. The *Crystal of Truth* had proven my words weren’t empty. I had said all I wanted to say. But the crystal was still active. Since I finished speaking earlier than expected, I was about to rack my brain for what to do next when Shin Sang-yong, who had been quietly listening, spoke up.

“Ha-yeon-ssi. Let’s stop now.”

“W-What…?”

“You’ve asked enough questions. Let’s call it quits. And Leader.”

Shin Sang-yong suddenly paused, adjusted his posture, and, before I could stop him, bowed deeply, pressing his forehead to the floor. A sharp *thud* echoed as he hit the ground with some force.

“Leader. I’m sorry. For a moment, I doubted you. That’s why I didn’t stop Ha-yeon-ssi when she brought out the *Crystal of Truth*. But after hearing your sincerity… I realized how foolish I was.”

“I’m glad the misunderstanding is cleared.”

“You’re my savior, and you granted my request. Yet I couldn’t shake the doubts in my heart. I’m truly sorry.”

“I’ll make sure you pay for this back in Mul. Now get up. You’re making me uncomfortable.”

As I spoke in a somber tone, Shin Sang-yong struggled to his feet, his face filled with regret. When I turned my gaze, I saw Jeong Ha-yeon staring blankly at him. Starting with Shin Sang-yong, she scanned the faces of everyone in the group, pausing briefly on Vivian. In that moment, I caught a fleeting glint in her eyes.

“Su…!”

“Kids.”

I quickly turned slightly and addressed the kids in a gentle tone. Jeong Ha-yeon, who had been about to speak, flinched and swallowed hard. She had just said her last question was final, and the atmosphere wasn’t right for her to press me further. Even the kind-hearted Shin Sang-yong had told her to stop, his tone tinged with irritation. If she spoke again, she’d surely incur the wrath of the entire group.

The kids looked hesitant, their mouths moving wordlessly. With a calm expression I hadn’t shown Jeong Ha-yeon, I spoke up.

“If any of you have questions you’ve been curious about, ask now. We still have a bit of time.”

At my prompt, An-hyeon and Yu-jeong immediately shook their heads. No, don’t do that—if you don’t ask, we’ll have time left over! They couldn’t hear my inner plea, of course, and responded in shy tones.

“Hyung, all my doubts are cleared. I never doubted you to begin with. I’m… sorry, and thank you, Hyung.”

“Me too, me too! See, I knew it! How could our Oppa ever deceive us… Poor Oppa, what do we do…”

I sighed as Yu-jeong trailed off, pouting. If it came to it, I figured I could rely on Shin Sang-yong or Vivian to fill the time. I turned to An-sol, who had been staring at me with dreamy eyes since earlier.

I instinctively sensed danger(?) and was about to turn to Vivian when—

“Um… Orabeoni…”

“Y-Yes?”

“I have something I want to ask Orabeoni…”

Don’t. Please don’t. I desperately wanted to say it, but if I did, she’d burst into tears on the spot. Besides, the other kids seemed genuinely curious about her question, and I couldn’t find a good reason to refuse. Taking my silence as approval, Sol twisted her body shyly and finally spoke.

“Orabeoni… what do you think of me…?”

“Cough, cough!”

An-hyeon, who had been listening quietly, let out a violent fake cough. I bit my lip, realizing the moment I dreaded had arrived. Haha, what do I think? I think you’re a childish kid who always makes me want to tease you and make you cry… But I couldn’t say that out loud.

“…”

Sol, her cheeks flushed and hands tightly clasped, looked like she’d mustered all her courage. I was about to give a vague answer when unexpected support came.

“What do you mean, ‘what does he think’? You’re always acting childish, causing trouble, and crying at the drop of a hat. Why would you ask something that puts Oppa on the spot?”

“Yeah, look at how uncomfortable Su-hyeon looks. Ask that kind of question in private, or don’t ask it at all. Learn to read the room.”

Yu-jeong and Vivian tag-teamed, sharply targeting Sol. I nodded inwardly at their spot-on remarks, though their tones were unnecessarily sharp. At their retorts, Sol pushed out her lower lip.

“I wasn’t asking you, Unnis.”

“You little brat—”

“Enough.”

With a low voice, I made Yu-jeong, who was about to stand, sit back down. Things had almost taken a strange turn, but their timely intervention saved me. With everyone’s attention on me, I spoke calmly.

“Sol is a kind and pure kid. Sometimes, she surprises me with how pure she is. But… that purity doesn’t quite fit with the world of Hall Plane. That’s the truth.”

“Hee…”

“But Sol is a priest, right? I always see potential in her, rather than thinking of her as a burden.”

“But… like the Unnis said, I’m not much help, always whining and crying…”

You know yourself well. But I didn’t show it and slowly shook my head.

“Your personality and the priest class go so well together. I believe you have the potential to become the greatest priest. No, if you keep that heart of yours, you *will* become the greatest priest.”

Exactly. You’re destined to become the *Priest of Radiance* someday. You’ll be incredibly useful then, so for now, I’ll keep coaxing and comforting you. Smiling softly, I lifted the *Crystal of Truth*. Its flame still burned faintly.

Hearing my firm assurance, Sol’s face visibly brightened, and An-hyeon straightened up with an excited expression. At that moment, I noticed the flame of the *Crystal of Truth*, held aloft, beginning to fade.

“Ah…”

I turned at the sound of a gasp. Jeong Ha-yeon was looking at the *Crystal of Truth* in my hand with a flustered expression. The flame, which had been steadily waning, had now shrunk to a mere speck. Cracks began to form on the crystal’s surface.

*Crack. Crackle. Shatter…*

The cracks spread rapidly, and soon the crystal crumbled into a handful of dust, scattering into the air. Jeong Ha-yeon stared blankly as the dust fell. When it was all gone, she looked up at me with complex emotions in her eyes.

Having overcome the critical moment with impeccable timing, I let out a deep breath. Switching from the gentle expression I’d shown the kids, I addressed her in an indifferent tone.

“So… are all your questions answered?”

“…Yes.”

Her reply came a beat late, but it was a “yes.” Answering while touching the *Crystal of Truth* would have been tricky, but now that its duration was over, I had plenty of room to maneuver. Plus, I had a good excuse everyone already knew about.

In any case, I felt an immense sense of relief at wrapping up this important matter. On top of that, I’d dealt with that damned Belphegor, making today truly the best day. But there was one more thing to feel good about.

“As of this moment, I’ll resume my role as the caravan leader.”

“No objections here.”

Nodding once at Shin Sang-yong’s clear response, I stood up.

“We’ve rested longer than planned, so let’s get moving. Everyone, up.”

At my command, the group rose from their seats. Jeong Ha-yeon let out a sigh of unknown meaning and cautiously stood. I approached her and whispered in a low voice.

“We’ll settle this matter when we get back to Mul. Until then…”

“…I understand. And I’m sorry.”

After her firm acknowledgment, I turned away. Yu-jeong, wearing a brighter smile than ever, rushed toward me.

“Oppa, are we heading back to Mul now? If we leave today, we’ll get there in a couple of days, right?”

“No, including today, it’ll take about three days.”

“Huh? Why?”

“It’s a bit late already. And we might spend one more night in the lab. Just so you know.”

At my words, the group looked at me with puzzled expressions. I pointed toward the door and continued.

“When I was fighting Belphegor earlier, I found a secret passage.”

“A secret passage?”

“Yeah. When I spotted him on the first floor, he was frantically scratching at the floor. There’s probably a door leading underground somewhere. We’ve already got plenty, but you never know. There might be even greater treasure in that secret place.”

At that, the kids’ faces lit up with intrigue—except for one. An-sol was the exception. She approached me, grabbed my clothes with both hands, and clung tightly.

“Orabeoni… can’t we just go back to Mul? I’m so worried about you…”

I gently patted her cheek. Her soft, still baby-fat-filled cheeks felt tender in my hand.

“It’d be a shame to come this far and leave empty-handed. It’s fine. I was planning to rest for a while once we get back to Mul anyway.”

“…Really?”

“Yeah. So let’s go for now. It’s not that hard, right? We’ve already cleared the place.”

“Okay…”

I patted the head of Sol, who obediently listened, and turned to leave. The group had already formed up. After checking everyone’s faces, I strode confidently toward the door. As I stepped out, a deep smile spread across my face.
