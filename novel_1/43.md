# Memorize - Chapter 42: Make an Offer

Anyway, I had planned to casually bring up the topic over drinks tonight if the opportunity arose. Besides, since it was highly likely that Han-byeol and I would part ways, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to reveal a bit of my true intentions. If I had known it would come to this, I wouldn’t have spoken so vaguely in front of the cabin. A belated sense of regret crept in, but it was clear that both of our feelings had changed.

“Why… is it hard to explain?”  
“Is it… hard to explain to *me*?”  

As Han-byeol emphasized the word *me*, I shook my head. That wasn’t what I meant.  

“That’s not it. Do you remember the conversation we had in front of the cabin steps?”  
“…Yes.”  
“For the past three months… I’ve had a lot of time to think. Seeing the world of Hall Plane changed my perspective somewhat. Anyway, I’m not joining the Golden Lion Clan or any other clan for that matter.”  

Though I trailed off slightly, Han-byeol was sharp as ever. She chewed over my words for a moment before looking at me with surprised eyes. It seemed she had grasped my intentions.  

“So… you’re saying you’re thinking of starting a new clan?”  
“Something like that. I’m considering creating a clan. The others didn’t get offers from the Golden Lion Clan, you know. But more than that, I wanted to stick together with them from the start.”  
“I also…”  

The moment I finished, Han-byeol started to say something reflexively but quickly closed her mouth. I could sense her breathing grow slightly ragged. A conflicted expression clouded her face. Biting her lip, she seemed to make up her mind and spoke in a louder voice than usual.  

“I feel the same. Comparing how I felt before and after coming to Hall Plane, my thoughts have changed a lot. You were amazing during the Rite of Passage, oppa. Even at the User Academy, you proved you’re different from everyone else. I know better than anyone how capable you are. But…”  

*But*. That was the signal that she was about to say what she really wanted to tell me. I focused on her words with a calm expression.  

“Hall Plane is a vast and boundless world. Anything can happen anywhere—it’s that kind of place. It’s not a space where one person’s strength can do everything, like it did during the Rite of Passage. You might say you’re not alone, that you have three others.”  

I was about to say just that but closed my mouth and nodded instead. Han-byeol, now with her usual cool composure restored, fixed her gaze on me and continued.  

“I’m not saying you should or shouldn’t do it. I’m not trying to speak ill of you either. But… I still think, even if you deny it, you’re trying to carry everything on your own. In Hall Plane, a group relying on just one person is too dangerous.”  

Han-byeol wasn’t underestimating the abilities of the other three. Rather, she was pointing out my attitude in relation to theirs. In essence, she was saying that one person alone can’t accomplish anything—a point that had some merit. But she was overlooking one thing.  

Having said her piece, she let out a deep breath. I took a moment to gather my thoughts while giving her a chance to catch her breath. Then, I slowly spoke.  

“You have a pretty stubborn streak, Han-byeol.”  
“…?”  
“It’s good to think rationally, but you tend to go too far in one direction.”  
“What are you talking about all of a sudden?”  
“I’m saying don’t judge me or the others so carelessly based on your own standards.”  

Surprised by the cold edge in my voice—something she hadn’t heard from me before—Han-byeol quickly shut her mouth. I fixed her with a chilly stare. Her lips trembled slightly, and though I felt a pang of pity for her reaction, I had already decided to treat her as just another user. I would say what needed to be said.  

“That’s… I’m sorry. But I thought we were similar, oppa. Always rational…”  
“Similar? You might think that, but to me, joining a clan—especially the Golden Lion Clan—isn’t a rational choice.”  
“…Why not? Are you saying I’m wrong?”  
“Is it about being right or wrong? Every choice has its pros and cons. Isn’t the rational thing to weigh those and make the best decision based on your situation and those around you?”  

Kim Han-byeol had made a rational choice based on the present. I had made a rational choice based on the past and the future. It was a simple truth, yet Han-byeol looked confused. For the first time, I felt a heavy frustration in my chest as I looked at her. We weren’t understanding each other.  

“The Golden Lion Clan is the greatest clan in the Northern Continent. It’s an open secret that they’ve already established a foundation and are preparing to advance into the Steel Mountains. Starting from scratch is completely different from joining them. I just don’t see what advantages there are in the path you’re choosing.”  

“Who says their advance into the Steel Mountains will succeed? They might be offering executive positions, but have you thought about what that really means? More importantly, do you genuinely believe the people in the clan you’re about to join are trustworthy?”  

My tone was sharp, almost biting, but Han-byeol listened in silence. A brief pause hung between us, and a cold atmosphere settled in. Just as I was about to continue after a moment’s hesitation, she spoke first.  

“Then, oppa, are you saying *you’re* someone trustworthy?”  

…  

One sentence. Just one sentence. With that single sentence, the subtle chill between us turned into a piercing silence. The only sounds were our breaths. Her face was a whirlwind of emotions—resentment, sadness, regret, and more. It was the first time I’d seen her display such a range of feelings since we met.  

I spoke quietly, but my words carried an unmistakable sense of disappointment.  

“You said to me back then, ‘Why are you acting like this, oppa?’ If I were to answer that now… I…”  

I.  

“Back then, I wanted to be a shield for all of you. I wanted to give you trust and be trusted in return. By nature, I don’t trust people easily. I’ve even considered going it alone. But, as you said, I know full well that one person can’t do everything. I couldn’t ignore that fact.”  

I took a deep breath and continued.  

“So, once I made that decision, I wanted to choose the people I’d start with. People who trust me. People I can trust. It’s a clan, after all. When forming a clan… I hoped there’d be at least one or two people who felt like family.”  

As I spoke, Han-byeol’s eyes shook violently. Her lips quivered as if she wanted to say something, but by then, the massive information hall building loomed before us.  

Once before, she and I had stood at a fork in the road. Back then, she followed my choice. Now, we were at another fork, and I had already chosen my direction. She hadn’t yet.  

I calmly climbed the steps and grasped the handle of the entrance door. Han-byeol still hadn’t moved. With a gentle push, the door opened smoothly without a creak. I stepped inside slowly.  

And I didn’t hear Han-byeol follow.  

*  

An-hyeon and the others had already thrown themselves into a lively drinking session. I couldn’t bring up the conversation I’d planned. Watching them laugh and joke, I sighed inwardly. These guys wouldn’t understand how I felt even if their lives depended on it. It made me feel a bit petty and annoyed. Such carefree kids.  

Still, I didn’t let it show. Days like this might not come again. From tomorrow, the path we were taking would be anything but easy—a thorny road. In comparison, the User Academy would feel like paradise. I was going to push them hard, no question.  

The drinking session ended with a bang (or so it seemed). An-hyeon and Yu-jeong got carried away, letting loose completely. Thankfully, Sol-i was still sober, so we managed to carry them back to the lodging, one by one. After tossing An-hyeon into a corner, I lay down and sank into thought.  

Now that I’d entered Hall Plane and my perspective had shifted, there was so much to do. First, I needed to collect the mission reward points tomorrow and leave Barbara immediately. As I mulled over various plans, I drifted off to sleep.  

The next morning arrived.  

The graduation and departure ceremony were, frankly, quite dull. There was a lot of talk, but it boiled down to “You worked hard, and we hope you’ll be active in the Northern Continent.”  

『You have completed the User Academy in the great city of Barbara in the Northern Continent. You have been awarded 4 stat points as a mission reward.』  

After the graduation ceremony and receiving the reward points, the users’ paths clearly diverged. Those who received offers joined the welcoming clan members, while the rest were left twiddling their thumbs.  

Even if they didn’t stay in the big city, there were clans in regular or smaller cities they could join. Seeing some linger aimlessly after the ceremony, I felt a bit of pity. But it wasn’t my concern.  

My first instinct was to rush to the warehouse to pick up the items I’d bought with GP, but the kids swarmed me, ruining that plan. An-hyeon, Yu-jeong, and Sol-i. With the four of us together, I could feel the eyes of clan scouts on us. I’d already politely declined all offers, but it seemed some still hadn’t given up.  

An-hyeon’s potential was overshadowed by me, Woo Jeong-min, and Seon Yu-un, but he’d shown enough to make clans salivate. Yu-jeong’s grades were above average, too. Both had received numerous offers from mid-tier clans but turned them down because of me.  

Honestly, Sol-i was the real treasure. *Brilliance Priest*. The ultimate priest class, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the Princess of Execution and the Shadow Queen as one of the top female users. Even if she didn’t obtain that class, her starting stats—75 Magic and 100 Luck—were incredible advantages.  

Surprisingly, Sol-i didn’t attract much attention. According to An-hyeon, she struggled to control her magic. It was unusual for a novice user to handle mid-to-high-level magic power. But as she grew more accustomed, her true potential would shine.  

The Golden Lion Clan’s scout looked at the users with disbelief. I later learned they’d made offers to five new users this time, but only two accepted.  

“Sorry, I have comrades I’ve been with all this time. I’m not going to leave them and join alone.”  

After smoothly turning down the final scout, An-hyeon and the others seemed to feel guilty, probably taking my words at face value. It wasn’t a bad misunderstanding, but it left me uneasy, so I decided I’d clear things up when the chance came.  

As we stepped out of the academy’s main gate, the outside was bustling with new and veteran users. I spotted the Golden Lion Clan members among others, their clan emblems standing out.  

Then, a particular scene caught my eye. It was Lee Ji-yeong. She must have joined a fairly well-known clan, judging by the smug look on her face as she glanced at the users who didn’t get offers. Arms crossed beside an instructor, she was putting on quite a show. I couldn’t help but think how obnoxious she was. I was curious to see how her expression would change in six months, but I turned away.  

Suddenly, it occurred to me that Kim Han-byeol was somewhere out there. I could feel a piercing gaze on my face. When I turned in its direction, sure enough, I saw her staring at me and my group. But I no longer wanted to linger on her. It seemed the fact that she was a Jewel Mage hadn’t spread yet, likely kept secret within her clan for now.  

The kids followed me, their faces full of anticipation. Just as I was about to hurry away, a voice called out, forcing me to stop. Turning, I saw Woo Jeong-min and his group. From his greeting—“So, you didn’t join either”—I could guess who the other two who rejected the Golden Lion Clan’s offer were. (Not that I hadn’t already suspected.)  

During a brief chat, Woo Jeong-min suggested we act together for a while. Honestly, it was tempting. Taking out their group before they could form the Red Fang Clan would make things easier. But before I could respond, Won Hye-su from his group and Yu-jeong from mine visibly bristled, and the idea fizzled out.  

Won Hye-su still hadn’t let go of her feelings toward me, occasionally shooting me glares. I understood her emotions, but there was a limit to my patience. If she kept acting like that, I wasn’t going to look kindly on her either. For now, I let it slide, but I made a mental note to deal with her attitude later. With that, we exchanged brief farewells.  

Looking back, the kids were staring at me with blank faces, having stopped when I did. They’d likely turned down decent clan offers to follow me blindly. They still acted like chicks following their mother, but I wanted to trust them to some extent.  

To do that, I needed to share my plans for the future first.
