# Chapter 56: Dungeon of Alchemist (2)

“Damn it! Wolves again, of all things!”  
“Stop grumbling and get into formation!”  

I swiftly stepped in front of An-sol, pulling An-hyeon’s arm to form a triangular formation. The number of wolves before us was staggering, too many to count at a glance, their sheer volume overwhelming. Their ferocious howls sent a prickling sensation across my skin.  

I bit my lip hard. The caravan’s trail had vanished without a trace. Normally, the deeper we went, the stronger the trail should have been, but it had abruptly cut off at some point. I’d wandered around, searching for any clue, but it was as if we’d been bewitched—nothing turned up. Just as I was about to activate my Third Eye, we were ambushed by the wolves, our luck turning sour.  

Even if these were the Black Forest wolves, I was confident I could handle over a hundred of them alone in my current state. The problem was the kids. They’d struggled against a pack of over twenty before, and now we were facing at least double that number. Though this wasn’t our first encounter with them, the sight of over forty wolves glaring at us with gleaming eyes was enough to terrify the kids, who were barely more than fledglings.  

“O-oppa…”  
“Don’t back away!”  

Despite my shout, Yu-jeong instinctively took a step back. The wolves seized the moment, letting out a unified howl. The sound of over forty beasts roaring in unison made An-hyeon, An-sol, and Yu-jeong flinch, their faces pale with fear. I heard An-hyeon muttering something beside me, but there was no time to ask as the wolves rapidly closed the distance between us.  

If this continued, we were done for. There was no time to reassure the kids. Yu-jeong and An-hyeon, momentarily dazed, snapped out of it and gripped their weapons tightly. It was a small relief that they’d regained their senses at the last moment, but the situation remained dire. Gritting my teeth, I drew my sword.  

“An-sol, support me with a protection spell and slowly retreat. I’m breaking formation from now on.”  

“Y-yes? Oppa? Oppa!”  

Without time to explain or convince her, I gripped my sword and charged forward. The wolves, seeing me surge ahead, bared their razor-sharp fangs. Screams echoed behind me, but this wasn’t a situation I could control with simple support. With this many enemies, there was no guarantee the kids could keep up. The only solution was to reveal a bit more of my strength.  

The first clash between me and the wolves began.  

With a single leap, I dove into the heart of their pack, swinging my mana-infused sword horizontally. The result was beyond my expectations, leaving even me stunned. The power of a Sword Specialist felt extraordinary. My years of sword training, combined with my special and potential abilities, created a synergy that unleashed a level of strength unlike anything before. With one slash, I sent six wolves flying, their blood spraying as they soared upward.  

“Protect!”  

An-sol’s perfectly timed protection spell enveloped me. The wolves, charging fiercely, hadn’t expected so many of their pack to fall in a single strike. They hesitated, staring at me in confusion. But their pause was brief. Perhaps emboldened by their numbers, four or five wolves split off toward the kids, while the remaining thirty swarmed me.  

I dispatched two wolves charging from both sides in an instant, then spun to slice through the torso of another leaping at me. Hot blood soaked my body. Glancing at the kids, I saw they’d pulled themselves together and were holding their own against the ferocious wolves. Still, too many remained. For the first time in a while, I was in a disadvantageous fight. With my sword lowered, I unleashed another powerful slash around me.  

“Kyeng!”  
*Shing!*  

Each swing was devastating, taking out two or three wolves at a minimum. A critical hit, like before, could fell six at once. My sword moved instinctively, following the optimal path as if guided by a current—Mind and Sword as One had activated.  

“Kyeng! Kang!”  
*Shing! Shing!*  

With consecutive swings, the wolves charging head-on were cleanly cleaved. As I turned to face a killing intent from behind, I felt something clamp onto my thigh. Looking down, I saw a wolf biting down hard, struggling against me.  

“Your teeth can’t pierce my endurance.”  

Whispering calmly, I thrust my sword downward, piercing its skull. Blood gushed from its head as it collapsed. With a quick kick to shake it off, I rampaged through the pack like a sword demon. After swinging my blade wildly for a while, I turned and noticed the battlefield had grown quiet.  

The fight had reached a lull. The pack, originally over forty strong, had dwindled to about eight. In that short time, over thirty wolves had been slaughtered. I’d gone a bit overboard in showing my strength.  

A dark smile crept across my face as the thrill of slaughter took hold. The remaining wolves whimpered and took a step back. As I stepped forward, they yelped and fled without looking back.  

*Where do you think you’re going?* Drunk on battle, I was about to chase them when urgent cries stopped me.  

“Hyung!”  
“Oppa!”  
“Oppa!”  

The kids’ voices snapped me back to reality. They hadn’t seen my smile, but this fight had been excessive. *What do I do? What do I say?* My mind raced.  

Then, as I lowered my head, I saw my blood-soaked body. Smelling the blood, an idea struck me. It was a bit pathetic to resort to acting, but I had no choice. My movements had been too extreme, and suspicion could sprout from the smallest things. Best to nip it in the bud.  

“Urgh!”  

“Hyung! Are you okay?”  

As the kids rushed toward me, I pretended to retch, collapsing to the ground. I made sure to breathe heavily, exaggerating my exhaustion. Vomiting blood would’ve been perfect, but that might’ve caused them to panic and insist on retreating.  

“Huff, huff!”  

Sweating profusely and grimacing in pain, I saw their panicked faces. An-hyeon was rummaging through his bag for a potion, An-sol was chanting a healing spell, and Yu-jeong was trying to strip off my clothes. *What’s she doing?*  

“Hyung! Hyung! Stay with us!”  
“Oppa! Oppa!”  
“Shh, quiet down…”  

As An-hyeon shoved a potion bottle toward my mouth, I shook my head and waved him off. Yu-jeong, having half-removed my shirt, peered closely at me, tilting her head.  

“What… no wounds? Did you hurt your lower body?”  

“Ugh… just stay still, all of you…”  

As I subtly circulated my mana, white mist rose from my body. I glanced at An-sol urgently, knowing a top student like her would notice. As she chanted her healing spell, her face paled at the sight of the mist.  

“Move!”  
“Eek! What’s wrong with her?”  
“I said move!”  

Yu-jeong flinched and stepped back at An-sol’s fierce glare, a look she’d never shown before. An-sol placed her hands on my chest, channeling mana to assess my condition. Seizing the moment, I surged my mana, laced with Hwa-jeong’s power, making it seem like I was on the verge of losing control.  

“No… impossible!”  
“What’s happening?”  
“My mana… it’s going berserk! It’s like a mana reversal!”  
“Mana reversal? Then…”  

“Wahhh!”  

An-sol burst into tears, clutching my face. Her warm tears and breath brushed against me. An-hyeon and Yu-jeong, aware of what a mana reversal meant, stared at me in shock.  

“Damn it… if I hadn’t frozen up…”  
“What do we do… what do we do…”  

“Quiet, all of you.”  

Feeling I’d played my part, I struggled to sit up, feigning effort. An-sol, An-hyeon, and Yu-jeong immediately looked at me, their eyes wide as if witnessing a miracle. Still emanating white mist, I sat cross-legged. The kids, understanding my intent, backed off.  

“Keep watch for a bit.”  

Nodding rapidly, they complied. I entered a meditative state, careful not to lose myself too deeply since time could slip away. Besides, I needed to use my Third Eye properly now.  

The trail had grown stronger before vanishing abruptly. The most likely cause was a barrier. But if it was a barrier, I should’ve sensed mana, yet there was none. It seemed to be a path-based barrier, not a reactive one.  

Activating my Third Eye, I meticulously scanned the surrounding forest.  

*  

“Hoo…”  

After finishing my analysis, I let out a long sigh. It wasn’t as draining as seeing *Truths* during the Rite of Passage, but it was far more taxing than simply reading information. Still, I’d found the vanished trail, which was a small comfort. Opening my eyes, I met two pairs of blinking eyes staring at me.  

*Blink.*  
*Blink, blink.*  
*Blink?*  
*Blink, blink?*  

“…”  

“Oppa?”  
“Oraboni?”  

An-hyeon, holding his spear with a fierce expression, was keeping watch. Hearing the kids call me, he turned, and our eyes met. His mouth slowly gaped open. I gently pushed away their hands, which were frantically touching my face, and stood up.  

“Oppa, are you okay? Your body?”  
“For now. I’ve suppressed it, so as long as I don’t overdo it, I’ll be fine.”  
“Hyung, here. Drink this.”  
“No, a stamina potion won’t help with mana reversal…”  

I wanted to say it was useless, but seeing An-hyeon’s face, I couldn’t refuse. Awkwardly, I accepted the potion. He seemed determined to make me drink it.  

As I uncorked the bottle and gulped it down, the kids’ heads bobbed up and down, mimicking my movements. Shrugging at their curious looks, Yu-jeong spoke with a crestfallen expression.  

“Um… Oppa, maybe we should turn back for now.”  
“Don’t talk nonsense.”  
“I heard from Sol. Mana reversal doesn’t just happen once. If it’s not fully treated, it could flare up again…”  
“I said I’ve suppressed it. I’ll get proper treatment in the city later.”  
“But…”  
“Instead of worrying about that, focus on yourselves… Ugh, never mind. Just when I thought you were improving, you’re back to square one. Didn’t you learn never to back down against monsters? That’s like shouting to them that you’re scared.”  

The kids looked a bit wronged, and I couldn’t blame them. Facing over forty wolves at once was a first for them. Still, when I cut them off with a tone that brooked no argument, An-hyeon and Yu-jeong lowered their heads.  

I was ready to scold them if they complained about me breaking formation, but they seemed to know they’d messed up.  

Despite my reprimand, their faces remained worried. My grimacing during the Third Eye activation had probably been convincing (it was genuinely exhausting).  

Stretching lightly, I spoke to the kids, who were staring at my lips.  

“Anyway, I’m not turning back. Especially not because of me. So, pull yourselves together. I’ll let it slide this time, but if you act like this again, I won’t go easy on you.”  

“Hyung, but… Sol said mana reversal…”  
“No buts. I know my condition best. I can handle it. Worry about yourselves instead.”  

Only then did the kids slowly start gathering their gear, their faces still glum. The atmosphere, which had been lightening up before the wolves, had plummeted. Seeing their morale drop, I realized the weight of my presence.  

As I turned to move, I felt their hopeful gazes. But I had no intention of retreating. We needed to retrace our steps to where the trail vanished and adjust our path.  

As expected, a path-based barrier had been the culprit. A barrier that could shift you to another world with a single step. The thought of finally grasping a clue to the Alchemist’s Dungeon sent a thrill through me.
