*After*

“Come on. Did you do that on purpose? Telling me to kill them?”

“What’s that? By the way, you really went all out. I didn’t expect you to go *this* far…”

“Disappointed? Hmm, not at all. I was just surprised to see a different side of you all of a sudden. I told you, didn’t I? That was the first time you smiled since we started this expedition.”

“My honest feelings? Haha… Alright, if I’m being honest, I’m a bit excited. No, *very* excited.”

“As expected. You’re not just some kind-hearted pushover putting on a tough act.”

“What are you going to do about it? No sleep for me tonight. You’re having all the fun by yourself.”

“I told you, I’m excited. Do you want to keep making a lady say embarrassing things?”

“If you don’t believe me, why don’t you check my underwear? It’s probably soaked through right now.”

---

In front of me stood two figures: a mage user and an axe-wielding warrior user. Despite my sudden charge, the mage stepped back while the warrior moved to block, suggesting they weren’t complete amateurs.

“───. Shield.”

At that moment, a husky voice chanted, and a translucent barrier formed around the warrior’s body. I had been confident I could close the distance before the spell was cast, but this was unexpected. It seemed the mage had mastered rapid casting, like Jeong Ha-yeon.

“Hryaah!”

If my sword had been enchanted with a Cutting Force spell, their Shield spell might have countered it. The axe warrior, trusting the mage’s shield, ignored defense and raised his axe with all his might. The problem was, my sword wasn’t just any iron blade—it was imbued with the *Authority of the Sword Specialist*.

Before the warrior could swing his axe, I used the *Archer’s Bullet Shadow* technique to kick off the ground once more. Seeing me close the distance rapidly, the axe warrior’s eyes widened, but he responded by putting even more force into his swing.

As I entered close range, I felt the cold edge of the axe above me. At the same moment, my sword’s tip touched the shield spell. The warrior let out a triumphant laugh as he brought his axe down. And then…

*Crack! Shatter!*

The sword I thrust tore through the shield spell and pierced straight into the warrior’s throat. He hadn’t expected the shield to break, and a look of shock flashed in his eyes. That was the last expression he wore in life. My sword had cleanly pierced his throat.

“Gurgle… gurgh…”

Blood frothed from the axe warrior’s mouth, and his axe, which had been swinging down to cleave me, lost its direction and embedded itself in the ground.

“Holy Strike! You bastard, die!”

Before the axe warrior’s body could even collapse, a heavy whooshing sound cut through the air from behind. Glancing back, I saw a mace glowing with white light and the grimacing face of a battle priest.

These guys were definitely vagrants. Aside from Kim Seung-beom, none of the other users showed any distress over their comrade’s death. Instead, they focused on exploiting any opening to bring me down. But agility was my specialty, both in my first cycle and now in my second. Even if they struck first, my agility stat could easily turn the tables. I swiftly raised my sword horizontally and spun my body with force.

*Thud.* The vivid sensation of slicing through soft flesh and hard bone traveled up the blade. The battle priest’s chest was cleaved in half, and his upper body fell to the ground with a look of disbelief. My agility stat was nearly maxed out at 98. Unless they drastically increased their speed, closed the distance, caught me off guard, or attacked from multiple angles, no close-range fighter could hope to seize the initiative from me.

With this, I had taken down five vagrants, including Choi Ju-hyeon. Two remained: the grim-voiced mage and a hooded female archer. In less than thirty seconds of full-on combat, I had already eliminated over half their group. Deciding to deal with the nearby mage first, I turned toward him.

“───. ───. ───.”

The mage had already put more distance between us. He was sweating profusely, his hands forming seals as if preparing a powerful spell. It wasn’t particularly threatening, but I didn’t want to get careless and take a hit to the back of my head. Just as I prepared to use *Archer’s Bullet Shadow* again, the mage’s eyes snapped open.

“───. ───. ───. Flame Spear! Rapid Fire!”

As he completed the incantation, long, blazing spears of fire hurtled toward me—one, two, three, four, five, six. Impressive. He must have mastered magic circuit application as well. That explained why he seemed like their leader. With a short hum of admiration, I raised my sword to block but then lowered it. I wanted to test something.

Seeing me abandon my defense, the mage burst into maniacal laughter.

“Hahaha! That’s right, give up! Just die!”

At the same moment, a message floated into the air:

『*Blessing of the Battlefield* (Rank: EX) has been activated.』

*Boom! Boom!*

The Flame Spears exploded against my body with a deafening roar. Thick, misty smoke billowed around me, and the surrounding grass was scorched black by the flying sparks. The mage’s magic stat was around 90, wasn’t it? Or maybe 89. Either way, I felt a heavy impact rocking my body.

“Kehehe! Finally got him! That was a clean hit. An So-yeon, go check it out! Kehehe!”

Was he *that* happy? His laughter was starting to grate on my nerves. I took a step forward through the thick smoke. The mage’s laughter stopped abruptly as I emerged. Then, more messages appeared in the air:

『Luck stat: 88… Damage mitigation triggered. *Blessing of the Battlefield* EX rank confirmed. Partial defense upgraded. User’s magic stat: 96 confirmed. Lack of anti-magic resistance reduces effect. Fire-based magic detected. *Fire Essence* (Hwa-jeong) in your body reacts. Upgraded to full defense.』

As expected. By now, the mage was probably seeing a message like: “Full defense triggered. No damage dealt.” Sure enough, he stared blankly into the air before stammering.

“W-What the hell? Full defense? That’s insane! No way a zero-year user has anti-magic resistance! Even if you did—n-no, don’t come closer! Aaargh!”

“It’s not anti-magic resistance,” I said calmly, moving quickly toward him.

The mage stumbled back, his face pale as if he’d seen a ghost, but he was too shocked to evade me. I grabbed him by the collar and yanked him up as he gaped at me, dumbfounded.

“Uh, uhh…”

“What was that about violating kids in front of others? Cutting someone to pieces? Oh, An So-yeon, was it? Put down your bow. If you shoot, I’ll tear your arm off like I did to the others. Stay quiet, and I’ll make it quick.”

Without turning, I sensed the female archer flinch and step back. I raised my sword to finish the mage but paused as a better idea struck me. Swinging with both arms, I sliced through his limbs like chopping rotten wood. His arms fell to the ground, spurting blood.

“Hraaagh! Hraaaagh!”

The mage screamed hoarsely, thrashing his head. That was better. His earlier smugness had been unbearable. I cleanly severed his legs as well and let go of his collar. His limbless torso rolled on the ground, surrounded by his severed limbs.

“Aaagh! Aaaaagh! Please, spare me! Aaaaagh!”

“What was that about claiming the whiny priestess? Wondering how she’d cry? Or the foul-mouthed one, curious about what sounds she’d make?”

Sure, he didn’t say those exact words, but he was the one who started this. It was starting to piss me off. Those kids were like treasures to me, raised with care. Feeling a surge of irritation, I stomped on his lips, crushing them. I might’ve put a bit too much emotion into it, as I felt his teeth break under my foot.

“Eeegh! K-kill me! I-I’m sorry! P-please, kill me!”

His childish wails eased some of the frustration in my chest. But then, a sharp, murderous intent pricked at my back. I sighed and spoke quietly.

“I told you not to shoot—”

*Whoosh!*

“Gah!”

The arrow she fired flew past me, piercing the throat of the screaming mage. It wasn’t aimed at me. Feeling a mix of disappointment and disbelief, I slowly turned around. There stood a young girl, her hood down, glaring at me fiercely with a bow aimed in my direction.

She didn’t look like an adult. Her face still had a hint of baby fat, exuding a youthful aura. Then again, not everyone in the Hall Plane was an adult. To act with vagrants at such a young age, she must have a strong will and considerable skill. Curiosity piqued, I spoke in a gentle tone.

“Little one, put down your bow.”

No response. Instead, she radiated hostility, pulling the bowstring taut with even more force. A significant amount of mana gathered around her, and the arrow nocked on her bow began to flicker with yellow light. I let out a wry chuckle and raised my sword. This ability was unmistakably…

“Fine Sight.”

Her youthful voice reached my ears, and the flickering yellow light condensed into a single point at the arrow’s tip. An So-yeon released the string with a voice full of rage.

“Collapse Arrow!”

I quickly summoned my mana, tracking the incoming arrow. With precise movements, I aligned my sword to meet the arrow’s tip exactly. I hadn’t expected to encounter the *Arrow of Destruction*, one of the archer’s unique annihilation abilities, here of all places. And to focus its power with Fine Sight? If I were still the me from my first cycle at this point, that arrow would have shattered my body the moment it grazed me.

*Crunch! Craaack!*

“Ugh!”

*Clang! Clang-clang!*

The arrowhead met my sword’s tip, producing an ear-piercing metallic screech that filled the clearing. The air around us felt like it was being torn apart. I could see why she hadn’t joined the fight earlier. Regular arrows wouldn’t have affected me, but using the Collapse Arrow risked hitting her allies. Or perhaps she was shaken by accidentally killing the priest earlier (though it wasn’t really an accident). Either way, her actions were unusually principled for a vagrant.

But impressive or not, it wasn’t enough to threaten my life. Unless I stood there and let her hit me in the back of the head, that is. The arrow, initially burrowing toward me with destructive force, lost its power as it clashed against my mana-infused sword. With a sound like bursting fireworks, I sliced the arrow in half with ease.

Watching the split arrow fall powerlessly, I saw An So-yeon collapse to her knees, her legs trembling. She seemed unable to believe it, but it looked like she’d put everything into that shot. To satisfy my curiosity, I activated *The Third Eye* to examine her more closely. Her stats were decent, but I wanted a detailed look this time.

Her strength and endurance were a bit low, but her high agility compensated, as expected of an archer. More importantly, her class, special ability, and potential abilities were well-balanced. The rank of her Collapse Arrow was a bit disappointing, but having a unique ability at all was significant.

To think she entered the Hall Plane at 15 and survived this long as a young girl—there was a reason for it. Her stats weren’t extraordinary, but taken as a whole, she was far from an ordinary user.

Whistling, I walked toward her. The bold expression she’d worn earlier was gone, replaced by a terrified one as she scrambled back, pushing against the ground with her feet.
