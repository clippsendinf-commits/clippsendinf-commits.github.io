# Chapter 39: Make an Offer

"The humans living in the Hall Plane can be broadly divided into two categories: the native residents who originally inhabited this place and the Users summoned here by the angels. However, don’t make the mistake of thinking all Users are the same."

"They're not all the same?" Han-byeol asked.

Hyeon-woo nodded. "Some Users strive to return to Earth, while others choose to settle and live in the Hall Plane. In other words, they’ve become residents of this world. Hmm… ‘become residents’ might sound a bit odd. Simply put, they’re people who refuse to return to Earth."

He swallowed hard, as if his throat was dry, and continued. I found myself growing increasingly curious about what he would say next.

"The members of the Golden Lion Clan, and likely all of you, share the desire to return to Earth. We’re actively working to gather clues for our return. But those who’ve chosen to stay in the Hall Plane are different. They wish to remain here forever."

"Then why don’t the Users who want to return just band together and leave those people alone?" Han-byeol countered.

It was a reasonable point, but unfortunately, reality wasn’t so straightforward. Hyeon-woo shook his head. 

"It’s not that simple. The Hall Plane isn’t a game—it’s a real world, with complex relationships and conflicts of interest. Those who’ve settled here go out of their way to obstruct our plans to find a way back to Earth."

Was he referring to the vagrants? For example, there’s a clan called the Murder Brigade. It hasn’t been officially formed yet, but it’s a prime example of the kind of Users Hyeon-woo was talking about. Composed of about ten members, they’re a group of psychopaths who take pleasure in killing. I recalled that their clan would be established shortly after the First Coalition War.

As an aside, their end was quite dramatic. Even after the Northern Continent crossed the Steel Mountains and entered Atlanta—though ‘entered’ might not be the right word—they continued their activities. But they made the mistake of targeting a User from the Red Fang Clan, which controlled a major city. Enraged, Woo Jeong-min and Seon Yu-un hunted them down, wiping them out completely.

"They don’t hesitate to kill fellow Users to achieve their goals. Of course, there are plenty of Users who quietly settle in the Hall Plane without causing trouble, but there are dangerous ones like them as well."

A heavy silence fell over the plaza. Most of the new Users had likely assumed all humans were allies, never considering the possibility that some could be enemies. Of course, someone like Park Dong-geol, with his indifferent expression, might not care—perhaps because he’d already experienced killing, either in the Rite of Passage or for other reasons.

"They operate in the shadows, out of sight. But their power is not to be underestimated. They’re always watching for an opportunity to strike and seize control. You asked about the true purpose of the User Academy? Here’s our answer."

Hyeon-woo fixed his gaze on Han-byeol for a moment before continuing.

"New Users are prime targets for them. They might try to recruit you as allies or use you to satisfy their twisted desires. The User Academy exists to protect and train new Users, shielding them from these threats. It’s a foundation for nurturing talent to stand against them. That’s why both the angels and we strongly recommend joining the Academy early on. It’s a win-win situation for new Users."

The gist of Hyeon-woo’s words was mutual cooperation: veteran Users protect and help new Users adapt to the Hall Plane, and in return, those new Users grow into capable individuals who contribute to the city and continent’s strength.

Han-byeol nodded, seemingly convinced, and sat down. The others around her appeared to agree with Hyeon-woo’s explanation. Everyone except me, that is. His words were true, and he hadn’t said anything incorrect. Joining the Academy early was something I’d planned to do anyway, so I had no complaints. But he hadn’t told the whole truth.

If you traced the root cause of the First Coalition War, you’d find that the Golden Lion Clan, which Hyeon-woo represented, was responsible for sparking it. His criticisms of the shadowy vagrants conveniently glossed over that fact, and it irritated me to hear such hypocrisy from a member of that clan.

He was indirectly disparaging the vagrants, who weren’t aimless wanderers for no reason. The worst of them had bounties on their heads in every city, unwelcome wherever they went—at least in the Northern Continent. 

I wanted to ask him: *Aren’t you all ultimately the same?* I wasn’t defending the vagrants, but I believed the established Users, clinging to their power, were no different from those trying to seize it.

In my first cycle in the Hall Plane, I narrowly escaped death crossing the Steel Mountains to capture Atlanta. But other clans, backed by support from other continents, took advantage of the opportunity and stole Atlanta from us. (Later, we reclaimed it through the infamous Battle of Atlanta, alongside the Ragnarok Siege, considered one of the worst battles in history.)

There’s a saying in the Hall Plane: Users with aligned interests form clans, and clans with common enemies form coalitions. In essence, clans and vagrants are cut from the same cloth—both quick to draw their swords when it suits their needs. Hyeon-woo’s polished words, masking this reality, made my blood boil. Sure, there was no need to tell new Users all this, but as someone who’d experienced it firsthand, his words rang hollow.

As I calmed myself and collected my thoughts, I saw Han-byeol sit back down, seemingly swayed by his speech. It was inevitable—she hadn’t yet experienced the true nature of the Hall Plane, so Hyeon-woo’s words carried weight. Turning back to the stage, I noticed him exhale in relief, as if he hadn’t expected such questions.

"I didn’t expect a few questions to take this long. Some of you look tired, so let’s wrap up for today. I recommend getting a good night’s rest, as training starts tomorrow. Please follow the guides to your lodgings now."

He muttered, “Yu-bin, cancel the voice amplification magic,” and gave instructions to the waiting Users. As they approached us, Hyeon-woo descended from the stage. Just before he reached the stairs, he glanced back at the crowd, his eyes briefly locking onto Han-byeol. In that fleeting moment, I saw a deep interest in his gaze. Glancing at Han-byeol, I noticed she was meeting his eyes. A pang of unease stirred within me.

Large clans often recruit promising new Users or merge with smaller clans, a privilege that’s hard to challenge. Hyeon-woo’s interest in Han-byeol likely stemmed from this. For some reason, I had a strong premonition that she would receive an offer from the Golden Lion Clan.

By the time we reached the Academy’s lodgings, the sky had darkened into night. The rooms were assigned based on our initial groupings, with eight people per room. An-hyeon, quick on his feet, slipped into my group, ensuring we shared a room.

The sleeping arrangements were basic: a single mattress and two blankets. Some might call it shabby, and a few newcomers grumbled, but those who seemed like former soldiers quietly settled in. The User Academy’s facilities were strikingly similar to a military barracks.

The training instructor, with a sly grin, announced that we’d have some freedom tonight. (I immediately requested a cigarette, and he handed me a few without complaint.) Despite the freedom, everyone except me was so exhausted they fell asleep instantly.

An-hyeon slept right beside me, practically glued to my side, which was a bit uncomfortable. As I watched him, I noticed his lips smacking together, as if dreaming of food. *What a carefree guy,* I thought, chuckling softly.

The User Academy in the Northern Continent is notorious across all continents for its grueling training. The thirteen-week program includes increasingly intense exercises that push the boundaries of common sense. I couldn’t help but worry whether the others would endure it.

My chest felt heavy. I’d been sighing deeply for a while now. Reflecting on why, I realized my mind was fixated on the moment Hyeon-woo and Han-byeol exchanged glances.

The more I tried to shake it off and sleep, the more tangled my thoughts became. After tossing and turning, I finally got up, slipped on a pair of worn-out slippers, and opened the tightly shut door. The cool air in the dark hallway was refreshing. I rummaged through my pocket, pulled out a cigarette I’d gotten from the instructor, and lit it.

Sensing no one around, I channeled a faint thread of mana to my fingertip. *Fwoosh.* A small flame sparked, igniting the cigarette before fading. I took a deep drag.

“Haa…”

The men’s and women’s dormitories were in separate buildings. Surprisingly, Han-byeol had been classified as a mana talent, which made sense given her high mana stats. The clan lord I’d served in my first cycle was a combat type, so I felt a twinge of disappointment.

Initially, I’d seen An-hyeon’s group purely as a means to an end. My ultimate goal hadn’t changed, but my perspective had shifted. I acknowledged that Han-byeol was special compared to most Users, but I hadn’t expected to feel this shaken.

*Have I grown attached to her? Or is it something romantic?* I shook my head at the absurd thought. The glowing ashes scattered in the air.

I know myself better than anyone. The idea of forming an emotional bond with someone I’d known for just a week was laughable, given my dry personality. Then it hit me—why had I felt disappointed when she was classified as a mana talent?

From our first meeting and throughout the Rite of Passage, every time I saw Han-byeol, I was reminded of a woman I’d genuinely admired in my first cycle. Perhaps I’d been projecting Han So-yeong onto her. That realization left a bitter taste in my mouth. I felt foolish for agonizing over something so trivial.

I stubbed out the cigarette and turned back. There was much to do and think about ahead. I refused to waste more time on unproductive worries. Sleep still eluded me, but I was determined to rest, even if I had to knock myself out. Quietly, I opened the door and slipped back into the room.
