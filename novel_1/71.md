# Memorize - Chapter 70 (70/1068) 비비앙 라 클라시더스 (Vivian la Clarté)

For a while, I watched Vivian’s squirming with mild interest, but soon grew bored. It wasn’t my concern, and something far more captivating lay in my grasp: the core I had seized from her. As someone willing to brave even hell itself for a chance to boost my stats, I eagerly reached into my cloak, my heart racing with anticipation. I intended to examine the core’s details closely with my Third Eye.

“Ugh… hck! Argh!”

Vivian let out a sharp cry, her body writhing in agony. My heart ached to ignore her suffering, but the moment my hand closed around the hard, spherical core, I forgot her pain entirely.

There was a slim chance it could be a mana stone, though I doubted it. It must have been refined through countless processes during her transformation into a spider, perhaps over decades. With modest expectations, I activated my Third Eye.

**Ancient Alchemist Vivian’s Core**  
*This is the core of Vivian, an ancient alchemist who lived as a spider for over a century. It is a top-grade mana stone that played a central role in her transformation. Over time, it has absorbed countless streams of magical energy within her body, granting it properties akin to an inner core found in spiritual beings. However…*

The description started promisingly, but as I read on, disappointment crept in. After focusing to absorb every detail, I smacked my lips and tucked the mana core back into my cloak.

There was indeed a stat boost mentioned—consuming it could increase one’s Magic stat by 1 to 4 points, depending on the user’s current Magic stat. But there was a catch: it only worked for those with a Magic stat of 70 or below. For anyone above that threshold, like me, it merely smoothed or stabilized mana flow—essentially a glorified healing item. Useless for my purposes.

Still, it wasn’t entirely worthless. I could feed it to Hyeon or Yu-jeong, or sell it for a hefty sum. No rule said I had to consume it myself.

As I mulled over what to do with the loot from this dungeon, I noticed Vivian’s screams had stopped. Realizing this belatedly, I looked up. Could she be dead?

It was obvious that removing the core, the linchpin of her spider form, would cause her internal energy to go haywire. After a century of accumulated power, having the organ that channeled it ripped away was akin to a User losing their ability to wield magic. I raised my head and turned my gaze forward.

“Huh.”

I gasped, startled. The spider was gone. In its place sat a young woman with long, jet-black hair, glaring at me with sharp, clear eyes. I knew instinctively who she was.

“Vivian?”

“Why are you calling me, you jerk?”

“…”

“If you’re going to call me, say something!”

I stared at the human Vivian for a moment before speaking slowly.

“Vivian? Is this your original human form?”

“Can’t you tell? Acting all high and mighty like you know everything.”

Her biting retort made me hum thoughtfully.

“Hmm. I didn’t expect you’d revert to human.”

“Hmph.”

Vivian snorted, and I examined her more closely. Sensing my gaze, she scowled and covered her chest. Only then did I realize she was naked, but her breasts weren’t what interested me. I strode over and placed a hand on her shoulder.

“Pervert.”

She kept hurling insults, but I ignored them. She wasn’t entirely wrong—I had assumed she’d survive having her core removed, but clearly, there was more to it. Seeing her revert to human form, albeit imperfectly, I sank into thought.

*Rip. Crack.*

As I gripped her shoulder, her skin peeled away like a shedding husk. I reflexively let go. Beneath the flaking skin, raw, reddened flesh glistened—an ominous sign. Vivian was dying.

“It hurts…”

Her skin, where I’d touched, split like a cracked road. She groaned, clearly in agony both inside and out. Feeling a twinge of awkwardness—since I wasn’t entirely blameless—I spoke to her.

“This is unexpected. Just pulling out one core turned you human… and you look like you’re about to die. What did you do to end up like this?”

“Hmph. Like you said, it’s not your problem. Do I owe you an explanation?”

“Fair enough.”

When I nodded lightly, Vivian snorted loudly and turned away, her lips sealed, radiating an aura of *I’m done talking to you*. I nodded once or twice, then turned to leave.

“See you, then.”

“W-Wait, hold on! I might… be willing to explain.”

The moment I took a step, her hand shot out, grabbing my cloak. A faint smirk curved my lips as I chuckled.

“You’re kinda cute, you know. Heh.”

“Ho ho, cute, huh? I’ll have you know, back in my human days, I was quite the—er, never mind.”

Vivian, who’d been grinning at the compliment, quickly frowned and pursed her lips. I gave her a look that said *go on, speak*, waiting for her to continue. Meeting my gaze, she blushed and spoke in a shy, hesitant voice.

“So… you really want to know?”

“Nope.”

“Phew, okay then—huh? Hey! Don’t go!”

When I turned away again after my blunt “Nope,” she shouted in frustration. I stopped, shrugging with an innocent expression.

“What? I’m ready to leave.”

“What about me?!”

She thumped her chest in exasperation, causing it to jiggle. Hmm, a full B-cup, I’d say. Noticing my glance, she bit her lip and covered herself again.

“You told me to mind my own business.”

“Mind it! You *can* mind it!”

“No thanks.”

My flat rejection made her face crumple as she crawled toward me, clutching my pant leg. Talk about dramatic.

“Please, care about me! Please!” she begged, voice trembling.

“Look, I spared your life. Isn’t that enough?”

“What?! You don’t even know what you’ve done! You ripped out my core without a clue, and now my body’s falling apart! Look at my skin splitting! You can just skip off, but I’m done for! Thanks to you, I’ve lost all the power I had as a spider *and* my accumulated life force! My insides are a mess, my outsides are worse—what are you going to do about it?!”

Feigning shock, I widened my eyes and gasped, “What?! So because of me, you’re…”

“Yes, you idiot! If this keeps up, I’ll be a pile of ash in five days!”

“Alright, Vivian. Thanks for everything you’ve given me and helped with. Goodbye.”

“That’s not what I meant! Please…!” she wailed.

As she burst into tears again, I responded in a cold tone.

“You gave it to me, didn’t you? Let’s not make this messy. Clean break, yeah?”

At my harsh words, Vivian mumbled incoherently through her sobs. Feeling a slight pang of pity, I softened my tone.

“There *might* be a way to fix this…”

“What?! What is it?”

She must have overheard my muttering (which I’d intended her to hear). Her ears perked up, and she leaned in eagerly, her eyes gleaming with a fierce will to live. I was curious why she was so desperate, but I held off asking for now. First, I needed to check her information. Activating my Third Eye, I focused on her.

**Resident Information (Native Status)**

2. **Class**: Chimera Alchemist (Rare: Chimera Alchemist Master)  
3. **Nation**: Espinion (a now-destroyed city-state)  
4. **Clan**: None  
5. **True Name · Nationality**: Ancient Alchemist · Obsidian Hunting Spider · Hall Plane  
6. **Sex**: Female (24 · 128[?])  
7. **Height · Weight**: 165.5 cm · 48.8 kg

**[Strength 48] [Endurance 25(-25)] [Agility 56] [Vitality 20(-25)] [Magic 42(-50)] [Luck 49(-25)]**  
*Due to the forced removal of the core that served as the linchpin of her physical transformation, her internal systems are in chaos, and this process is ongoing. She cannot use her abilities as a Chimera Alchemist.*  
*She has reverted to human form, but the process was not orderly and involved an unknown coercive force, causing significant internal trauma. Some stats are continuously declining.*  
*She is critically injured and requires urgent treatment. Without intervention, she may die soon. Even a Greater Healing spell cannot address her internal injuries. While it may save her life, permanent aftereffects are highly likely.*  
*Using one or more Elixirs can fully heal her internal and external injuries.*

After carefully reading the information, I looked up to find Vivian swallowing hard, staring at me. I didn’t respond immediately. Her lips twitched with impatience, and I subtly turned my head to avoid her gaze.

“On second thought, it might not work. I shouldn’t have said anything. Let’s drop it.”

“Hey, that’s not fair! If you bring it up, at least finish the thought!”

“…No.”

The solution to saving Vivian was simple: use one of the two Elixirs stashed in the User-exclusive storage back in the city. But I hadn’t saved those Elixirs for nothing—they were already earmarked for others. Sure, healing her might make her useful, but honestly, it felt like a waste.

As I turned to leave, Vivian grabbed me again, pleading desperately. I kicked her off and walked toward the passage, her anguished sobs echoing behind me.

“I want to live… I *want* to live! How can you be so cruel?! After everything you’ve done to me… I… I…”

“Twisting Users’ necks, slicing waists, letting monsters violate them—you don’t think about *those* things, do you?”

“I’m the master of this place! I have the right to defend myself and punish intruders. I could even hold you accountable for slaughtering my minions!”

Her trembling lips and defiant retorts made me sigh. She wasn’t entirely wrong, but humans are selfish creatures. Still, I didn’t have time for a pointless argument. Something about leaving her like this felt off, a nagging unease in the back of my mind. I turned back.

This wasn’t a game anymore—I was seriously considering recruiting Vivian. As my cold gaze fell on her, she flinched and lowered her head.

“S-Sorry. I went too far. My bad.”

She kept apologizing, though she wasn’t exactly in a position to be angry. Setting aside the idea of her as an enemy and considering her as a potential ally, a wave of unexpected pity washed over me.

After an awkward silence, I spoke quietly.
