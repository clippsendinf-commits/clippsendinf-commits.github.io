# Memorize - Chapter 105: Settings Change Announcement

First, I would like to apologize for not providing a consecutive update.  
I am borrowing Chapter 105 to announce a few changes to the settings of *Memorize*.  
Here are the details of the changes:

**<Settings Changes>**  
1. **Mind’s Eye (Refined)**  
Rather than seeing the external appearance as it is, this is the eye of the heart that can perceive the inner essence of a target. It refers to the ability to introspect oneself, observe or sense all things, or phenomena with similar effects. A mind honed to its utmost limit can maintain composure even under mental corruption magic of S-rank or below.

2. **Blessing of the Battlefield (Description)**  
Athena, the goddess of war who protects peace. This ability activates only on the battlefield, granting the blessing of the goddess to a single soldier within that battlefield. The user who receives this blessing gains a wide field of vision that encompasses the entire battlefield and can instantly identify the position of allies in crisis. Additionally, because the blessing is imbued with divine power, it unconditionally reduces damage from magical effects, including when activated outside the battlefield. (This reduction is calculated based on the ability’s rank and the user’s Luck stat.)  
User Kim Su-hyeon’s Luck stat is at a decent level, but due to the blessing’s ability reaching its peak, it provides partial defense against magical effects one rank higher than the applied value and reduced defense against magical effects two ranks higher.

3. **Great Magic Resistance → Magic Resistance**  
4. **High-Speed Incantation → Swift Chant**  
5. **Orthodox (Alchemy) Sorcery → Orthodox (Alchemy) Magic**

Items 3 and 4 have not yet been detailed, but as their names suggest, their basic characteristics remain the same. I plan to add specific restrictions and settings unique to *Memorize* in future detailed explanations.  
Item 5 changes the term “sorcery” to “magic.”

**Current Revision Details**  
The following chapters have been revised:  
- Chapter 7: Kim Su-hyeon’s stat section  
- Chapter 32: Mind’s Eye activation message description  
- Chapter 46: Mind’s Eye potential ability awakening section  
- Chapter 73: Vivian’s stat section  
- Chapter 79: Sorcery to magic terminology change  
- Chapter 82: Shin Sang-yong’s stat section  
- Chapter 83: Main text, Jeong Ha-yeon’s stat section  
- Chapter 84: Main text  
- Chapter 87: Main text  

After reviewing all chapters from 1 to 104, a total of nine chapters have been revised. If you happen to find any remaining instances of the old terminology, I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know.  

Sincerely,  
Ro Yu-jin
