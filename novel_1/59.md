# Chapter 58: Dungeon of Alchemist (2)

“Ow… that hurts. That’s too much!”  
Sol rubbed her backside, whining about the pain. Hyeon gave an awkward smile and extended a hand, but Sol turned her head sharply, showing her displeasure. Hyeon’s face fell, as if struck. I approached with a stern expression and helped her up. Sol pouted but still leaned into me obediently.  
“Why… why only me?”  
“Hmph.”  
Hyeon tried to wedge himself between me and Sol, venting his frustration, but all he got was a cold response. Seeing him deflate again, I spoke in a firm tone.  
“Sol.”  
“What~?”  
Perhaps sensing some lingering resentment toward me, Sol replied not with her usual innocent “Yes?” but with a slightly defiant tone. However, when she saw my hardened expression, she immediately lowered her eyes and bowed her head. Then, a sudden yelp escaped her lips.  
“Eek?!”  
…All that effort to help her up, and now it’s gone to waste. They say if luck’s against you, you’ll break your nose even falling backward—Sol was exactly that case.  
“Calm down, calm down. There, there. Good girl.”  
One thing puzzled me: why, of all people, did she so skillfully dodge Hyeon in front of her and end up in my arms? Still, she was genuinely shaken, trembling with tears welling in her eyes, so I gently comforted her and crouched down.  
Hyeon and Yujeong followed suit, crouching as well, but they recoiled with startled expressions. The reason was clear: Sol had been lying on top of a user’s corpse—a grotesquely twisted, gruesome body.  
“Urgh…!”  
Yujeong couldn’t hold it in and retched. Even I frowned slightly at the sight. This kind of brutality was something only the worst of the Murder Brigade would do…  
Beside the body lay a broken bow, suggesting the user was likely an archer (Affiliation: Ranger). The neck and face, twisted in agony as if the bones had been wrenched out, caught my eye. To have made it through the middle and rear sections of the Black Forest and into this dungeon, they must have been a skilled caravan. Yet, seeing this, I could guess why they were wiped out.  
“Idiots… No guide, and they still crawled into a dungeon? Completely insane. Or maybe greed blinded them.”  
It wasn’t my place to judge, but I muttered to myself and bit my lip. I knew the atmosphere would shift drastically between the surface and underground, but this was like a fastball right from the start. While soothing Sol, who was trembling and clenching her teeth, I calmly surveyed our surroundings.  
It was, quite literally, a pitch-black, straight corridor. The only directions were forward or back. From here on, we didn’t need to follow the caravan’s trail. It was unfortunate they were found dead after two years and some months, but that had nothing to do with me. Activating my Third Eye, I planned to scour every detail thoroughly. And while we were at it, I’d take down the alchemist, the dungeon master, who likely had some decent gear to drop.  
Calculating internally, I turned to the others with a spark of excitement, only to frown immediately. The shock of seeing the corpse had hit them hard; their faces were filled with unease, and they were visibly rattled. Yujeong was even subtly radiating a desire to return to the city. I opened my mouth in a sharp tone, addressing them.  
“What’s with you all? This your first time seeing a user’s corpse? Don’t you know this is common in the Hall Plane? You’ve killed vagrants before, so why the fuss over one body?”  
At my scolding, their throats bobbed as they swallowed hard. But they still exchanged hesitant glances, a trace of reluctance lingering in their hearts. I pressed on with an even stronger tone.  
“What’s wrong with you? You were all thrilled when we found a dungeon on our first expedition, and now you’re already tucking tail? Do you even realize how big the rewards will be if we succeed this time?”  
“…”  
It might sound crass, but this was reality—the truth. Their behavior showed they still hadn’t reached the mental standard I expected. In the Hall Plane, you can’t view people as <modern humans>. They must be seen as <users>.  
“Don’t you get what it means to find a dungeon on your first expedition? If we tough it out this time, things will get so much easier later. The treasure’s right in front of us—do you want to kick it away? Are you satisfied with just finding it and heading back to the city?”  
“N-No! Absolutely not. No way, hyung. Not at all.”  
Hyeon was the first to snap out of it, vehemently shaking his head and slapping his cheeks, as if rearming himself mentally. My frustration eased slightly, but I couldn’t help feeling they were still pathetic. Back when I followed Yuhyeon-hyung’s group or worked under Han Soyeong, keeping up was a real challenge. Sure, it’s not a fair comparison, but the impatience gnawed at me.  
“You’re all the same. Forget expeditions—on explorations like this, it’s not uncommon for entire caravans to get wiped out, let alone lose a few members. Of course, I want to keep you all alive. I have no intention of letting us get annihilated. But I can’t do it alone. I need your help.”  
“…Yeah. Sorry. I get it. Sorry, oppa.”  
After my persistent prodding, Yujeong finally seemed to pull herself together, standing with a determined expression. Her clenched jaw and trembling legs showed she hadn’t fully shaken off the horror of the corpse, but it was a step up from vomiting.  
“…Haa. Anyway… Sol, let’s head to the center now. There, there. Good girl. Let’s move. Everyone, form up.”  
At my words, they nodded and took their positions. I let out a sigh and turned around. From behind, I heard Yujeong mutter under her breath, “Always favoring Sol,” but I didn’t respond.  
Objectively and subjectively, Yujeong wasn’t wrong.  

*  

We advanced slowly in a triangular formation. It differed slightly from the one we used in the forest—Hyeon and Yujeong, guarding the flanks, were now angled 45 degrees closer to me. The dungeon was dark, but Sol’s Light spell provided enough visibility.  
Walking through the pitch-black underground, we stayed vigilant. So far, no traps or monsters had triggered my detection. The occasional finds were just piles of ash from defeated monsters or already-triggered traps, likely cleared by the caravan that came before us. Thanks to them, our path was easier, and I felt a twinge of gratitude.  
Part of me wondered if the future might shift and they’d claim all the rewards, but it didn’t matter. If it came to that, I could just kill them all and take everything back. With those grim thoughts—ones that would make the earlier users gasp—I kept moving forward.  
Sol’s Light spell was still unstable, the orb wobbling and drifting erratically. It seemed to irritate Yujeong, who swatted at it with an annoyed gesture when it lingered near her. The orb promptly floated away.  
I didn’t understand why the two were at odds, but I decided to ask later and expanded my detection further.  
“Hm.”  
After some time, I stopped abruptly and let out a low hum. The others tensed immediately, raising their weapons and extending their own detection. I felt a slight satisfaction—they were finally starting to act like a unit. Sol was even muttering a spell despite no enemy appearing. Raising one hand to ease their alertness, I spoke calmly.  
“There’s some presence ahead. It’s… odd. We’ll need to get closer to check.”  
Seeing them reflexively raise their hands again at my signal made me smile bitterly. I wished they’d be more consistent, but their reactions swung too much with the situation, making them hard to predict even for me. Brushing off the fleeting thought, I sharpened my vision and hearing.  
Though still some distance away, the presence wasn’t a monster but a user. Yet, it felt too small to be a user, and faint groans reached my ears. I gestured for the others to follow and rushed forward.  
“Ugh…”  
As the distance closed, the groans grew clearer. Could the caravan have been wiped out this quickly? No, they shouldn’t have fallen so easily. Various thoughts swirled, but confirming their status was the priority. If they were alive, we might extract some information.  
“Haa… ugh…”  
There it was—a user collapsed on the ground came into view. I sprinted over and dropped to my knees. The others, following blindly, gasped when they saw the figure. First, we’d seen an archer. Now, the user before us wore priestly robes, their body gruesomely torn in half at the waist, sprawled across the floor.  
“…It’s a miracle they’re alive.”  
A faint white glow emanated from the upper body, suggesting they’d desperately cast a healing spell. After checking their condition, I reflexively activated my Third Eye.

Not worth saving. Not for a Year 4 user. After reviewing his stats and details, I abandoned the idea of saving him. Sensing our presence, the male user struggled to open his eyes and looked at us.  
For a priest with these stats to survive such wounds was impressive—likely due to a self-cast healing spell or a special or potential ability. Still, with injuries this severe, death was inevitable.  
“U-User… how…”  
“What happened? When did you enter this dungeon? Where are your companions?”  
“Tch… thank… *cough*!”  
“Oppa, let’s try to save him first…”  
No point. Don’t waste effort—better to extract what information we can. I barely stopped myself from saying it aloud. I still needed to watch my words. Sol began chanting a healing spell, and Yujeong handed me a stamina potion. Though it pained me to waste mana and a potion, I reluctantly opened it.  
“Idiots. Why’d you enter a dungeon without a guide? Anyway, open your mouth.”  
Whispering softly, I propped up the man’s face and poured the potion into his mouth. At first, he seemed to swallow a little, but then he coughed up a gush of blood. Sol flinched, disrupting her spell and rendering it useless. When I tried to force more potion, the priest weakly shook his head, refusing. He seemed to know he couldn’t be saved and had calmly accepted death.  
Yet, I sensed something off. Despite accepting death, he’d been clinging to life, trying to hold on just a bit longer. But upon seeing us, he gave up. That meant he had something to tell us.  
Finally, the male user spat out a mouthful of blood and struggled to speak.
