# Memorize - Chapter 124: A Small Rebellion

Go Yeon-ju was smiling at me, but she seemed to already know that Ha-yeon was chanting a spell. The moment her shadow, reflected on the floor, began to writhe, I swiftly drew the sword from my waist. With the clear sound of the blade being unsheathed, Go Yeon-ju’s shadow spun once and surged toward Ha-yeon.

Ha-yeon looked startled by the sudden attack. Yet, even in that moment, I could see the necklace around her neck emitting a white light.

“───. Target designated: Silhouette. Overlap.”

No matter what attack came, she didn’t give up and cast a spell to counter it. Even when surprised, she did what needed to be done. Mages are required to maintain cold rationality in any situation, and Ha-yeon was demonstrating the epitome of a mage’s discipline.

The magic bursting from her necklace, combined with the Anti-Magic spell cast through rapid incantation, caused the white light to spill into the air, then melt like water into the shadow. Though Ha-yeon’s spell only managed to make the shadow hesitate, the two seconds she bought were enough for my sword to reach Go Yeon-ju’s throat.

“…Hmph.”

A chilling silence fell. Go Yeon-ju sat there, propping her chin, but I didn’t miss the flicker of surprise in her eyes. Of course, she had probably meant it as a playful jab, but a second-year User had just been outmaneuvered by someone ranked among the <Ten Strong>. Ha-yeon’s decision to use the now-defunct Memorize spell was highly effective, even if it was a tactic that would likely only work this once.

“Enough with the games.”

I pressed the sword closer to Go Yeon-ju, who was rolling her eyes playfully. The last time she had embraced me, she had chosen to back off. And this time was no different. With a 1:3 standoff and the situation already turning against her—plus a sword radiating killing intent right below her chin—there was no reason for Go Yeon-ju to push further.

As expected, she calmly withdrew her shadow and raised both hands. Ha-yeon let out a sigh of relief as the shadow slithered back. I marveled at Ha-yeon once more and slightly withdrew my sword. At the same time, I saw Go Yeon-ju’s throat bob as she swallowed.

When I fully lowered my sword, Go Yeon-ju touched her neck.

“Phew. Isn’t it unfair for a man to interfere in a fight between women?”

“Is that all you have to say?”

“…Sorry. I went a bit too far with the joke.”

Go Yeon-ju bowed her head. I knew she meant it as a prank, and I hadn’t intended to demand an apology. So, I decided to let it go at that. It might seem insincere at a glance, but the fact that a <Ten Strong> User apologized so readily was significant. However, Ha-yeon stared at her with disbelief, then furrowed her brow as if something felt off.

“The shadow… Could it be…?”

As Ha-yeon muttered, Go Yeon-ju gave a sly smile and spoke up.

“May I introduce myself?”

“By all means.”

With my permission, she straightened her posture and leaned politely toward Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong. But this time, it wasn’t an apology—she was deliberately exuding her presence, almost showing off.

“Hello. I’m Go Yeon-ju, known as the Shadow Queen, a fifth-year User. I’m currently running an inn in Mul due to certain circumstances. I sincerely apologize for the earlier rudeness.”

“Gasp!”

“…”

As expected, Shin Sang-yong practically jumped out of his seat in shock. Ha-yeon’s eyes widened too, but she didn’t make a fool of herself like Shin Sang-yong. Their gazes clashed in the air, and I saw the corner of Go Yeon-ju’s mouth curl upward.

“I said I’m sorry. It was meant as a greeting.”

“…So, <Ten Strong> Users greet others by attacking them, do they?”

Go Yeon-ju twisted her lips at Ha-yeon’s cold retort and replied, “Oh my. I didn’t intend to kill you. Who was it that started chanting a spell first, I wonder?”

“Oh my. I don’t recall planning to chant a spell either.”

Seeing Ha-yeon snap back, Go Yeon-ju raised an eyebrow as if to say, “What’s this?” Ha-yeon held her head high, while Go Yeon-ju, still slightly bent at the waist, tilted her head upward. They locked eyes. Silence lingered for a moment, but Go Yeon-ju was the first to speak.

“Does one apology make me look weak to you? And could you stop glaring at me like that? It’s making me want to kill you.”

“I don’t know why you’re acting so proud when you’re the one at fault. I didn’t sense any sincerity in your apology either.”

At Ha-yeon’s words, Go Yeon-ju let out a short laugh, then straightened her back. She drew a dagger from her waist and began twirling it between her fingers.

“Sincerity? I was a bit curious because Su-hyun took an interest in you, but you’re still so green. What’s there to nitpick in the Hall Plane?”

Ha-yeon, perhaps at a loss for words, merely snorted. Indeed, the Hall Plane was a world primarily governed by strength and ability. As a <Ten Strong> User, Go Yeon-ju held a position so high that ordinary Users could hardly dream of reaching her. Ha-yeon’s attitude was certainly not normal, but there was one reason that could justify it. And Go Yeon-ju likely had a rough idea of what that was.

“The Shadow Queen sure got taken down a peg. Getting schooled by a mere kid. You know why your head’s still attached, don’t you?”

“Of course. I’m acting this way because I’ve got someone backing me.”

“You sure talk big for someone relying on borrowed power! I’ll let it slide this time for User Kim Su-hyun’s sake, but next time, you’re done for. Ho ho.”

“Are you denying the importance of Caravans and Clans? If you acknowledge individual strength, you should also acknowledge the power of connections. I’m not sure we’ll meet again, though. Heh.”

“Enough, both of you.”

The situation was escalating to the point where it felt like blades might actually be drawn, so I stepped in to cut it off. Both women turned to me with expressions of dissatisfaction. I let out a loud sigh for them to hear.

Objectively, Go Yeon-ju was the most powerful User in this room. From a modern perspective, Go Yeon-ju was more at fault, but in the Hall Plane’s terms, both shared equal blame. However, considering I’m a zero-year User, Ha-yeon’s attitude was excessive by objective standards.

Through my few encounters with Go Yeon-ju, I had made it clear that I held the upper hand, and she had partially accepted that. Thus, Go Yeon-ju’s fault lay in forcing her way into the situation and playing a rather harsh prank, despite my presence—enough to make onlookers frown. Yes, Ha-yeon had started chanting a spell first, but Go Yeon-ju was the one who provoked us with her background check.

Ha-yeon, for her part, had reacted in a way that was unlike her usual self. Despite being far below Go Yeon-ju’s level, she didn’t back down—she essentially “talked back.” While expressing one’s will is fine, her attitude would have been suicidal if Go Yeon-ju hadn’t known my strength or if I were weaker than her.

Of course, in the brief two-second clash, Ha-yeon and I had coordinated to gain the upper hand, and she likely trusted my abilities. But that alone didn’t fully explain her behavior. I could only speculate that some emotion, unique to women, had been triggered.

If I had to pinpoint one thing, it was probably when Go Yeon-ju mentioned Ha-yeon’s background, touching a nerve. I had noticed Ha-yeon’s eyes sharpen when Go Yeon-ju referred to her as the “abandoned mage User.”

Compared to her usual rational demeanor, this behavior was a bit out of character. But I decided to ask her about it later—I didn’t believe Ha-yeon would act this way without reason.

After organizing my thoughts, I turned to Go Yeon-ju and spoke.

“Go Yeon-ju. User Jeong Ha-yeon is currently a member of my Caravan. The background check was unpleasant enough, but deliberately letting it slip doesn’t feel like it was done with good intentions. I’d appreciate it if you refrained from such excessive actions in the future.”

At my words, Ha-yeon’s face brightened, while Go Yeon-ju’s darkened. But I continued immediately.

“And… I’ll speak with User Jeong Ha-yeon about this later.”

This time, Ha-yeon’s face fell, and Go Yeon-ju smirked. I had defended Ha-yeon, preserved Go Yeon-ju’s dignity, and clarified my own stance. In other words, I was telling them to stop making trouble and settle things here. Both Ha-yeon and Go Yeon-ju seemed to find the situation amusing, as they gave slight nods.

Shin Sang-yong, who had been fidgeting anxiously, finally seemed to calm down as the situation resolved. He pushed up his glasses and began closely observing Go Yeon-ju. Sitting at the same table as a <Ten Strong> User was a rare opportunity.

Perhaps sensing his gaze, Go Yeon-ju spoke in a sultry voice.

“Stop staring. Looking at me so intensely is getting me… excited.”

“W-Wah! S-S-Sorry! I-I didn’t mean…”

Shin Sang-yong, startled by her words, ducked his head. Yet, he kept stealing glances at her, and it was obvious what he was thinking. His jaw was practically on the floor just because a <Ten Strong> User had spoken to him directly. Go Yeon-ju, perhaps amused by his reaction, gave a sly smile and continued.

“What?”

“W-Well, I mean…”

“I mean?”

As she pressed him, Shin Sang-yong’s face turned beet red, and he floundered. Finally, he spoke in a voice barely louder than a mosquito’s buzz.

“It’s just… you’re so different from the image I had of the Shadow Queen…”

“Oh? What kind of image are you talking about?”

“Ahem…”

Shin Sang-yong cleared his throat, trying to change the subject. Go Yeon-ju, clearly enjoying the moment, let out a peal of laughter. Then, she smoothly untied her neatly bound hair.

“Go Yeon-ju?”

Sensing she was about to do something strange, I spoke up, but she winked at me and gripped the top of her clothing tightly.

“Something like… this vibe?”

*Riiip!*

“Gasp.”

“Eek.”

As she finished speaking, she yanked her clothes hard. The force was so strong that her modest attire tore apart, top and bottom, in one go. The fabric turned to rags and fell to the floor. The boldness of the act caught Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong off guard, and they let out soft cries.

Go Yeon-ju then casually crossed her legs, nearly bare.

To be precise, she wasn’t completely naked. The contrast between what she had been wearing and her current outfit was jarring, but she was technically clothed. The problem was how revealing it was. A drastically cropped tank top exposed her shoulders and more than half her chest, looking like it might burst if touched. Her lower half was clad in something that bared her thighs completely—not thin, but slightly plump in an enticing way. Any man seeing those thighs would instinctively want to grab them.

With her long, ash-gray hair cascading down, she exuded a decadent aura. She held the dagger she had been twirling upright and placed it precisely between her tightly pressed cleavage. Slowly, she pressed a finger downward. The dagger, radiating a sharp edge that seemed like it could cut with the slightest misstep, slid between her chest. The scene was both provocative and dangerous, and Shin Sang-yong swallowed hard.

Watching their reactions calmly, Go Yeon-ju spoke in a low voice.

“Now, are you satisfied?”

Her sultry voice sent a languid ripple through the room. Gone was the polite tone. This was her declaration that she was now facing us not as an innkeeper but as the full-fledged Shadow Queen. The dangerously seductive aura emanating from her made Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong hold their breath. I worried Ha-yeon might step in again, but fortunately, she knew when to back off. And now was the time to back off.

Go Yeon-ju let out a sweet breath, then slowly turned her head toward me. Licking her lips lightly, she slid closer to my side.

“Let me pour you a drink.”

“Hold on…”

“Oh, come on. The night is long. Just have one.”

Go Yeon-ju breathed softly into my ear. Her unstable aura made it hard to see this as mere gratitude for saving her face earlier.

What mattered was that her attitude toward Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong differed from how she treated me. It was her subtle signal to step forward. Without waiting for my response, she gave a seductive smile, picked up a bottle, and forced a glass into my hand. Then, with both hands, she began pouring politely.

*Glug glug.*

Go Yeon-ju had somehow pressed herself close to my side. Her lips, now inches away, exuded a sweet fragrance, mingled with the soft scent of a woman. As she moved, her chest lightly brushed against my arm. Each subtle movement sent the sensation of her soft skin and the cold edge of her dagger through my hand.

Reflexively, I glanced at Ha-yeon. She was giving me a worried look, signaling me to be careful. It wasn’t petty jealousy—she was genuinely concerned for me. Her expression eased my mind a little. Bolstered by her support, I steeled myself.

The early clash had been a battle of wills between Ha-yeon and Go Yeon-ju, but with Go Yeon-ju revealing her true self, Ha-yeon had stepped back. Now, it was my turn to take the stage.
