# Memorize - Chapter 13 (13/1068)

# Split in Half

At Park Dong-geol’s proposal, An-hyeon seemed deeply conflicted. If it had been anyone else suggesting to form a team, he likely wouldn’t have hesitated this much. Instinctively, An-hyeon didn’t trust Park Dong-geol. No matter how polished his words were, An-hyeon sensed an indescribable, dark, and unsettling vibe.

Regardless, Park Dong-geol held the upper hand in terms of justification. No matter how he spun it, he had already secured two of the three weaker members—An-sol and Lee Sin-u—into his fold.

An-hyeon’s unease had grown to its peak. He couldn’t abandon his younger sister, but her actions had already led to consequences, as seen in the clearing incident. To make matters worse, An-hyeon had no real choice left. Park Dong-geol’s calculated ambiguity left him in a dilemma, unable to move forward or back.

If the situation tipped even slightly more in Park Dong-geol’s favor, it was highly likely that An-hyeon, An-sol, and Lee Yu-jeong would be left behind. Unbeknownst to Park Dong-geol, he was digging his own grave. My perspective differed vastly from that of the others here. I judged people based on their dispositions and stats, determining who could survive. But Park Dong-geol lacked that ability and didn’t even seem to want it.

From the start, Park Dong-geol and I had different criteria for the team we wanted. I sought companions who could be helpful after entering the Hall Plane, while Park Dong-geol wanted a team he could manipulate to his liking.

In a way, this situation was a boon for me.

For now, the balance of power hinged on my choice and Kim Han-byeol’s. Since I wasn’t present, all eyes naturally turned to Kim Han-byeol. She had been quietly thinking, and after briefly scanning her surroundings, she stood up. But the slight bite of her lip suggested she hadn’t yet made a decision.

“We should probably bring the person keeping watch as well,” she said after a long pause.

Her words weren’t a choice, and the group, who had been tensely awaiting her decision, let out a collective sigh of relief.

Acting as if he were someone important, Park Dong-geol chimed in, “Ah, right,” and then spoke in a tone that implied he was granting permission.

“Sure… go get him. Tell him the gist of it on the way and have him make a choice. We don’t have much time, so you’d better make up your mind too. Oh, hold on.”

As Kim Han-byeol turned to leave, Park Dong-geol’s words stopped her. With the most ingratiating smile he could muster, he continued, “You and that guy could be useful. So, talk it over on the way. I won’t let you down. After all…”

Glancing briefly at An-hyeon, he deliberately trailed off.

“Anyway, you two are welcome. Choose wisely.”

Park Dong-geol’s performance was reaching its peak, a dragon soaring to its zenith. Lee Sin-u, already won over, gave Kim Han-byeol a small gesture of encouragement. For all intents and purposes, Park Dong-geol had already won this round. Whether I liked it or not, he had achieved his goal.

The start may have been messy, but age clearly hadn’t dulled his cunning. Lee Sin-u and Lee Bo-rim were unaware—or perhaps willfully ignorant—that they could be used as bait or pawns. They had either failed to see it or succumbed to the allure of survival.

Seeing Kim Han-byeol approach, I slowly closed my eyes. My head ached, yet there was a strange clarity. I could have disrupted Park Dong-geol’s plans if I wanted, but that would defeat the purpose of stepping away. More importantly, though unintentional, this situation could be a win-win for both him and me.

Park Dong-geol had eliminated An-hyeon and Lee Yu-jeong, who were obstacles to his control, and I could secure three of the four people I had in mind. His irritating presence had been grating on me, but if he removed himself, why would I interfere? It was frustrating that talented individuals had fallen for his silver tongue, but that was their problem, not mine. If I could just bring the last person into the fold, things might resolve faster than I expected.

*Rustle, rustle.*

As I kept my eyes closed, I heard the sound of grass being brushed aside from behind. I didn’t need to turn to know who it was. I quickly stood, equipping the crossbow on my left arm. Seeing Kim Han-byeol reminded me of *her* for some reason, stirring an odd, inexplicable feeling. Pretending to scan the surroundings with my crossbow raised, I soon heard her soft voice calling out.

“Hey…”

“Yes?” I turned, feigning surprise.

Kim Han-byeol was looking at me with calm eyes. I deliberately rubbed my left arm, making a pained expression, and said, “I heard some cries a couple of times, but there’s nothing around yet.”

“You’ve worked hard. We’ve mostly sorted things out, so you should come back now.”

“Then let’s go.”

I was about to turn with a casual expression when, as expected, Kim Han-byeol stopped me.

“Wait a moment.”

Turning back, I saw her hesitate before speaking. “Things… took a strange turn.”

“Strange turn?” I asked.

“Yes. Here’s what happened…”

Nodding at my question, Kim Han-byeol began recounting the events. I wanted to gauge her thoughts, but she spoke with remarkable objectivity, summarizing only the key points. Normally, in such situations, people’s accounts lean one way or another, but I was genuinely impressed by her impartiality.

“So that’s how it turned out,” she concluded. Curious about my stance, she asked, “What are you going to do?”

I had already made up my mind but tilted my head, feigning indecision. “I didn’t expect things to go this way. I’m still not sure.”

“Me neither,” she replied.

“What do you think of that guy’s words?” I asked.

Kim Han-byeol met my eyes for a moment before answering in a softer voice than usual. “He’s not wrong, exactly. But…”

“Something doesn’t sit right with you?”

“…Yes. Whenever I see him, I get an uneasy feeling. But oddly, I couldn’t find any fault in what he said at the time.”

Lee Sin-u and Lee Bo-rim had already been swayed. Seeing them must have made her waver.

And then I understood why she had come to fetch me herself. I wanted to keep talking, but time was ticking, so I started walking, briefly falling silent. Having confirmed a sliver of her thoughts, all I needed was to add a bit of seasoning as we went.

Though we didn’t speak, I could feel Kim Han-byeol following me. After a calculated pause, I spoke up. “I don’t like what that guy said.”

“…”

“He cleverly mixed the strengths and flaws of his argument. That’s why it doesn’t seem wrong. He dressed up the flaws with advantages to make his words sound compelling.”

Though she didn’t respond, I sensed an unspoken urge for me to elaborate. Park Dong-geol had been cunning, but I couldn’t afford to lose Kim Han-byeol. So, I decided to address her doubts one by one.

“Not lying and being honest requires one condition: keeping your word. Does that guy seem like someone who keeps his promises?”

“No,” Kim Han-byeol answered immediately.

“From the moment we met, his attitude has been off, and his actions are disrupting team harmony. Rather than trusting his vague promises and joining his team, I think it’s better to stay with the people already here. So, I’m sticking with them.”

Glancing back, I saw Kim Han-byeol deep in thought, mulling over my words. Less than a minute later, as we approached the group in the distance, I heard her whisper behind me, “I’m worried about the two who went with him.”

That was as good as confirmation that she had made her choice. I was glad I’d taken a subtle approach instead of being blunt. If I had said something like, “Park Dong-geol, that bastard, is just trying to use Lee Bo-rim and Lee Sin-u. Don’t go with him, or you’ll be used too,” she might have distrusted me as well. She seemed sharp enough to grasp the gist of my words with just a nudge.

As we drew closer, the two divided groups came clearly into view. Nothing had changed since I last saw them.

On one side were An-hyeon, An-sol, and Lee Yu-jeong. On the other were Park Dong-geol, Lee Sin-u, and Lee Bo-rim.

The moment we crested the hill, six pairs of eyes turned toward Kim Han-byeol and me.

*

“They’re here. Good work keeping watch,” Park Dong-geol said, acting as if he were in charge.

An irritating feeling surged within me, but I suppressed it. An-hyeon’s steady gaze, An-sol’s anxious eyes, Lee Yu-jeong’s tense stare, Lee Sin-u’s trembling look, and Lee Bo-rim’s listless expression—each gaze stirred a strange mix of emotions. Instead of joining them immediately, I stopped walking. Kim Han-byeol, following close behind, halted as well.

“Took you long enough,” Park Dong-geol continued. “Anyway, you heard the situation on the way, right?”

“I did,” I replied.

“It just turned out this way. I know it’s tough, but try to understand. We’re all just trying to survive.”

As Park Dong-geol finished, I heard Lee Yu-jeong mutter a curse under her breath. Ignoring her, he strode toward me, extending a large hand. “Join our team. We can be friends. You and the lady behind you are both welcome.”

The tension in the air peaked as everyone awaited my response. Knowing their anxious anticipation, I ignored his hand and replied in a cold voice, “I can decide for myself who I want to be friends with. Thanks for the offer, but I’ll pass.”

Park Dong-geol didn’t even blink, and without retracting his hand, he turned to Kim Han-byeol. “And you?”

“I don’t trust you,” she said, also brushing him off.

As we moved past him, Park Dong-geol spoke in a mocking tone. “Hah, so that’s how it’s gonna be. I don’t know what that vixen told you, but you’ll regret this.”

“If you value your own life, you should value others’ too,” I shot back.

“Spouting nonsense. I went out of my way to consider you, and this is what I get? Fine, do whatever you want. Just don’t come begging to join us later.”

“That won’t happen.”

“Sin-u, Bo-rim, let’s go! Staying with those hypocritical bastards will only get us killed.”

So, they’d already exchanged names. Watching him drag Lee Sin-u and Lee Bo-rim away, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. I walked calmly toward the remaining group. Their eyes conveyed a mix of relief and an inexplicable warmth directed at me. An-hyeon let out a deep sigh and spoke. “Thanks for your hard work. As you can see… this is how it turned out.”

“Hmph, good riddance,” Lee Yu-jeong said sharply. “No need to feel down about it. They left because they wanted to. Let them do whatever—live or die, it’s their call.”

Her barbed words made me chuckle despite myself. As she said, they were the ones who left. And we weren’t abandoned—we were the ones who stayed.

There was a vast difference between those two.
