# Chapter 61: Mage and Alchemist (Rare)

It had been about thirty minutes since we managed to calm the kids down and resumed our journey. Despite the passage of time, the kids were still fidgeting with the weapons in their hands, as if the thrill of the recent battle with the Lengas lingered. The atmosphere, which had been subdued after encountering the corpses of novice Users, was now buzzing with energy. Satisfied, I wore a faint smile and quickened my pace.

The clearing where we had dealt with the Lengas revealed another passage. It was a pathway opposite the one we had entered through. We proceeded through it without any interference, delving deeper into the dungeon. While I couldn’t guarantee this straightforward structure would continue, the dungeon’s layout had been relatively simple so far.

Honestly, if the dungeon of the ancient alchemist Vivian was only this challenging, it would be considered quite easy. My mind drifted back to my first cycle as a novice User, exploring a labyrinth. Back then, I had recklessly ventured into a place even seasoned Users avoided, only to get lost and suffer for nearly three months. That grueling experience made the current dungeon feel almost trivial by comparison.

Comparing those desperate times to now, I let out a soft chuckle. The old me would never have imagined this. Back then, I approached every step with caution, meticulously checking for traps and monster routes, as if tapping a stone bridge before crossing. But now, I felt my wariness fading. My innate abilities had grown, and my accumulated experience made such meticulous caution feel stifling. More importantly, with time being short, there was a need for boldness to push forward quickly when necessary.

Being a dungeon in a small city, it was noticeably less difficult than expeditions in regular or major cities. I had braced myself for some tension since it was close to uncharted territory, but unlike places riddled with traps or monsters popping out at every step, this dungeon felt almost comfortable.

Reflecting on it, even the conquest of the Screaming Cave hadn’t been too challenging, except for *that guy* who appeared at the end. The memory of *that guy* suddenly emerging and wiping out half the caravan sent shivers down my spine. Still, I couldn’t afford to let my guard down completely, so I maintained basic vigilance as we pressed on.

Traces of the previous caravan’s passage extended this far, suggesting they had crossed the clearing. Since sneaking out wasn’t an option, it was likely the Lengas had been replenished. That implied the dungeon master possessed some degree of intelligence.

As I mulled over these thoughts and continued inward, we came across another clearing connected by a passage. This one, however, was significantly smaller than the Lenga clearing—barely a quarter of its size. It could hardly fit fifty people. Ahead, a sheer cliff loomed, with four gaping holes at its base. Without passing through one of those holes, further progress was impossible. In other words, we had to choose one and dive in.

As I stepped into the clearing and paused, the kids stopped behind me. Without hesitation, I activated my Third Eye and mana detection simultaneously. After carefully scanning the four holes, I nodded and was about to head toward the second cave when I noticed Sol staring blankly at the cliff. Sensing my gaze, she turned to me and tilted her head in that adorable way of hers. Her cuteness sparked an urge to pinch her cheeks, but with An-hyeon nearby, I restrained myself.

As I stood there, visibly deliberating, Yu-jeong, the group’s resident mood-maker, sidled up to me with a playful grin. I turned away, anticipating some mischief, but she matched my movement, sticking close. Spinning her dagger with a flourish, she spoke up.

“Oppaaa, are you trying to figure out which way to go?”

“…”

Taking my silence as agreement, Yu-jeong flashed a bright smile and continued.

“I’ve got a great idea.”

“What crazy plan are you cooking up now?”

“Hey! Why do you always assume I’m up to no good? Just trust me this time, okay? You just sit back and watch. I’ve got a *really* good idea.”

Her face was serious, but the slight upturn of her lips betrayed some mischievous intent. Still, her earnest, pleading eyes made it hard to dismiss her. I scanned the surroundings with my senses and detected nothing amiss.

I decided to let Yu-jeong have her way. Sometimes, she showed a surprising sharpness I couldn’t predict, and I figured it’d be a good chance for her to gain experience. Stepping back, I kept my mouth shut. Yu-jeong’s face lit up with triumph. She then turned to An-hyeon, who was twirling his spear with equal enthusiasm.

“Hyeon~?”

“Crazy.”

“N-no, I mean, there’s something I want to check.”

Yu-jeong’s sweet tone was met with An-hyeon’s blunt retort, and I could see a vein bulge on her smooth forehead. In the past, she’d have unleashed her sharp tongue, but she maintained a soft tone, though I could sense a subtle undercurrent of menace.

“…What is it?”

“Back during the Rite of Passage, remember what you said?”

“I say a lot of things.”

“About the city. Didn’t you say our Sol has, like, *insanely* good instincts?”

Sol, who had been distracted by her surroundings, perked up at the mention of her name. How could she be *this* adorable? I briefly entertained the thought of pinching her cheeks or tugging her ears before catching myself. What was I even thinking?

While I wrestled with my questionable thoughts, An-hyeon’s face lit up with enthusiasm, launching into a passionate spiel. The ultimate doting brother had returned.

“Oh, that? Yeah, totally. Her instincts are unreal, like…”

“I get it, I get it. We’ll hear the details later. But is it really reliable?”

“Absolutely! She’s spot-on every time.”

Perfect timing. I mentally gave Yu-jeong a thumbs-up for cutting him off at just the right moment. I let out a sigh of relief, though a nagging feeling told me things were about to go sideways. An-hyeon, sensing something off, tilted his head, but it was already too late. Yu-jeong, with a sly smile, turned and strutted toward Sol.

An-hyeon called out urgently, “Hey, wait! Yu-jeong! Hold on!”

But Yu-jeong ignored him, closing the distance to Sol, who was watching her approach with wide eyes. Sol wasn’t oblivious, though. Perhaps from experience or her 100-point Luck kicking in, she sensed trouble and darted behind me for cover. An-hyeon let out a relieved sigh, while Yu-jeong frowned briefly before softening her expression and speaking gently.

“Su-hyeon oppa, could you please carry Sol and place her at the far-left entrance over there?”

I heard An-hyeon and Sol gasp in unison behind me. My stomach churned, but since I’d decided to let Yu-jeong take the lead, I reluctantly picked Sol up. She clung tightly to my clothes, tilting her head with a puzzled look, as if floating question marks above her head. Her trusting, innocent expression made me feel a pang of guilt.

In the past, lifting her like this would’ve sent her into a panic or tears, but not anymore. She gazed at me with complete faith, as if saying, “Oppa would never let anything bad happen to me.” Feeling a swell of pride at being trusted by the future Priest of Radiance, I smugly carried her to the far-left entrance—one of the passages we absolutely shouldn’t take. For now, I decided to see what Yu-jeong would do next.

“Hyung?!” An-hyeon’s panicked voice came from behind, but I ignored it, gently stroking Sol’s head before stepping back. Sol continued to gaze at me with those clear, trusting eyes, devoid of any suspicion. Yu-jeong, watching this, gave a twisted smirk, as if annoyed by Sol’s innocence. I, too, felt a mischievous urge to tease her, to see those eyes waver.

With my permission given, An-hyeon could only stare helplessly, his face a mix of resignation and concern. Yu-jeong licked her lips slightly and approached Sol again, leaning in to whisper softly. I sharpened my hearing to eavesdrop.

“Alright, Sol. Go on inside.”

“Huh? Inside?”

“Yup. By yourself.”

“W-what? By myself? Just me? What about you and oppa?”

“That’s right. Me, oppa, and Hyeon will wait out here. You go in first, scout for anything dangerous, and come back. Su-hyeon oppa approved this, said it’s a great idea.”

Yu-jeong’s whisper was sly and coaxing. Overwhelmed, Sol responded in a tiny, mumbling voice. An-hyeon’s expression grew strange as he strained to hear their faint exchange but stayed put.

Sol, ever the pure soul, nodded once and fell into deep thought. She closed her eyes, tapping her cheek with a finger, as if carefully mulling over Yu-jeong’s words. After a moment, she opened her eyes, her gaze trembling as she spoke.

“But… there are dangerous things inside… Going alone… Su-hyeon oppa wouldn’t…”

“No, no, you’ve got an important role. You’re the bait. Bait, got it? Like in the movies. Your sacrifice will help us avoid danger, grab the treasure, and head back to the city all happy. Sounds good, right?!”

Yu-jeong kept emphasizing “bait,” and Sol’s face crumpled into a teary expression as she looked to me for confirmation. She seemed convinced I’d never agree to such a thing. Meeting her pleading gaze, I merely shrugged. Sol blinked a few times, then spoke again.

“Oppa.”

“…Yeah?”

“Is that true?”

“W-what?”

I hadn’t actually agreed to anything out loud. But my hesitant tone must have sounded like a confirmation to Sol, whose eyes widened in shock. Her lips trembled, and she clenched her fists. With a final, desperate look, she spoke again.

“I’m gonna cry.”

I averted my gaze. Part of it was payback for her dodging my look earlier, and part of it was a twisted curiosity to see her cry. As I scratched my cheek and looked away, Sol’s face transformed into something almost theatrical. She hadn’t expected me to avoid her gaze, and the betrayal hit hard. Her mouth opened wide in shock, and then it happened—the moment I’d secretly hoped for.

“Waaaaah!”

Sol collapsed to the ground, sobbing uncontrollably. Yu-jeong, not expecting her to actually cry, stepped back with a stunned expression. An-hyeon shot her a sharp glare. Yu-jeong stammered, then pointed at me, as if to say, “What did *I* do?” 

“Waaah! Waaaah! Waaaaah!”

As Sol wailed, An-hyeon and I rushed to her side.
