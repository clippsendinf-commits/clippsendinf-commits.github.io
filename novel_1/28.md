# Memorize - Chapter 27: A Meeting with Familiar Faces

Four people emerged from the dense thicket: three men and one woman. Their hair was disheveled, their clothes tattered, resembling beggars. Not that our group looked much better, so I had no intention of mocking them.

I quickly scanned the four for distinctive traits. The man on the far left had a short, sporty haircut and held a long bow in his right hand—likely an archer. His lips were tightly shut, and his sunken eyes observed us with a quiet intensity, suggesting a reserved personality.

*Huh...?*

For some reason, he seemed oddly familiar. If he was someone I remembered from Hall Plane, that meant he was a notable figure. His face was somewhat common, but I decided to let it pass for now and shifted my gaze clockwise.

Next was the man at the forefront, with hair almost reaching his waist. His slender face and lithe frame could easily be mistaken for a woman’s from behind. However, his sharp jawline and piercing eyes clearly marked him as male.

In the middle stood a woman who appeared to be protected by the group. Her refined features caught my eye. She was staring at us with an anxious expression while scanning her surroundings, as if searching for something.

Finally, on the far right was a man twirling a dagger, baring his teeth in a grin. His cocky demeanor was immediately off-putting.

A brief silence hung in the air before the man in front glanced at us. In a hoarse voice, he spoke, “They seem like survivors, like us.”

“We’ve met survivors before. Nothing surprising,” the archer replied in a stiff tone.

The dagger-twirling man smirked, eyeing us. “Tch, tch… Early twenties, huh? Just kids… Poor things.”

His words provoked An-hyeon, who bristled and raised his shield, stepping forward. I quickly grabbed his shoulder and shook my head, signaling him to stay calm. Thankfully, he understood, grinding his teeth but stepping back. The cocky man let out a mocking chuckle, widening his eyes.

“Did you see that guy? The thug-looking one. He got all riled up at my words. Man, can’t even take a jab. Scary stuff.”

“You started it,” the archer snapped. “Shut up and let Jeong-min handle this.”

“…Tch.”

The dagger-twirler pouted but fell silent at the archer’s rebuke. However, our group’s faces had already hardened. Being treated as if we didn’t matter while they bickered among themselves was understandably irritating.

As tension began to rise, the long-haired man spoke again. “Nice to meet you. I’m Woo Jeong-min. As you can probably tell, I’m someone who ended up in this wretched place by chance.”

*Woo Jeong-min. The Red Fang Clan Lord?*

A flash of memory jolted me. The guy known as a demon, wielding dual daggers as his trademark. Could this really be *that* Woo Jeong-min standing before me?

I hurriedly activated my Third Eye.

Woo Jeong-min’s stats shattered my assumption that no one in the Rite of Passage could surpass An-hyeon. The realization that the man before me was indeed the future leader of the Red Fang Clan, a key figure in the allied forces, left me stunned.

“…An-hyeon. Likewise,” An-hyeon replied curtly, prompting a stir among Woo Jeong-min’s group. Ignoring them, I subtly heightened my senses. If this was really Woo Jeong-min, I had a hunch about the archer’s identity too—at least, the one who’d later claim a spot among Hall Plane’s Ten Strongest.

For a fleeting moment, I considered killing him. But I quickly dismissed the thought. If I were alone, I might’ve acted without hesitation, but with the kids here, it wasn’t feasible. Before I knew it, both our group and Woo Jeong-min’s had drawn weapons, facing off.

The dagger-twirler sneered at An-hyeon. “Kids like you need to be polite if you want to survive. Didn’t your parents teach you manners?”

“Oppa, we don’t have time to fight,” the woman in the center spoke up for the first time.

“This won’t take long. Killing’s quick. Just stay quiet,” he shot back.

Her sharp glare silenced him momentarily. He smacked his lips but nodded. “Alright, alright. Stop glaring. I’ll behave—before you eat me alive. Kidding, kidding! Geez, can’t take a joke… Anyway, you brats. I’m Cheon Seung-hyeon. Got a question for you. Those five monkeys—did you kill them?”

“And if we did?” I replied.

*Cheon Seung-hyeon. You’re dead if we meet in Hall Plane.* As I thought this, a sharp, clear voice cut through the air, laced with venom. I’d hoped Yu-jeong would stay out of it, but of course, she didn’t. With her strong pride, there was no way she’d let someone like Cheon Seung-hyeon—an upgraded version of Park Dong-geol—get away with his attitude.

Her words made him blink, then burst into laughter. “Pfft, hahaha! Oh man… Hold it, hold it. This prickly little girl. I’ll let it slide *this* time. But we’re not in a great mood, and we’re *really* busy, got it? So just answer our questions honestly, and we’ll part ways nicely. Oh, and watch your tone. Or don’t—I won’t warn you again.”

Yu-jeong’s face twisted into her signature sneer. “Crazy bastard. What’s with this pathetic loser acting all high and mighty? What a joke.”

Her sharp tongue was as refreshing as ever. Cheon Seung-hyeon was, in a way, cut from the same cloth as Park Dong-geol. As she spat venom, he stared at us, sighed, and picked up his dagger. I tightened my grip with my left hand.

“Kids and girls only listen when you beat them. Anyway, see ya.”

Muttering, Cheon Seung-hyeon raised his right hand and swung it down toward Yu-jeong. In that instant, I saw the dagger he’d been playing with streak toward her forehead. Just as I moved to pull her back, An-hyeon, who’d been warily watching, stepped forward with his shield raised, blocking her.

*Clang!*

*Ping! Thud.*

“Arghhh!”

The dagger struck the shield with a metallic ring and fell. At the same time, Cheon Seung-hyeon collapsed, clutching his right hand where an arrow had pierced it. The situation was simple: while An-hyeon blocked the dagger, I adjusted my aim and shot an arrow at him.

I didn’t expect the others to stand idle. Sensing the archer nocking an arrow to target me, I prepared to fire first, but heard only the *twang* of an empty bowstring. In a rush, I drew on my full strength, loaded three arrows, and aimed my crossbow at his forehead while activating my Third Eye.

**User Information (PLAYER STATUS)**

*Click! Clack!*

Seon Yu-un. It was him—the archer who’d claim a spot among Hall Plane’s Ten Strongest. Though I’d fired at another target and reloaded, creating a slight delay, my stats far surpassed his. Yet, Seon Yu-un managed to aim at my head almost simultaneously. I was marginally faster, and he seemed to realize it, his eyes wavering unlike their earlier stoic calm.

A chilling tension settled over both groups. Silence lingered, but I could feel An-hyeon, Yu-jeong, and Han-byeol gripping their weapons tightly, ready to fight if needed. Their resolve warmed me inwardly. Meanwhile, Cheon Seung-hyeon was rolling on the ground, shrieking and making a scene.

“Argh, arghhh! Kill him! Kill that bastard right now! I said kill him!”

“You threw the dagger first, Seung-hyeon. Shut up, you embarrassment,” Woo Jeong-min snapped coldly.

Whimpering, Cheon Seung-hyeon clutched his hand. I glanced at Yu-jeong, who was trembling slightly—she hadn’t expected him to actually throw the dagger. Woo Jeong-min, who’d been quietly observing, gave Cheon Seung-hyeon a pitying look before turning to us.

“I apologize first. Can we call it even? This isn’t benefiting either of us.”

“I’d like to, but your friend hasn’t lowered his bow,” I replied.

“Seon Yu-un, stand down. Release the string and lower it,” Woo Jeong-min ordered, raising his hand to force Seon Yu-un’s bow down. After a brief glance at me, Seon Yu-un complied. Once I confirmed they’d lowered their weapons, I slowly lowered my left arm, though neither of us had fully disarmed. Woo Jeong-min looked at our group, raised both hands, and stepped forward, speaking in a weary tone.

“Sorry. They’re not usually like this, but we’ve had a rough time lately, so they’re on edge. I have a question, and we’re short on time. Can I get to the point?”

My group turned to me, even An-hyeon. I nodded slightly. “That’s what I want.”

“Those monkeys were ones we’d been tracking since yesterday. We stepped away briefly for some reason, and in that time, one of our group was kidnapped by them. Thanks for dealing with them, but have you seen a woman around here?”

A female user… Could it be?

I recalled the woman from the entrance, raped by the Mangi and driven to suicide.

“Oppa, are you talking about the woman with the yellow cloth scraps? The one with long hair down to her back?” Yu-jeong blurted out.

I sighed, covering my face with both hands. Did this girl ever *think* before speaking? How could someone be so clueless? I mentally clicked my tongue as their group’s faces lit up, immediately pressing us. The loudest was the woman who’d mentioned time constraints earlier.

“Yes! That’s her! Yellow clothes, long straight hair! Do you know where she is?”

“Uh… well…” Yu-jeong faltered, her voice trailing off.

The others exchanged glances, saying nothing. It was likely the woman we saw at the Mangi-infested entrance, raped and dead. But admitting she’d been violated and killed felt awkward. As we hesitated, the men’s expressions hardened, likely guessing what came next. Still, the woman pleaded desperately.

“Did you pass her by? Even a glimpse? Please, I’m begging you. Tell me where you saw her. She’s my little sister. She’s so kind… so pure… *sob*…”

Tears welled in her eyes, and my group turned to me again. These kids, so eager to fight earlier, were now dumping this mess on me. With a heavy sigh, I spoke slowly.
