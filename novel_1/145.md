# MenTal IllNess

Choi Ju-hyeon wept bitterly for a while. However, as I neither offered comfort nor took any action, she gradually began to quiet her sobs. Listening to the slowly subsiding cries, I sank into thought for a moment.

What should I do? When I first entered this place, I had anticipated an attack or perhaps being lured into a trap. But instead, they had backed off, opting to plant one of their own among us. It seemed unnecessary, but regardless, I decided to adjust my approach slightly. They were probably watching silently from the surroundings right now. If so, I’d have to force them to come out.

Choi Ju-hyeon wiped the tear stains from her cheeks and spoke in a choked voice.

“Until just a moment ago, I was ready to die, but thank you so much for saving me. Now that I’ve been given a chance to live, as a person—not just a user—I’m starting to feel a bit greedy. Could you protect me just one more time? Those vagrants will definitely attack again. I know what my group did was wrong, and I’m truly sorry, but I want to avenge my fallen comrades who died so senselessly.”

Seeing my troubled expression, Choi Ju-hyeon pleaded with an even more pitiable look. Her words implied she wanted to join our group. Naturally, I had no intention of allowing that, so I placed my hands on both of her arms. She flinched slightly.

“Your situation is unfortunate, but in a way, you’re no different from those vagrants—another user. Taking in someone like that so carelessly is quite difficult for us.”

“But if I’m left alone again, I’ll surely be attacked once more. Or I’ll fall to monsters without even putting up a fight. I know it’s a shameless request, but please, at least let me assist from the sidelines when the vagrants come back. I have some information about them, even if it’s just a little, and I’m sure it’ll be helpful.”

As she recited her lines like a memorized script, I took another step closer.

Deep in the night, deep in the mountains, stood a naked female user. Perhaps due to the recent intimacy, a subtle heat lingered in the clearing. As we locked eyes, I slowly scanned her face and body from top to bottom. Choi Ju-hyeon was quite pretty, the kind of beauty who’d be called stunning in the modern world. After appraising her for a moment, I spoke in a voice that might sound a bit sleazy.

“Well, even without all that, I think there’s something you could help with.”

With a smirk, I slid my hand along her soft skin. Surprisingly, her expression didn’t change much. Had she anticipated this move? She bit her lip tightly, lowered her eyes slightly, and then slowly parted her small lips.

“It’s a body I’ve already discarded. If you’ll protect me properly… fine. Do as you please.”

She finished speaking and slowly lowered the arms covering herself. Her full breasts and pronounced curves came into view. But, to be frank, I had no intention of embracing her. If I’d planned to recruit her, I would’ve at least given her some clothes by now.

Deciding it was time to act, I continued in a gentle tone.

“There seems to be a misunderstanding. I don’t want to.”

“What?”

“I said I don’t want to. Embracing a filthy body like yours would be an insult to my manhood. So, no thanks.”

“W-what do you mean? Then how—”

Choi Ju-hyeon stammered, her face filled with confusion. I stopped sliding my hand along her soft skin, gripped both her arms tightly, and squeezed. She let out a faint groan of pain, her brow furrowing.

Then, I whispered slyly into her ear.

“Like this.”

As soon as I finished speaking, I exerted great force on the arms I was holding. *Riiip!* A harsh tearing sound echoed, accompanied by a piercing scream that rang through the clearing. Unable to maintain her balance from the sudden dismemberment, Choi Ju-hyeon staggered. I dropped what I was holding, grabbed her hair, and forced her to stand upright.

“Ahh…! Argh! Aaaargh!”

“Ju-hyeon!”

As Choi Ju-hyeon’s pain-filled screams resounded, a dark figure leapt out from the bushes. It was Kim Seung-beom, the one I’d seen earlier, rushing out with a frantic expression. He must’ve pretended to leave but stayed hidden nearby when I didn’t follow.

Pointing a trembling finger at me, his face twisted in horror.

“You! You bastard!”

“Oh, you’re back. Vagrant.”

“What have you done, you son of a bitch!”

“Hm? Oh, didn’t you say she was following us? So I figured I’d kill her. What’s the problem?”

“It hurts! It hurts! Help me! Seung-beom, help meee! Aaaargh!”

When I asked with a smug expression, Kim Seung-beom stared at me, momentarily speechless. But at Choi Ju-hyeon’s screams, he snapped back, grinding his teeth and growling.

“You bastard…! Let Ju-hyeon go now, or I’ll make you die in the most painful way possible.”

“What? That’s rich coming from a rapist. Don’t tell me you’ve already grown attached?”

“Stop talking and send her over here now, damn it!”

Kim Seung-beom’s face was flushed with rage. I shrugged once and replied calmly.

“Alright, I’ll give her to you.”

I slowly moved my hand to Choi Ju-hyeon’s neck. As I did, a strange expression crossed his face. The moment my grip closed around her delicate, deer-like neck, I clenched my fist with the same force I’d used on Jeong Ji-yeon, channeling all 94 points of my strength stat.

*Crack! Crunch!*

“Guh! Gaaah!”

“Here you go.”

*Thud.* *Roll.*

Her neck, utterly shattered, rolled toward him like a bowling ball, leaving a thin trail of blood across the grass. Kim Seung-beom stared blankly at the rolling head, then, as if struck by immense shock, slowly sank to his knees.

“Ju… Ju-hyeon.”

“So her name was Ju-hyeon. Pretty name.”

“No, no, this can’t be. Ju-hyeon. Ju-hyeon? Answer me, Ju-hyeon. Ju-hyeon… Ju-hyeoooon!”

Like a man possessed, Kim Seung-beom kept calling her name, then let out a desperate, ear-splitting wail. His wild eyes suggested he was about to charge at me. Humming a tune, I calmly raised my sword, ready to shove it into his screeching mouth the moment he came close.

That’s when it happened.

“Calm yourself, Kim Seung-beom.”

A husky voice cut through the darkness, stopping Kim Seung-beom just as he was about to rush me. At the same time, figures began emerging one by one from behind rocks, trees, and bushes. The main event had finally arrived.

One, two, three, four, five. Including Kim Seung-beom and the late Choi Ju-hyeon, that made seven. Having already scanned them with my Third Eye, I wasn’t surprised. Instead, I quickly assessed their classes and stats.

“Hm.”

Nothing impressive. Some had decent experience and stats, but that was it. Strictly speaking, none were a match for me. This gave me even more confidence. Was this how Cha Seung-hyeon felt facing 800 users?

While I was lost in thought, Kim Seung-beom struggled, shaking off the hands restraining him.

“That bastard, he killed Ju-hyeon!”

“I know. It seems our plan’s been seen through. So calm down. He’s already surrounded.”

The user before me had a gentle demeanor but a dark edge. At his soothing words, Kim Seung-beom took a deep breath and rose roughly. He’d somehow equipped simple clothes and his weapon. The despair in his eyes quickly turned to murderous intent.

I calmly surveyed the group. One swordsman, one archer, one axe warrior, one mage, one battle priest, one regular priest. With the late Choi Ju-hyeon, they’d formed a decent caravan. The mage, who’d appeared first, spoke to me with a grim expression.

“I didn’t expect you to see through our plan. I thought something was off when you switched the watch, but I never imagined this.”

“Heh. Your plan wasn’t bad. The actors’ performances were the problem.”

“Hypocritical bastard. I was going to leave you alone until we found new gains, but no need for that now. Let’s see if you can keep that smug look when we catch you.”

“Catch me? Not kill me outright?”

When Kim Seung-beom sharply interjected at the mage’s words, the mage chuckled darkly. Except for Kim Seung-beom, the others seemed unfazed, confirming they were indeed vagrants. Kim Seung-beom was likely Choi Ju-hyeon’s lover or something close.

“Don’t worry. We’ll kill them all eventually. But first, we catch this guy and ambush the rest. Kill the men, and the women… heh heh heh. I saw some fine ones in the city. Lucky bastards.”

“Don’t joke. I don’t care what you think, but Ju-hyeon was my… ugh. I’m killing him now.”

“Calm down. I’m not heartless about a fallen comrade. First, we cut off his limbs and make him watch as we rape his women. Then, we slit their throats one by one in front of him. How’s that?”

Seemingly tempted, Kim Seung-beom stopped, his face contorted, and nodded a couple of times, grinding his teeth.

“Fine. That’s not bad. No, it’s a great idea. I’ll pay him back in kind.”

As Kim Seung-beom raised his sword with a slightly softened attitude, the others, who’d been watching quietly, began chiming in.

“Just so you know, that whiny priest girl is mine. I love the type that cries under me.”

“I want the feisty, talkative one. I’m curious how she’ll scream beneath me. Heh heh.”

For the record, five of the six were men. The only woman, holding a bow silently, was likely the archer tracking us, her face hidden under a hood. While the men traded crude banter, she remained quiet.

Ignoring their self-indulgent chatter, I slowly raised my sword. The cast was all here; it was time to bring down the curtain. A story with everything revealed loses its thrill. Seeing me lift my sword, the mage, who seemed to be the leader, sighed and spoke.

“Trying to act tough, huh? I don’t get why you came here alone knowing our plan, but we’ll teach you the terror of the Hall Plane. Alright, guys, rough him up a bit. Just don’t kill him.”

“Raaaargh!”

The moment the mage finished, Kim Seung-beom charged with a roar. No stance, no technique—just a reckless rush relying on superior stats. Fool. I snorted and swung my sword downward, timing his approach. He raised his sword to block, diving inward, but my blade sliced through his and cleaved his head cleanly in two.

Kim Seung-beom collapsed without a sound. Instantly, a wave of shock rippled through the vagrants.

“Kim Seung-beom! Damn it! A cutting spell? He’s got a magic weapon… Don’t panic! Don’t rush in! Wait for my defensive spell! Use our numbers!”

“No, it’s not a cutting spell.”

Muttering lazily, I tilted my head slightly to the left, dodging an arrow that grazed past. Just as I’d done with the scorpions in the Black Forest, I lightly brushed my sword against the incoming arrow.

The arrow, originally flying straight, curved gently along the path of my force, piercing the neck of the stunned priest at the back. Perfect. A clean hit.

“Three down. Four left?”

“Crazy bastard! Hyeon-seung!”

“An So-yeon! What the hell was that?!”

“No, I-I aimed perfectly…”

Without moving a step, I’d taken out three. Only now did the vagrants grasp the situation, their faces flashing with alarm as they raised their weapons. But I wasn’t in the mood to indulge them further. I could take out at least one or two more before they organized.

With that thought, I charged at the mage like a beast starved for blood.
