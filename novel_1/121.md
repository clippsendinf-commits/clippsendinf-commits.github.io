# Memorize - Chapter 120: A Peaceful Daily Life

Upon entering the temple, I was not greeted by the users I had seen when I came with Vivian previously. 

“Greetings to the users who wield blessings. We welcome your visit. Please state your name and the purpose of your visit,” said a priest with neatly combed golden hair and a kind demeanor, bowing politely. The man before me was not a user but a resident. Since I wasn’t here to use a contract but to report on an expedition, I had no particular complaints. In some ways, dealing with residents for reports might even be preferable.

Users and residents generally share a relationship akin to nobles and commoners. However, in Hall Plane’s setting, residents designated as “helpers” are a different matter. There aren’t many residents chosen as such, but those in the temple are considered almost equal to users. Thus, I responded in a courteous tone.

“My name is Kim Su-hyeon, a Year 0 user. I’m here to report an expedition.”

“Oh, User Kim Su-hyeon. Please, come in.”

From a user’s perspective, the expedition reporting process is straightforward. The reporting user summarizes their expedition findings in a document and submits it. The temple’s residents then review the submitted report, asking questions about any parts they find lacking.

Once the process is complete, based on the submitted content, an investigation team may be formed if necessary. Typically, investigation teams are assembled when the expedition involves matters that threaten a city or when a user’s exploration qualifies for official recognition.

I handed the documents I had prepared in my spare time to the man with the gentle smile. Accepting them with a polite gesture, he began reading with a serious expression.

“Hmm.”

A soft groan escaped the resident as he read. When I glanced at him, I noticed his brow twitch slightly. If it had been one of those overbearing residents handling clan establishment, they might have thrown the report down and started shouting. The temple residents, however, were notably composed.

With a slight frown, as if uncertain, he spoke calmly.

“The report is remarkably well-crafted… I have no further questions. For a Year 0 user, it’s impressive, but… it’s hard to believe.”

Having finished reading, the resident carefully set the papers down. His expression was complex. Understandably so—under normal circumstances, an investigation team would have been dispatched to verify the claims, but the current situation didn’t allow for it. With the city’s leading clan absent, sending residents out without protection was unthinkable.

“If the temple organizes an investigation team, could you guide us to the locations in question?”

“That would be difficult. I have many tasks to handle during the preparation period, and I plan to head out on another expedition as soon as it’s over.”

At my firm refusal, he sighed with a troubled look. However, we had no obligation to guide an investigation team to those locations.

“Then, could you show us some evidence? Please don’t misunderstand—this is an extraordinary report, and the temple’s current situation isn’t ideal. If these claims are true, they’re significant matters that must be verified. To justify forming an investigation team, even under strain, we’d need concrete evidence.”

“No problem. What kind of evidence do you need?”

I nodded readily at his request. Showing evidence wasn’t difficult, and I understood their circumstances to some extent. When I asked what evidence he wanted, he briefly reviewed the report again and requested two items.

“The spider’s essence obtained from the dungeon in the Black Forest and the heart of the high-ranking demon Belphegor.”

I promptly retrieved two orbs from my pouch, each small enough to hold in one hand: a dark orb exuding murky demonic energy and a bluish-black orb radiating strange magical power. Upon seeing them, the resident’s eyes widened in astonishment.

After examining them closely for a moment, he looked up with a much more excited expression. Alternating glances between my face, the report, and the items, he smacked his lips and spoke.

“With all due respect, using the authority granted by the divine, I’ve confirmed that these items match the descriptions in your report. If all these claims are verified, it would be a tremendous achievement… but forming an investigation team right now is challenging.”

“Hmm. Is it impossible within two weeks? You mentioned pushing forward despite the strain…”

At my words, he shook his head with an apologetic expression.

“Two weeks is absolutely impossible. To be honest, even forming an investigation team is uncertain. Given Mul’s current state, it’s difficult, and requesting aid from nearby cities or Barbara isn’t feasible either, as you know the situation…”

He trailed off, gauging my reaction. I had anticipated this possibility, so I wasn’t shocked, but the disappointment was unavoidable. Founding a clan isn’t something you can just do on a whim. These reports needed to be verified to count as achievements for clan establishment, but if verification was delayed, it would mean further setbacks.

As my expression hardened, the resident bowed again, offering an apology.

“I’m truly sorry. Please understand our circumstances. Honestly, we’ve hardly accepted routine expedition reports lately. This time, two major reports came in so suddenly, so it’ll take twice as long. Moreover, since the Dungeon of the Ancient Alchemist wasn’t fully cleared, it’s far too dangerous for us to investigate alone.”

I clicked my tongue inwardly and decided to do what I could. Forcing the impossible wasn’t an option. I had hoped they might push through, but their idea of “pushing” was requesting aid from other cities. Smacking my lips, I responded.

“Sigh… Fine, then. Just please investigate as quickly as possible.”

“Thank you so much. As soon as the situation allows, we’ll prioritize investigating these two dungeons. Oh, and…”

“No need to worry about falsehoods. I know the penalties for falsifying a report of this scale. I’ll take my leave now.”

“Wait, just a moment!”

As I stood to leave, unwilling to waste more time, the resident called out urgently. I looked at him questioningly, wondering why he was stopping me.

“Of course, we’ll investigate thoroughly, and there’s a clause for that. But since you’ve already shown evidence, we’re inclined to trust you.”

“Oh, okay. Then why…?”

“We were planning to visit you around lunchtime today, but you’ve come at a perfect time. The one who assists with your blessing has sent an oracle. You should visit the Summoning Room.”

As expected. Hearing that Seraph was calling me, I nodded once, gathered the items from the table, and said, “Understood. I’ll head there now.”

“An excellent choice. I’ll guide you to the portal for the Summoning Room right away.”

After speaking, the resident stood, carefully tucking the report into his robes. As I followed him deeper into the temple, I thought of one particular angel.

It had been a while since I’d seen Seraph, but I felt neither excitement nor joy.

---

I stepped into the portal I had used to enter Hall Plane after passing the Rite of Passage. A shimmering sea-blue light flickered before my eyes. An intangible force pulled at my body, and as I passed through the portal, a familiar scene greeted me.

The Summoning Room, where everything began. This place never changes. After briefly scanning my surroundings, I turned my gaze forward and saw a familiar altar. Perched atop it was a beautiful angel with translucent wings gently fluttering, staring at me.

With a radiant face and hair glowing like moonlight, her emerald eyes sparkled. It was Seraph. The moment I saw her, my relatively calm mood plummeted to rock bottom. I felt a sense of relief realizing I still harbored dislike for angels. They were beings I could never bring myself to like.

Confirming my arrival, Seraph spoke in her usual serene voice.

“User Kim Su-hyeon. It’s been a while. How have you—”

“Get to the point.”

I cut off her greeting with a cold voice. Not only did I dislike angels, but I couldn’t see the Seraph from my first cycle and the one before me now as the same.

“…been faring?”

Despite my harsh response, she finished her sentence. Annoyed by this, I glared at her even more sharply.

“No need for pleasantries. You already know the gist of things, don’t you?”

“User Kim Su-hyeon.”

“I’m busy. Just say what you need and let me go.”

“…”

Seraph fell silent, as if struck mute. Her face remained composed, as always, but I could sense her inner turmoil.

“Nothing to say?”

“…”

Still no response. The Seraph I’d known for ten years was indeed different from this one. Shaking my head, I turned to leave. Staying here any longer might sour my improving temperament—or rather, revert it to its old state.

“If you’ve got nothing to say, I’m out. And next time, don’t waste my time like this.”

“User Kim Su-hyeon…”

I heard her call after me, but I deliberately ignored it. At that moment, a flash of light burst forth. Just as I was about to step into the portal, I sensed a massive surge of mana manifesting behind me.

*Zzt! Zzzt!*

Light flared repeatedly. The mana surge was enveloping the Summoning Room. This wasn’t an ordinary phenomenon. Turning back quickly, I saw Seraph glaring into the air with an angry expression.

“Stop it at once!”

Her shout wasn’t directed at me—she wasn’t even looking at me. What startled me, though, was that she ended her sentence with “-yo” instead of her usual formal “-da.” For Seraph, who rarely used such endings, this was unusual.

*Boom!*

With a wave of her hand, the gathering light distorted, and a sound like fireworks echoed. The mana that had been coalescing began to dissipate. Seraph swiftly and calmly dispelled the lights appearing around the room, all while continuing to speak as if in conversation.

“You have no authority here…!”

It was striking that she wasn’t using the angels’ private communication line. There was clearly some internal conflict. Amidst this, the Summoning Room was filled with flashing white lights, her hands slicing through the air, and bursts of light repeating.

*Zzt! Zzzt!*

“Sandalphon. This is my final warning. You are not permitted to summon here. This Summoning Room is for me and User Kim Su-hyeon alone. Unauthorized intrusions are forbidden.”

*Zzt… Zzzt…*

“This is my last warning. I, Seraph, am User Kim Su-hyeon’s designated angel. I have no intention of transferring him.”

*Zzt…*

With her final words, the lights filling the Summoning Room vanished completely. Seraph, who had been speaking, resumed muttering inaudibly, her angry expression settling back into calm.

Feeling like I’d just witnessed something interesting, I pulled a cigarette from my pocket. As I lit it and smoked, Seraph seemed to have resolved the issue. Since the situation seemed to have arisen because of me, leaving outright felt a bit off.

Finally, Seraph turned to me, letting out a short sigh upon seeing I was still there. I stared back at her impassively.

“User Kim Su-hyeon.”

“What.”

My tone remained sharp, and after a brief exchange of glances, she spoke in a soothing voice.
