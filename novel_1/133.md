# Chapter 132: Becoming More Mature

I nodded calmly, my face composed, as the matter of Yu-jeong was something I had already been considering. I signaled for An-hyeon to go ahead and speak, but he hesitated, opening and closing his mouth repeatedly. I waited patiently for him to find his words.

After a moment, An-hyeon swallowed hard and finally spoke.  
“Hyung, I’m not trying to snitch, but… Yu-jeong’s behavior lately, it’s been kind of extreme.”  

“Didn’t you tell me before to just let her be?” I replied with a slight smile.  

An-hyeon scratched his head awkwardly.  
“Yeah, well… Honestly, back then, I just said that because I wanted to agree with Yeon-ju-nim. I still don’t think Yu-jeong’s actions were right, but over the past couple of days, it feels like she’s crossed a line. The atmosphere’s been really off, too.”  

Yeon-ju-nim, huh? Has she already tamed An-hyeon? I clicked my tongue inwardly and pressed further.  
“What exactly is so extreme? Tell me more.”  

Seeing my interest, An-hyeon seemed to steel himself. His eyes resolute, he began to pour out his frustrations.  
“You’ve probably noticed, Hyung, but she barely talks to the rest of the group these days. Yesterday, Sol tried to strike up a conversation, and Yu-jeong completely ignored her and went upstairs. That’s not all—she hasn’t even come down to the first floor yesterday or today. Well, maybe she did when I wasn’t around, but I haven’t seen her training at all lately.”  

“Hmm,” I let out a low hum.  

An-hyeon glanced at me cautiously before continuing in a careful tone.  
“I know I said to just let her be before, but… we’ve been through a lot together. I think it’d be good if you gave her a sharp word before things get worse.”  

His words brought a faint smile to my lips. An-hyeon had changed a lot over time. The sharp edge he had during the Rite of Passage had softened, his disposition shifting toward Amity and Moderation, as if proving my thoughts. It seemed he couldn’t entirely ignore Yu-jeong, perhaps because of the bond—however contentious—formed through their time together.  

I nodded once at his request and spoke quietly.  
“You’re right. After all we’ve been through, it doesn’t make sense to just let this slide.”  

“Exactly!” An-hyeon’s face lit up as he responded eagerly.  

I gave him a gentle smile, but my voice turned cold as I continued.  
“Yeah. At the very least, she deserves one chance. Since you brought it up, we might as well deal with it now. An-hyeon, go get Yu-jeong and tell her to come to my room.”  

A flicker of panic crossed An-hyeon’s eyes. I had almost said “discard her” but softened it to “at least” to avoid sounding too harsh. This one chance was a kind of line I’d drawn for her. As long as she didn’t cross it, I was willing to keep guiding her. I understood her current state of mind and the feelings she held for me, but if she continued acting this way, no matter her potential or loyalty, my stance toward her would inevitably change. This was Hall Plane, after all.  

For now, I’d handle it my way, but if things didn’t work out, I’d lean more heavily on Yeon-ju’s advice. An-hyeon, perhaps sensing the shift in my mood, opened his mouth briefly but then answered with a reluctant expression.  
“She might be sleeping…”  

“Then wake her up and bring her here.”  

“W-What? Uh… Okay, Hyung. I’ll go get her.”  

Without waiting for my reply, he scurried out of the room. I pulled out a cigarette and lit it, then drew the magic sword Skrep from my chest. The rusted red blade pulsed with a chilling killing intent. I flicked the blade sharply.  

*Clang!*  

“What’s with all this murderous aura?”  

*Wooong!*  

“Oh, really?”  

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*  

*Woooong…*  

After three sharp flicks, Skrep reluctantly withdrew its killing intent. Looking at the now-quiet blade in my hand, I spoke softly.  
“Stay still. Your new master might be coming soon.”  

*Wooong. Woooong.*  

“I’m not lying. It’s true. Anyway, you’re fine, but… tone it down a bit.”  

*Wooong?*  

As the sword vibrated with a questioning hum, I growled.  
“I said tone it down. A little aggression is fine, but if you drive someone mad with bloodlust, I’ll toss you into the latrine or purify you at the temple. Got it?”  

*Wooong… Woooong. Woooong.*  

I pressed down on Skrep as it squirmed in my hand, waiting for An-hyeon. The sword resisted, clearly wanting me to wield it instead, but I had no intention of doing so. After a while, its plaintive vibrations faded, and it went limp.  

As I tapped the now-silent Skrep, I heard heavy footsteps stomping up the stairs. I stubbed out my cigarette and nudged the sword.  
“Hey, wake up. Your master’s coming.”  

*Wooong!*  

Skrep vibrated once in response, seemingly excited despite its earlier act of indifference.  

But my expectations were spectacularly dashed when the door swung open. It wasn’t Yu-jeong who entered but An-hyeon, his face flushed and breathing heavily, as if something had gone terribly wrong.  

“Hyung!” he shouted the moment he saw me, his voice thick with frustration and injustice.  

“What’s wrong? Where’s Yu-jeong?”  

“Don’t even get me started! I was an idiot for worrying about that crazy girl even for a second! Argh, I’m so pissed!”  

“What happened? Tell me.”  

“You don’t want to know! She didn’t come. I knocked and knocked, but she didn’t answer, so I forced my way in. She went completely hysterical! Scratching, hitting, cursing me out like crazy. I got kicked out!”  

An-hyeon thrust his arm toward me, still ranting. Sure enough, long scratch marks and handprints were vividly etched into his skin.  

I stared at his arm for a moment, then stood up quietly. As I walked toward the door, An-hyeon grabbed at me in a panic.  
“Hyung, don’t go now! Yu-jeong’s completely lost it. Even you might get hurt!”  

Yu-jeong, cursing and swinging at *me*? I snorted at the thought. The Yu-jeong I knew would never dare. And if she did…  

I paused at the door and asked in a low voice, “Is Yu-jeong on the third floor?”  

“No, she packed her stuff and moved to the second floor. But, Hyung, seriously—”  

“If she won’t come, I’ll go to her. Thanks for trying. Leave this to me and go rest.”  

An-hyeon tried to stop me again, but I cut him off firmly. He fidgeted, clearly uneasy about my mood, but I turned and left the room without another word.  

“Hyung…”  

His anxious voice trailed after me, but I didn’t respond.  

As An-hyeon had said, there was no sign of Yu-jeong on the third floor. I descended to the second floor and unleashed a wide-range detection spell, channeling as much mana as I could. A surge of magical energy swept through the floor, and I immediately headed toward the room at the far end of the left corridor where I sensed her.  

I stopped in front of her door and knocked lightly twice.  

*Knock, knock.*  

I half-expected silence, but to my relief, Yu-jeong answered immediately.  
“Get lost.”  

*Knock, knock, knock, knock.*  

“Goddamn it, I said get lost! Are you deaf? You crazy bastard!”  

She must have mistaken me for An-hyeon. Her coarse language, which I hadn’t heard in a while, felt oddly refreshing. Feeling a bit mischievous, I decided to knock again, this time with a rhythm.  

*Knock, knock. Knock-knock-knock. Knock-knock.*  

Her voice grew even more irritated.  
“For fuck’s sake, get lost, you bastard! Stop spouting nonsense and go jerk off to that girl with your spear! God, what a fucking lunatic, bothering me like this!”  

Her explosive cursing made me chuckle. I turned the handle and opened the door. Inside, I saw Yu-jeong lying on the bed, completely buried under a blanket up to her head. Though she couldn’t see me, the blanket twitched as if she’d kicked it hard, sensing someone had entered.  

As I slowly approached the bed, her sharp, muffled voice rang out.  
“I’m warning you. If you want to get beat up like before, try touching me again. Lay a single finger on me, and we’re both done for.”  

“…”  

“I told you not to come. If you’re going to keep talking crap, just leave.”  

Talking crap, huh? What exactly had An-hyeon said to make her call it that? I guessed he’d been pretty harsh when he tried to bring her to me. Curiosity tugged at me, but I figured the details would come out eventually. I stepped right up to her bedside.  

Standing close, I reached for where I assumed her head was under the blanket. Without hesitation, my hand slipped beneath it.  

“…!”  

The moment my palm brushed against her soft hair, her body jolted. I gently stroked her hair—once, twice, three times, four, five…  

“Ugh…”  

After more than ten strokes, her trembling began to subside. By now, she likely realized it wasn’t An-hyeon. In fact, she seemed to have figured out it was me. It was almost amusing how she could tell it was me just from the touch of my hand.  

“…Oppa…?”  

After a long, awkward silence, Yu-jeong was the first to speak. I gave her hair a gentle squeeze to confirm it was me, then let go.  

When I tried to lift the blanket, a weak hand held it down, refusing to let it budge. She was clinging to it tightly. With a soft smile, I spoke in a gentle tone.  
“Yu-jeong, lift the blanket. Let me see your face for a bit.”  

She shook her head vigorously, the lump under the blanket swaying back and forth. When I tried again, she pressed down harder. I wasn’t using much force, and neither was she. I could have pulled it off with a bit more effort, but I didn’t want to force her.  

After about a minute of this quiet tug-of-war, the blanket began to tremble slightly. Her grip loosened, and I took the chance to pull it back.  

There she was, face buried in the bed, her shoulders shaking intermittently. She was crying, stifling her sobs.  

“Yu-jeong, let’s talk.”  

I spoke softly, gently trying to turn her head, but she resisted weakly, refusing to lift her face. After persistent efforts, she finally relented, revealing a glimpse of her face.  

Her eyes were tightly shut, her lips bitten hard. Clear tears streamed from her closed eyes. I sat lightly on the edge of the bed.  

“Aaah…”  

The moment she fully turned her head, Yu-jeong let out the sobs she’d been holding back. Tears poured down her face as she wept openly. Watching her, I spoke in a calm, steady voice.
