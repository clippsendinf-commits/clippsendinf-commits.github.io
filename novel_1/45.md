# Chapter 44: Preparations for Takeoff

"We’re both toiling in the shadows. Even though we’re enemies… anyway, nice to meet you."  
"Hm. I’ve heard a lot about you. Han So-yeong, the Commander of the Battlefield. And you’re the Sword Master under her command? Jin Su-hyeon, was it?"  
"Ah, my bad. Kim Su-hyeon, not Jin Su-hyeon."  
"Maybe. If I’d met her first, I might’ve joined her right away. She’s that captivating a User."  
"Your sense of humor’s pretty lame. I’m not complaining about where I am now. And I don’t have a hobby of betraying people."

The Warp Gate, thankfully, was still maintaining its fare discount policy. Normally, it’d cost 2 Gold per person, totaling 8 Gold for the four of us, but with a 50% discount, we only had to pay 4 Gold to use it.  
The kids were visibly fascinated as they stepped into the portal, its surface rippling with gentle waves. You’d think they’d be used to it by now, having gone through it a few times during the Rite of Passage. Yet, here they were, craning their necks and gawking like they were advertising, “I’m a total newbie User!”  
Such small behaviors could make them targets for vagrants, and I was tempted to warn them. But I didn’t want to come off as a nagging mom right from the start, so I clamped my half-open mouth shut.  
As I fully submerged myself in the portal, a cool sensation enveloped my body, like diving naked into the sea. I closed my eyes quietly, savoring the pure energy filling my entire being. When I opened them again, the scenery had changed—my eyes were greeted by the shabby landscape of a small city.  
We had arrived in Mul.  
Mul was hard to call prosperous, even as a compliment. The kids’ reactions were especially telling. After living in Barbara, with its neat roads, clean buildings, and vibrant, grand atmosphere, seeing this rundown city seemed to leave them speechless.  
A frontier city like Mul catching up to Barbara was a pipe dream, unless its leading clan head had extraordinary skill. Leading the kids, I stepped onto the uneven, ochre-colored dirt path and started walking.  
The streets of Mul were mostly quiet. The few Users we saw were mostly clad in shoddy equipment. Even considering it was the time of day—morning transitioning to noon—when most would be out of the city, you couldn’t expect to see Users at every step like in a big city. (Not that I was expecting that to begin with.)  
Yu-jeong, looking unfamiliar with her surroundings, glanced around curiously before asking me in a questioning tone, “Oppa, what do we do now? Are we heading straight out of the city?”  
What a ridiculous question. We needed a place to return to first. I shook my head.  
“No. First, we need to secure an inn to use as our base camp for a while.”  
“Base camp? An inn?”  
“Unless we’re registered as an official clan, getting a house or even a clan house will be tough. For now, think of the inn as our home.”  
I was planning to head to an inn anyway, both to eat breakfast and lunch. The kids might not realize it, but for someone just setting foot in the Hall Plane, this wasn’t a bad start. Users who couldn’t join a clan or got kicked out of the User Academy would struggle just to scrape by day-to-day.  
If you wanted to know the most sensitive place for information flow in a city, a pub would come to mind first. But I had a specific reason for choosing an inn. Back in my first cycle in the Hall Plane, I briefly stayed in Mul, and there was an inn I stayed at without much thought.  
At the time, I didn’t think much of it and just passed through, but later I had the chance to confirm a surprising fact about that inn.  
Recalling those memories, I walked along the main road for a while before stopping in front of a shabby-looking inn. The kids following me stopped as well. The faded signboard read *The Modest Lady*—an odd name. Feeling confident I’d found the right place, I gave a faint smile and was about to step inside when—  
*Crash! Thud!*  
“Arghhh! Sarah, save me!”  
A loud commotion erupted from inside the inn, and a male User with a scruffy beard burst out, flinging the door open. His face screamed panic as he stumbled out, practically tripping over himself. He rolled right in front of us but sprang up with almost acrobatic skill and fled without looking back.  
I could roughly guess what had happened and let out a chuckle, but the kids just stared blankly in the direction he’d run off to.  
“Don’t just stand there gawking, come on in,” came a slightly husky but distinctly feminine voice from inside the inn.  
Dragging the dazed kids inside, I saw the interior in complete disarray. Scattered dishes and tables were the least of it—broken chairs and overturned tables were more notable. An-hyeon let out a groan at the sight.  
In the center of the hall stood a woman with a composed expression. She wore a languid smile, looking thoroughly satisfied with something. The one thing that stood out compared to other Users was the faint ashen tint in her hair.  
She glanced at me briefly, then slowly surveyed our entire group before speaking.  
“New faces, huh? Are you customers?”  
Her refined lips let out a soft, almost melting voice that could make any man weak in the knees. An-hyeon’s face was already turning red, betraying himself. This guy’s at it again. Immune to such charms, I replied calmly, “Yes, we’re customers.”  
“Food? Lodging?”  
“Both. We’d like to eat first, though.”  
At my response, she gave a gentle smile and said, “I like polite men. Alright, kids, it’s a bit of a mess here, so it might be tricky. Go sit over there and wait.”  
I obediently took the seat she pointed to. The kids, initially too startled to notice much, started looking around curiously once they settled down.  
*The Modest Lady* was an inn I hadn’t seen in a while. It had three floors: the first was a lobby and dining area, while the second and third were for lodging. Notably, aside from us, there wasn’t a single other User in the inn.  
Soon, the woman approached our table with a beaming smile. The table and chairs were still a mess, but she casually tossed down water, cups, and a menu, and miraculously, they spun once and landed neatly in the center of the table. The kids’ eyes widened in astonishment.  
“There’s the menu, but… you can order something not on it too. I can make most things. What do you want to eat?”  
The kids all turned to me at once. I glanced at the menu briefly but already knew what to order. I’d only skimmed it for show.  
“A-course, for four, please.”  
“Well, well. Handsome kids with good taste. The A-course will be out soon, so just wait a bit.”  
Flaunting her explosive figure, she sauntered into the kitchen. An-sol was staring at me with a sulky expression, and Yu-jeong’s face looked off too. Only An-hyeon gazed at me with envious eyes.  
“Oppa, this place feels weird. Why did we come here?”  
“Yeah, it’s strange. Can’t we just go somewhere else?”  
Yu-jeong spoke with a displeased expression, and An-sol quickly chimed in, nodding in agreement. I tilted my head, surprised they’d suggest leaving. Was it *that* weird? Before I could respond, An-hyeon, not wanting to be outdone, said hurriedly, “I mean, it seems fine to me. Doesn’t feel that weird. Do we really need to go somewhere else?”  
The moment he finished, both female Users shot him glares. Yu-jeong’s look said, *Of course you’d say that*, while An-sol’s was filled with disappointment toward her own brother. Flinching under their stares, An-hyeon coughed awkwardly and changed the subject.  
“Uh, I’m pretty hungry. Let’s eat first and then talk…”  
“Yeah, right. Did you fall for her at first sight or what?”  
An-hyeon didn’t respond, just turned his head to stare at some distant mountain (or so it seemed). Yu-jeong, shifting her target, turned her sharp tone on me. An-sol, who’d been grumpy since the Barbara plaza, was also muttering uncharacteristically.  
“Hmph. I don’t like her calling us ‘kids.’ We’re not babies!”  
As An-sol spoke, Yu-jeong gave her a startled glance. I’d been thinking of An-sol as a kid too, so I didn’t have much to say. Yu-jeong scratched her head, still grumbling. Why were they acting like this?  
“If we’re going to an inn, we should’ve gone to a proper one. This place is obviously weird. It’s a mess, and that guy ran out like his life depended on it!”  
*Your personality’s weirder. I can’t figure you out.* I barely suppressed the urge to say that and forced a weak smile. Unhappy with my reaction, Yu-jeong kept muttering, and just as she and An-sol were about to start badmouthing me and An-hyeon in duet—  
*Swish.*  
“Eek!”  
Yu-jeong let out a bizarre yelp, nearly collapsing. Standing behind her was the woman, holding a plate in one hand. An-hyeon and An-sol also looked like they might faint upon seeing her. They hadn’t sensed her presence despite her being so close. Truly, life is a battlefield.  
With her signature languid eyes and soft voice, the woman spoke.  
“Oh my… that’s the first time I’ve heard such a unique scream.”  
“You cra—?!”  
Yu-jeong, incensed by the woman’s calm demeanor, was about to let her temper flare but stopped dead, her eyes widening like saucers. The woman had bent down, wrapping an arm around Yu-jeong’s shoulder and pulling her into an embrace. Yu-jeong’s face ended up buried in the woman’s chest.  
“Kid.”  
As Yu-jeong struggled to speak, a faint aura rose from the woman’s body. It quickly enveloped the area, turning into a heavy, oppressive air. The moment the atmosphere shifted, An-hyeon, An-sol, and Yu-jeong froze, their faces stiffening.  
The woman brought her lips close to Yu-jeong’s ear and whispered, “Curious why that guy ran out like his life depended on it?”  
Yu-jeong didn’t answer. Or rather, she *couldn’t* answer.  
I stayed out of it, observing the situation. What the woman was doing was a basic *Mana Emission*, something Users with a talent for magic could do. Her subtle, silent domination of the surroundings with her mana was impressive, and I couldn’t help but admire it inwardly. Plus, I figured this was a chance to tame Yu-jeong’s attitude a bit. Killing two birds with one stone, as they say.  
“He came in and told me to take his order… Guess what he said he wanted to eat?”  
The air around the table was thick with an uneasy, suffocating tension. It was almost hard to breathe. An-hyeon and Yu-jeong might not have noticed, but An-sol, with her abilities, should’ve been able to resist somewhat. Seeing her trembling in panic, I thought again that real combat experience was necessary.  
While I was lost in thought, the woman continued speaking to Yu-jeong.  
“He said he wanted to eat my breasts.”  
I couldn’t help but think, *She’s as legendary as ever.* Chuckling softly, she finally released Yu-jeong and shot a sultry smile at me and An-hyeon. I wanted to let it play out a bit longer, but I couldn’t ignore Yu-jeong’s desperate glance for help any longer.  
I slowly reached for the water cup on the table. The woman’s eyes sparkled with interest as she watched me. I took a sip, then set the cup down with a slight infusion of mana.  
*Tap.*  
The sound of the cup hitting the wooden table rang out unusually loud. My mana spread outward from the cup, neutralizing hers in an instant. Normally, I’d release a burst to shock an opponent, but this wasn’t a combat situation.  
Like a curtain lifting, the intangible pressure filling the air vanished. An-hyeon and An-sol, practically buried in their chairs, looked between me and the woman in shock.  
Yu-jeong, who’d been the closest and thus most affected, was breathing heavily. Her face showed clear frustration, but she kept her eyes down, likely having instinctively sensed the vast gap in User rank between her and the woman.  
“Oh…?”  
The woman, clearly not expecting this, let out a small gasp and straightened up. Her expression shifted from surprise to curiosity as she looked at me. I spoke calmly.  
“Sounds like that guy deserved to be chased out.”  
She gave me an amused look, then nodded readily.  
“Right? But he was a customer. Business hasn’t been great lately… So I told him one meal would cost a hundred Gold.”  
*I’ve got a thousand Gold.*  
“He didn’t look like he had that kind of money.”  
“Yeah, he said he didn’t have the cash. But he offered something else instead.”  
“Something else?”  
Her smile deepened as she continued, “Yeah. He said he’d give me a bunch of syringes.”  
“Syringes? They have those in the Hall Plane too?”  
An-hyeon, having regained some composure, jumped into the conversation with a noticeably subdued voice. Trying to get a word in with her, huh? Men are such sad creatures.  
The woman gave him a seductive smile, as if finding him adorable, and replied, “Of course. Don’t all men carry a syringe filled with white nutrients?”  
“Huh…?”  
Pointing a slender finger at An-hyeon’s pants, she continued, “You’ve got one too, don’t you? A syringe with white nutrients.”  
“White nutrients? Oh…!”  
Realizing what she meant, An-hyeon’s face flushed as he bowed his head. Only An-sol still looked clueless, unable to follow the conversation.  
“I was going to break that syringe, but… he got lucky and ran off.”  
The woman licked her lips with a regretful expression. An-hyeon, hearing this, audibly gulped and quickly pressed his thighs together.
