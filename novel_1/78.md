# Chapter 77: A Bumper Crop of Mages

There was no need to go into exhaustive detail from the start. I explained concisely, covering all necessary points. I recounted the events slowly, starting from when we entered the dungeon and discovered the first user’s corpse. Jeong Ha-yeon had set her spoon down at some point, focusing intently on my words. It wasn’t easy to show such concentration right after waking from a faint, and I inwardly admired her before continuing.

I described finding the male priest and entering the clearing. Then, I mentioned encountering the spiders and seeing a female user. At the mention of a female user, Jeong Ha-yeon’s eyes lit up, and she asked, “Ji-yeon… Oh, that’s my younger sister.”

“I’m sorry, but…” I began.

“No… surely not…” she murmured.

I phrased that part as delicately as possible. I explained that she was suspended in the air, serving as a host for the spiders’ eggs, but I omitted the details of her being violated by monsters and losing her sanity. Sometimes, ignorance is kinder. After a brief hesitation, I added, “And so, I killed her. I could say it was for survival, but as a human, it was too painful to see her in that state. I thought death would be a mercy.”

After admitting I had killed her, I paused.

A brief silence fell between us. As expected, Jeong Ha-yeon stared at me, her face etched with shock. I didn’t avoid her gaze. If I had no intention of recruiting her, I might have found a way to deceive her. But since I’d marked her as a potential recruit, I wanted to be as transparent as possible—though, of course, I framed it to my advantage.

Admitting I killed Jeong Ji-yeon was a calculated move. It was to impress upon her the inevitability of the situation. If she thought it through, she’d realize I didn’t kill her out of malice but because she was beyond saving, and death was cleaner than letting her suffer further indignity.

After a long moment of locking eyes, Jeong Ha-yeon spoke in a trembling voice. “Was she… truly beyond saving?”

“Honestly, she was in a state where she could barely speak. I can describe it in more detail if you wish, but I wouldn’t recommend it. She looked at me with eyes that seemed to plead for something, and I followed what my heart told me. I can at least say I ended it without pain. I’m sorry.”

Jeong Ha-yeon’s voice broke as she said, “I see… She was always so proud, so full of dignity. To be violated by the monsters she despised… to be pregnant with their eggs… I suppose…” Her voice cracked with a sob, and she began to cry. I closed my eyes. Even so, the image of Jeong Ji-yeon’s eyes staring at me floated in my mind. The quiet inn was filled with the sound of a woman’s muffled sobs.

The truth was, I had simply killed her. But whether those eyes were begging for salvation or death was something only she could have known.

Overwhelmed by emotion, Jeong Ha-yeon’s shoulders shook as tears streamed down her face, but it didn’t last long. She quickly wiped her eyes and steadied her voice. I noted her composure with a spark of admiration. Mages often have strong emotional control, but seeing her suppress her rage and maintain such restraint was impressive. Her heart must have been burning with fury, yet she kept it hidden.

“What happened to that monster? Did you… kill it?” she asked.

“In the end, yes, you could say it was dealt with,” I replied.

“How? Even a group of seasoned users struggled against it.”

“There’s a bit of a complicated story behind that.”

I recounted the tale I’d told the others, slightly embellishing Vivian’s role. I described how our party was on the brink of annihilation, how I fought to the end, and how, just as we were about to be overwhelmed, Vivian regained her true self, restrained the main body, and allowed me to rescue her.

Since the biggest hurdle was cleared, the words flowed easily. Jeong Ha-yeon nodded occasionally, listening intently. When I finished, she gazed at me with hollow eyes. I let out a sigh and concluded, “That’s the story.”

After a moment of reflection, she asked, “So, that human-faced spider turned back into a human and is now here at this inn?”

“She regained her human form and her intellect, and she deeply regrets what she did. She was transformed into a spider by a malicious mage, and her intelligence degraded to match. She couldn’t think like a human anymore. While her actions were partly her own, it’s hard to say they reflected her true human will.”

“I understand,” she said. “You mentioned traveling together for a while. Isn’t that dangerous?”

“If it weren’t for her, I’d surely have died in that place. It may sound absurd, but since she saved my life, I’m willing to give her a chance.”

Jeong Ha-yeon’s expression was complex. Understanding her feelings to some extent, I continued in a gentle tone. “Back then, the spider saw the users as intruders in her home and was enraged when her minions were killed. I know you’re angry, but I’d ask you not to seek revenge against her now that she’s human again. Some in our party don’t have fond feelings for her either, but she’s part of our group for now.”

“I… I don’t know,” she said. “Honestly, right now, I want to take revenge. I can’t fully accept what you’ve said, Kim Su-hyeon. It feels shameless to admit, but humans are selfish creatures. For your sake, and for the kindness you’ve shown us, I want to see her without prejudice, but I can’t yet.”

“That’s your choice,” I replied. “In any case, once the other user wakes up, we’ll return the equipment and items your party had.”

Her eyes widened, and then her expression softened slightly. “Thank you, but that’s not necessary. We failed to conquer the dungeon and were as good as dead. By Hall Plane’s rules, all rewards and items in there rightfully belong to your party. We’re just grateful to be alive.”

“There are Jeong Ji-yeon’s belongings among them. We’re satisfied with the rewards we obtained in the dungeon.”

At that, Jeong Ha-yeon’s face hardened. Then, with a faintly touched expression, she said, “You said you’re a Year 0 user?”

“Yes.”

“It’s been a while since I felt such warmth… like back in my early days. Thank you. I truly appreciate your kindness. When you said you killed Ji-yeon, I felt hatred, but you saved our lives and went this far for us. I don’t know what more I could say. I’m sorry.”

“No need to apologize,” I said. “If there had been a way to save Jeong Ji-yeon, I would have spared no effort. I’m just glad you understand the situation.”

“This is Hall Plane, after all. I won’t forget this kindness.”

Her face was tinged with bitterness, but inside, I was smiling. My plan was working. From her demeanor, she wasn’t one to make empty promises. Jeong Ha-yeon was pragmatic. She might be reeling from her sister’s death now, but in time, she’d acknowledge my words and feel indebted to me.

I still had over 500 gold, a pouch of jewels, a pouch of potions, and a book that could upgrade someone to a Rare Class. Even if I gave up their party’s items, easing Jeong Ha-yeon’s suspicions was a small price to pay.

The first step was complete. How I’d handle these users moving forward would depend on time. For now, building a positive relationship was key.

I urged her to eat again. Jeong Ha-yeon gave a slight nod and picked up her spoon, but her hand trembled visibly.

Later, the others came downstairs one by one, including Vivian. Then, Shin Sang-yong joined us. His kind nature bordered on naivety, evident in his expression. Jeong Ha-yeon and I filled him in on our conversation, and he bowed repeatedly, expressing excessive gratitude. When I mentioned returning their items, he was nearly in tears.

“Tch-tch-thank you! Thank you so much! I’ll never forget this kindness!” he stammered.

When I asked about their plans, Jeong Ha-yeon shook her head. It was understandable—she needed time to think. But her question about whether we’d stay here suggested she might visit again.

As promised, I handed over all their party’s items. As Jeong Ha-yeon stroked Jeong Ji-yeon’s robe, she looked at Vivian and spoke. “If you think about it, the archer who fled first was the root of the problem. There’s no shortage of people to blame. I understand your situation, but I can’t accept it. Call me shameless if you want—humans are selfish. For Kim Su-hyeon’s sake and the kindness shown to us, I want to see you without bias, but I can’t yet.”

Vivian said nothing, but at my glance, she bowed her head in response. With that, Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong left the inn. Shin Sang-yong seemed to have more questions, but he followed Jeong Ha-yeon’s lead, showing he could read the room.

Before leaving, Jeong Ha-yeon bowed politely to us, and I said I hoped to see her again. She nodded slightly in return. I didn’t know when, but once she and Shin Sang-yong sorted out their thoughts, they were likely to seek us out. I only hoped it would be soon.

As they walked away, we sat in silence for a moment. Yu-jeong was the first to speak. “That woman’s really something. If it were me, I’d have swung my dagger without thinking.”

“Hmm. She’s pretty cool,” An-hyeon agreed, nodding.

An-sol kept glancing toward the direction she left, her eyes full of pity. I looked at the inn’s door and said calmly, “Indeed. It’s surprising to meet a user with such self-discipline. If she survives, she might make a name for herself.”

My words were sincere. Despite losing her sister, Jeong Ha-yeon showed near-superhuman restraint. It was a stark contrast to how I’d been when I lost my brother. I might have just forged a connection with someone who could become one of the Ten Strongest.

“Ha. The Ten Strongest isn’t that easy,” I muttered, shaking my head at the thought. Jeong Ha-yeon’s demeanor during our talk had left a deep impression. When Yu-jeong piped up, I pressed her down gently and continued in a calm tone, “It’s nothing. By the way, how’s everyone feeling?”

“No issues here,” An-sol replied. “I was exhausted yesterday, but I’m fine today.”

“My whole body aches,” Yu-jeong groaned.

An-hyeon swung his arms, showing he was fine, while Yu-jeong complained a bit. When I looked at An-sol and Vivian, they both nodded. Noticing faint tear tracks on Vivian’s cheeks, I sighed softly and said, “Rest is over as of yesterday. Starting today, we’ll resume work and training. We’ll leave the city occasionally for practice, but the next expedition will be thoroughly prepared.”

In the past, the group might have grumbled, but this time was different. Their faces were filled with determination. This expedition had shown them their shortcomings, and they likely had a sense of what to improve and how to train.

I planned to organize the items from this expedition and buy new equipment for the group. With Vivian’s addition, I also wanted them to practice coordinated formations. Most importantly, just as we’d found the Ancient Alchemist Vivian’s dungeon, we needed to search records to locate the Ruined Laboratory.

For now, I’d let the group train while I handled other tasks in Mul. To find our next destination, the Ruined Laboratory, I’d need to get moving again.
