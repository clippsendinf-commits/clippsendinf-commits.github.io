Soon, Imprison began to emerge above the magic circle. Its appearance was far from impressive. While the spirits summoned by spirit summoners in the past often included some striking ones, the magical beasts Vivian summoned were, frankly, quite grotesque. Of course, their performance was undeniable, but as the saying goes, if the price is the same, one prefers a red skirt.

Its emaciated body was tightly wrapped in what appeared to be iron chains, and a single eyeball rolled around on its forehead. The triangular shape of its head somehow evoked a sense of repulsion. Still, since it was an ally, I decided to observe it calmly.

Vivian looked at her summoned beast, Imprison, with proud eyes and immediately issued a command.

“Imprison? Restrain both arms of that guy up ahead. Show everyone here the full majesty of the 49th Legion’s ruler.”

“━━━━.”

Imprison’s mouth opened slightly, letting out incomprehensible words. It was presumed to be expressing obedience to Vivian’s command. Though Imprison, ruler of the 49th Legion, was slightly inferior to Queritatus of the 14th Legion summoned earlier, it demonstrated its abilities without reservation.

*Clank! Clank!*

The iron chains wrapped around Imprison’s body began to unravel. Soon, those chains, emanating an unknown energy, surged fiercely toward the giant. The giant crouched upon seeing the approaching chains, but in such a confined space, with its massive frame, dodging the determined chains was a futile effort.

Seizing the opportunity, I turned to An-hyeon and spoke.

“An-hyeon.”

“Yes!”

His response was sharp, filled with discipline. Noticing his expression, I gave a faint smile. He seemed anxious, perhaps worried that I was disappointed by his earlier failed attack. Seeing a hint of smugness on Yu-jeong’s face from her vantage point as a lookout in the distance only confirmed my suspicions. I continued in a calm tone.

“Once Vivian’s Imprison finishes restraining it, I’ll move forward to completely block its movements. You take that chance to strike from the side or behind with your spear—deeply. No need for multiple stabs. One will do. Got it?”

“This time, I’ll definitely meet your expectations.”

After confirming that An-hyeon was clenching his teeth and channeling mana into the tip of his spear, I turned my gaze back. By now, Imprison’s chains were wrapping tightly around the giant’s arms.

“Grraaah! Grraaaah!”

The giant struggled to resist, but with its right hand already injured, it had no chance of breaking free from the chains with its remaining hand. Seeing the chains completely encircling both arms, it let out a mournful cry. The moment Vivian gave the signal, I leaped forward with all my strength.

Going low risked getting kicked. A wounded beast’s actions are unpredictable, so caution was warranted. As I soared into the air, I drew my sword back as far as I could. As I descended and the giant’s body came closer…

Its arms were forcibly pulled back, exposing its chest toward me—an act of Vivian’s making. I was ready to repay her support fully.

*Thud.*

I thrust my arm forward, driving the sword into the center of its chest. The giant’s skin was tough, but it was no match for the authority of a Sword Specialist like me. Feeling the blade sink deep, I used the momentum of my descent to slash downward forcefully. The sensation of cutting through rotten wood traveled through the blade to my hand.

“Kraaaaargh!”

“An-hyeon! Finish it!”

“Hah!”

By now, An-hyeon had circled behind, poised for a fatal strike with his spear drawn back. At my shout, he thrust it toward the wailing giant’s neck. The mana-infused spear tore through the air with a piercing sound that echoed through the room.

“Kuh! Kuuuh! Kuuuuuh!”

Perhaps resentful of falling so vainly after being trapped for so long, the giant shed tears of blood. It must have been bitterly frustrated. But that wasn’t my concern, and An-hyeon’s spear showed no mercy. The spearhead flew cleanly, striking the giant’s nape with force.

*Thud! Crack!*

A shattering sound. The giant’s neck wasn’t just pierced—it was obliterated. Spewing blood and foam from its mouth, the giant scanned its surroundings with resentful eyes before slowly collapsing. It was truly the giant’s end.

“Huhu. Well done, Imprison. You can return now.”

Vivian, with an excited expression, unsummoned Imprison and flashed me a cryptic smile. I gently patted her head. No matter what anyone said, Vivian was the MVP of this battle. Without her restraining its arms, An-hyeon wouldn’t have been able to approach from behind. At my touch, Vivian twisted her body and gave a smug smile.

Still, An-hyeon’s final strike was impressive, so I didn’t forget to praise him.

“An-hyeon, that last strike was good. Well done.”

“Phew… My heart’s still racing. Thank you.”

An-hyeon let out a heavy sigh at my praise and finally smiled. Shin Sang-yong and Jeong Ha-yeon, who hadn’t contributed much to this fight, looked apologetic. Sol was relieved that no one was hurt, and Yu-jeong was grumbling while glancing at An-hyeon, but I ignored her. I’d give her a chance next time.

Since I planned to explore the entire first floor by the end of the day, we needed to move quickly. Just in case, I thoroughly searched the room, but this time, we found nothing. Leaving the giant’s cooling corpse behind, we exited the room.

“Ugh. It’s so big but totally useless. What kind of lab is this?!”

Yu-jeong’s grumbling reached my ears, and An-sol frowned slightly, but I was inwardly pleased. Her words were proof she was starting to grasp the harsh reality of the Hall Plane. If they were still spouting nonsense about the sanctity of life or not killing recklessly, I might have abandoned them. But the kids were gradually changing. They were reaching the point where they wouldn’t even flinch at death before their eyes.

“Well… after all the effort we’ve put in, it’d be troublesome if we didn’t get at least this much.”

Muttering to myself, I moved to the front of the group. An-hyeon’s breathing was still rough, likely from the lingering intensity of the battle.

“Then, let’s proceed again.”

Speaking softly to the group, I stepped into the shadowy corridor where the light flickered. Five rooms remained to be explored.

*

“Ha. Five duds in a row. This is so depressing.”

“Cheer up. We did get *something*, even if it’s less than 10 gold…”

Yu-jeong’s complaints were met with Jeong Ha-yeon’s soothing voice from behind. But her bitter tone suggested she was just as disheartened. I understood their feelings, so I kept walking silently forward.

Explorations can be fun when you find piles of gold or rare magical gear—those moments fuel excitement. You naturally start wondering, “What’s next?” But our current situation was the opposite. Each fight drained us, and we had nothing to show for it. Sure, we’d earned some rewards—scraping every room we passed yielded a small amount of gold. But compared to the battles we’d fought, it was pitiful.

To be more specific, including the giant’s room, we’d opened five rooms, but the results were dismal. Four of those rooms had monsters, and none were pushovers.

The first room had the giant, the second had wraiths, the third had a mud golem, the fourth was empty, and the fifth had more wraiths. We fought battle after battle, and all we got was less than 10 gold. With me and Vivian around, the fights weren’t life-threatening, but the exhaustion was unavoidable.

Now, we stood before the sixth and final room in the western direction. Unlike the previous rooms’ iron doors, this one was made of wood. That wasn’t the only difference. The other doors had exuded a chilling aura or faint presence, but this one felt utterly ordinary.

“It feels like a storage closet for cleaning supplies…”

An-hyeon tilted his head and spoke, his voice tinged with frustration. Adding to it, Vivian chimed in sharply.

“Tch. It’s obviously just a storeroom. Su-hyeon, let’s open it quick and move on.”

I glanced at the group. Fatigue was creeping onto their faces. The repeated battles were wearing them down. I looked at Sol, who was quietly watching me, and hardened my expression. I planned to rest after this room, but we still had to stay sharp.

“Everyone, focus. We’re at the door. Get into position… What are you all doing?”

At my sharp rebuke, An-hyeon and Vivian, who had been grumbling, flinched and stepped back. Honestly, even if the rewards were poor, they were standing right in front of a door. What if they opened it carelessly and something rushed out?

Sensing my mood, the group raised their weapons and took defensive stances. I sighed and kicked the wooden door open. Unlike the iron doors, it swung open easily.

Fortunately, unlike the giant in the first room, no attack came the moment we opened it. I sensed the interior briefly, and detecting no response, I spoke softly.

“Hm. Nothing’s coming out. But it’s too dark.”

“—Light!”

Jeong Ha-yeon immediately cast a light spell. A glowing orb formed and floated into the room. I leaned in to examine the interior more closely.

“Hm…?”

As the orb illuminated the room, I let out a sound of surprise. I sheathed the sword I’d half-drawn. Stepping inside, I stopped after a few paces, struck by what I saw. The others hurried in behind me.

“Wow…!”

“Wooow.”

“Oh! This is incredible!”

The group’s exclamations rang out in unison. Following me, they stood beside me, captivated by the sight.

The room was indeed a storeroom, about 20 pyeong in size, with no furniture. What was astonishing, however, were the weapons scattered across the floor. Not only that, but glints of gold and gems were visible among them. Seeing the group’s faces light up, I spoke in a calm tone.

“It looks like this was a storage for weapons, likely for emergencies.”

“Indeed. But aren’t these ancient weapons? If they’re truly from that era…”

Jeong Ha-yeon, unable to hide her excitement, wore a thrilled smile. Ancient weapons from a prosperous era weren’t just mana-efficient—they could directly boost stats. Such gear was rare but did exist.

“Oppa…”

Yu-jeong called out to me in a pleading tone. Turning, I saw her fidgeting, clearly eager. I nodded to meet her expectations.

“Let’s gather anything useful. Just in case, one person should keep watch outside.”

“Ugh…”

At my words, the group exchanged glances, sizing each other up. So, no one wanted to miss out on this. Realizing their thoughts, I gave a wry smile. I was about to head to the door myself when—

“Oh, I’ll do it. Leader, you stay.”

Turning at Shin Sang-yong’s voice, I saw him raising his hand with a bright smile.

“It’s fine. I see some magic-user gear too.”

“No, really. I can’t claim the spoils from this exploration anyway, so I’m good. I’ll keep watch.”

Before I could stop him, Shin Sang-yong moved toward the door. I could guess his intentions. He seemed to like the group’s dynamic and didn’t want to cause friction over loot, so he volunteered to step aside.

Of course, he probably wanted to join in too. Yet, with a cheerful expression, he willingly took the role of lookout. Watching him diligently guard the door, I paused in thought. If he kept this up, it’d only be human to want to reward him somehow.

After a moment of watching him, I turned my gaze back to the floor. The rest of the group, minus Shin Sang-yong, was already engrossed in treasure hunting.
