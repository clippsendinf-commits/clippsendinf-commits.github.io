# Memorize - Chapter 85: Sweeping a Thousand Miles in One Go

The sword, swung with enough force to split the earth, sliced past Jeong Ha-yeon’s side and plunged deep into the ground. After driving the blade into the earth, I poured mana into it. With a resounding “Boom!” the surrounding ground heaved upward, and faint cracks spread out.

Jeong Ha-yeon, who had been staring at me with eyes wide like a startled rabbit, soon let out a sigh of relief as she noticed the blood seeping up from the ground.

“Phew. Thank you.”

“Don’t mention it.”

I twisted the sword once and pulled it out, giving it a light shake. With a sharp *swish*, the blood clinging to the blade splattered onto the ground. Shin Sang-yong, who had initially looked shocked when I charged in with my sword, now wore an awkward smile as he watched Jeong Ha-yeon calmly converse with me.

An-hyeon and Yu-jeong were running around enthusiastically, competing to see who could take down more enemies. Honestly, the foes left standing were barely worth calling a fight—they were just there for the finishing blow. It was practically a formality.

“I got twelve!”

“I got fourteen! Ha, I win!”

“Tch.”

Seeing An-hyeon raise both hands in triumph and Yu-jeong pout, my party and I couldn’t help but laugh.

This was what a proper battle fought by true Users looked like. Of course, it wasn’t exactly ordinary. At least in my eyes, Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong showed a level of coordination that came from extensive experience, delivering a high-caliber performance.

The kids, who had always fought in a rough-and-tumble way, seemed to find this style of combat unfamiliar. They gazed at the pair with awe, clearly impressed. At the same time, I could see a flicker of frustration in An-hyeon’s eyes. I had a good guess why, so I patted his shoulder a couple of times to reassure him.

The Wasteland was a paradise for Landmoles. It was so harsh that not only Users but even most monsters refused to live here, choosing to leave instead. Only the Landmoles, burrowing underground, thrived in this desolate place. In that sense, the Wasteland could truly be called their heaven.

The highlight of our battles was undoubtedly the clash with a hundred Landmoles. After two days of slaughtering them, the creatures seemed to have had enough and banded together to ambush us—right in the middle of our encampment, no less.

But no User worth their salt would fail to notice such a large force moving in. I always kept my detection active, so I was ready. Since it was dark and they were coming from all directions, even Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong looked uneasy. They could handle it if they wanted to, but the limited visibility made them cautious.

That’s when my kids—my *party*—stepped up. They’d been trained to wake and fight even in the middle of sleep, and they responded with agility that belied their zero-year User status. In no time, they formed a defensive formation, coordinating seamlessly to protect the mages and priests. It was their best performance yet, likely spurred by a sense of inferiority after witnessing Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong’s skills earlier that day.

Of course, with Vivian’s chimeric beasts guarding the rear and me holding the front, An-hyeon and Yu-jeong’s defensive range was narrower, but it was still an impressive feat. Their success allowed the mages and priests to cast their spells with greater ease.

“That was incredible. Are they really zero-year Users?”

That was the first thing Jeong Ha-yeon asked after the battle ended. She didn’t know yet, but the kids could hardly be called zero-year Users anymore. Between their stats, experience, and the title of having successfully completed an expedition, they were on par with mid-tier Users.

“Impressive. Forming and maintaining a formation like that isn’t easy…”

They also earned high praise for quickly setting up the formation and maintaining efficient coordination. Jeong Ha-yeon’s compliments seemed to inflate the kids’ egos a bit. An-hyeon’s fake cough was particularly amusing.

Still, it was a pretty good moment—until Yu-jeong, true to form, had to chime in like the proverbial fly in the ointment.

“Unni, our *Dad* taught us.”

“Huh? Dad?”

Yu-jeong glanced at me before turning away. Jeong Ha-yeon looked at me with a calm expression, then let out an inexplicable sigh and shook her head. There was something oddly unsettling about the pitying look she gave me afterward.

“Why are you looking at me like that?”

“…You’ve been speeding, haven’t you?”

“…”

“Hoho, just kidding.”

With the ground littered with corpses, it didn’t feel right to keep sleeping there, so we moved to a new spot to catch up on rest. The kids whined about not being able to sleep, but I insisted they rest for the sake of tomorrow’s activities.

After I reluctantly gave in and “sang a lullaby” for Yu-jeong—by which I mean I smacked her head once—she wailed dramatically. Ignoring her, I settled down to sleep. As expected, her crying stopped abruptly, followed by a petulant “Tch.”

The next day—our third day—we arrived at the location I’d marked. As expected, the Ruined Laboratory was nowhere in sight. I activated my Third Eye to check for a barrier, but there was none this time. That meant it was still hidden somewhere beyond my detection range.

Deciding to press forward, I was mulling over which of the branching paths to take when Yu-jeong’s voice broke my thoughts.

“Sol, where are you going?”

Looking up, I saw An-sol, with her backpack already on, wandering toward one of the paths. She stopped, her face blank, then turned with a more alert expression.

“Huh?”

“Huh? What’s with the ‘huh’? Where do you think you’re going?”

“Ow, ouch! That hurts!”

“You’ll get lost if you wander off on your own like that!”

“It’s not that…”

Rubbing her stretched cheeks after Yu-jeong grabbed her, An-sol pouted and explained. Her reasoning was simple: she just had a feeling this path was the right one and started walking without thinking.

Most of the party chuckled at her explanation, but An-hyeon and I didn’t. He turned to me with burning eyes.

“Hyung.”

“Yeah.”

On the surface, I agreed that this path seemed like the right choice and led the party down An-sol’s chosen route, but I had another reason. Luck was a stat, after all. The information I had only got us this far. Trusting An-sol’s 100-point Luck stat might be better than picking a path at random. At the very least, I hoped it would lead us closer to our goal.

Battles were frequent along the way, but no one was particularly worn out. Supplies were plentiful, and we’d taken enough breaks. More importantly, after the fight with the hundred Landmoles, the kids’ skills seemed to have leveled up. Their movements were noticeably sharper.

We were starting to leave the Wasteland behind, entering greener terrain. But this wasn’t necessarily good news. The Wasteland only had Landmoles to deal with, but from here on, other monsters could appear.

This area was essentially uncharted territory. On a map, true uncharted regions were marked much farther north, but even this place had traces of other Users passing through. However, there were often signs of people entering without ever coming out. Since Mul had only been established for less than two months, this area was still considered part of the uncharted frontier.

An-sol was now at the front of the group with me. I couldn’t shake a slight unease, but she was unusually cheerful for an expedition, grinning the whole way. At every fork, I let her lead, and she’d point to one path without hesitation.

Shin Sang-yong seemed indifferent, while Jeong Ha-yeon looked skeptical. But after I vouched for An-sol’s instincts—backed by the fact that she’d saved the party before—they started looking at her with newfound curiosity. In uncharted territory, as long as we didn’t get completely lost, any path was as good as another.

Honestly, I hadn’t planned to use An-sol this way, but if we found the Ruined Laboratory, it’d give me a convenient excuse. I could say it was all her doing, not mine. I couldn’t mention her Luck stat, but I could chalk it up to beginner’s luck—a perfect cover.

As the sun began to set, we spotted the entrance to a forest. Calling it a forest felt generous; ever since we left the Wasteland, everything around us had been lush green. It was a pristine, untouched natural landscape, unlike anything in the modern world.

But something felt off about the entrance. There were other paths, but An-sol kept insisting on going inside. Deciding it was time to check, I activated my Third Eye.

In that moment, I understood the source of my unease. This forest entrance wasn’t natural—it was artificially made. With a surge of excitement, I stepped inside.

Soon, a clear path emerged. Unlike the rough terrain we’d traversed, this one bore faint signs of human touch. Along the way, we encountered a pack of Mangis, but after hunting them relentlessly during the Rite of Passage, they were no challenge. The kids, thrilled to see Mangis after so long, dispatched them in no time.

Before, we’d marched at a steady pace, but now I quickened our steps. As An-sol ran beside me, clutching my hand and panting, I came to a stop.

I gazed ahead with calm eyes. There, standing tall, was the Ruined Laboratory that Users had long sought. Parts of it were worn and rusted, overgrown with vines, but despite the passage of time, the building still held its shape.

They say the darkest place is under the lamp. The Ruined Laboratory was just a three-day journey from the small city of Mul. It was baffling that it hadn’t been found sooner. But recalling the feeling at the entrance, I nodded to myself.

People probably dismissed it as just a forest entrance, assuming the laboratory couldn’t be here. Without An-sol’s insistence or my sense of unease, we might have passed it by. Building something like this inside a forest—those ancient inhabitants were something else.

“We’ve found the Ruined Laboratory,” I said quietly to the group.

The party stared at the imposing structure before them, speechless. Shin Sang-yong and Jeong Ha-yeon stood with their mouths agape, struggling to process the reality of the situation.

“No way… Even if it’s beginner’s luck, this is…”

“Ha. This is… a bit surprising.”

Jeong Ha-yeon, finally snapping out of it, turned her stunned gaze to An-sol, who stood there blankly. I gave a small smile, walked over to An-sol, and placed my hands on her waist.

“Our Sol is such a lucky charm.”

Even as I touched her, An-sol showed no resistance. She just tilted her head, looking at me with innocent eyes.

“I’m a lucky charm?”

“You bet. You’re the best, Sol.”

Realizing I was praising her, her face broke into a wide, beaming smile. I lifted her up, bouncing her a few times like an airplane. 

“Waa! Waa!”

An-sol squealed with delight, raising both arms in a reserved cheer. I set her down gently and turned back to the group. Three days after leaving Mul, we had found the Ruined Laboratory.
