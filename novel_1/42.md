# Chapter 41: Make an Offer

As the training progressed into weeks 9, 10, and 11, the users seemed to be settling into a rhythm. Users who could barely manage a long run in week 1 were now breezing through twenty laps with smiles on their faces. Watching them complete every training session without a single dropout, I allowed myself a satisfied smile.

The remaining group numbered just over eighty—a rare feat for the User Academy, where graduating with more than eighty users was almost unheard of. As the final week 13, graduation season, approached, a strange tension began to ripple through the academy.

The first noticeable change was in the instructors’ attitudes toward the new users. Not all instructors were from the Golden Lion Clan; about seventy percent were from major city clans, while the remaining thirty percent were handpicked users from regular or smaller cities, sent on assignment. The instructors, who had been barking orders like drill sergeants in the early weeks, were gradually softening, becoming almost friendly. It wasn’t uncommon to see them discreetly pulling one or two users aside for a nice meal, and some even made recruitment offers right on the spot after training. Of course, these offers were reserved for users who showed some degree of skill.

The new living instructors were another spectacle. They assigned beautiful female instructors to the male users’ dorms and charming male instructors to the female users’ dorms. Anyone with a brain could see the intent behind these personnel changes.

With training wrapping up earlier each day, our group had more time to spend together. Lately, An-hyeon, An-sol, and Yu-jeong kept asking me about my plans for the future, their eyes fixed on me as if I held all the answers.

“Hyung, what are you going to do?”  
“Oppa, what about you? You must’ve gotten a ton of offers. Got any plans to join a clan?”  
“…”

I appreciated their trust, but this blind reliance wasn’t healthy. They needed to start thinking for themselves instead of just following me. When I pointed this out as gently as possible, Yu-jeong pouted but shot back,  
“Who said I’m not thinking? I just wanted to hear your thoughts first!”  
“What if my plans are different from yours?”  
“Then I’ll follow you, obviously!”  
“Yeah, yeah! I trust Hyung. Fighting, Hyung!”  

An-hyeon chimed in, nodding enthusiastically. Lately, they seemed to treat me like some kind of miracle worker. When I asked why, An-sol grinned and said, “If I just listen to Su-hyeon oppa, good things happen even in my sleep!”  

I gave a wry smile and shook my head. My efforts during the Rite of Passage and my growing reputation at the academy must’ve created some kind of synergy for them. Part of me was grateful for their trust, but I held back from saying too much. I’d speak up before graduation, but the time wasn’t right yet.

Kim Han-byeol had been keeping her distance lately. I heard she and Yu-jeong barely acknowledged each other anymore, even when they crossed paths. Given Han-byeol’s potential to rank among the top female users, it was no surprise that clans were salivating over her.

While promising users like her were busy weighing offers with a sense of pride, others who hadn’t received any were growing anxious as graduation loomed. There were surely clans in smaller or mid-sized cities they could join, but some still clung to the dream of a major clan. Rumors circulated about some female users taking bold measures—befriending instructors and even using their bodies to gain favor. It showed just how fierce the competition was.

Seeing my group start to slack off, I nagged them to focus on training since we were still in the academy. The three-month User Academy wasn’t arbitrary; it was a golden window—roughly 90 to 100 days—when users could boost their stats the fastest. They grumbled, but when I told them they’d regret not pushing now later, they shut up fast. To set an example, I threw myself into training even harder. Back when I was striving to become a Sword Master, I never skipped a single day of practice.

And so, time marched on, with graduation season drawing ever closer.

---

By week 13, with only one day left until graduation, the users were winding down their academy life. The instructors, strict during training, were much more lenient outside of it. Users spent their free time on personal maintenance or gathering in small groups to chat.

The final day passed quickly, and night fell. Since it was our last night, the users in my dorm held a simple gathering. The instructors turned a blind eye as long as we didn’t go overboard, and it wasn’t just our dorm—others were doing the same.  

It wasn’t a grand affair, just dried meat from our supplies and some drinks. Still, the sight of alcohol sent the users into a frenzy, laughing and drinking noisily. An-hyeon and I exchanged a quick nod and slipped out of our seats. At Yu-jeong’s suggestion, we’d planned a private celebration with our group, sneaking out of the dorm.  

We managed to slip out quietly—everyone was too drunk and rowdy, shouting “We did it!” while arm-in-arm, to notice us leaving. It was easier than expected.  

As I reached for my pocket out of habit, I realized I’d forgotten my cigarettes. I told An-hyeon to head to our meeting spot first and turned back to the dorm. He shrugged, saying, “What’s the big deal about skipping a smoke?” But as a smoker, I couldn’t drink without a cigarette—it was a ritual.  

After grabbing my cigarettes and heading back out, I made my way to the meeting spot: a quiet corner of the Academic Information Hall. It was a bold move, but at this hour, we’d likely get away with it even if caught.  

The deep night sky cast a dim veil over the grounds. I hurried across the empty training field toward the building, but as I passed the restroom…  

“Ah… ugh… mmh…”  

A strange, heated moan drifted from inside. My sharp hearing caught it clearly. Curiosity piqued, I cautiously pushed open the tightly shut restroom door. Despite my care, the hinges creaked loudly. But before I could worry about the noise, a wave of sultry heat hit me from within.  

“Ohhh… ah… ngh!”  

What a mess. Clothes were strewn everywhere, and a user wearing an instructor’s cap loomed over a woman who was moaning beneath him. Her jet-black cropped hair fanned out on the floor, and her slender legs, spread wide, flailed in the air. That face… I’d seen her once or twice before.  

The man on top was definitely an instructor. Each time he thrust forcefully, the woman’s body jolted like a fish out of water, her moans unrestrained.  

“Quiet… down! Your moans… are too… loud!”  
“It’s because… you’re too intense… ugh… ah…!”  

His hips moved rhythmically with each word. The instructor, perhaps tiring, slowed to a deep stir before pausing, still inside her. The woman’s body writhed as she clung to him tightly.  

For a moment, they savored the afterglow. Then, her lips parted, her face flushed with ecstasy.  

“You promised, right? You’ll get me into your clan…”  
“Don’t worry. Wait for me after the discharge ceremony tomorrow. I’ll take you.”  

They resumed moving, the air filling with her lascivious cries. From their conversation, I pieced together the situation. I quietly closed the door. Unlike the Western Continent, where coercion was common, this wasn’t forced—at least not technically. Even in the strict Northern Continent, some new female users willingly used their bodies as leverage. There was no stopping it entirely.  

I turned to head to the Information Hall, but—  

“*Gasp*.”  

I let out a startled sound. Kim Han-byeol was standing right behind me, staring. I hadn’t sensed her approach, even though I’d let my guard down. I must’ve been too engrossed in the scene. Quickly composing myself, I spoke calmly.  

“You startled me. How long have you been there?”  

“I went to your dorm to talk, but you weren’t there. I saw you go back in and come out, so I followed you.”  

“So you saw… inside the restroom?”  

I didn’t finish the question, but she seemed to understand. Her slight blush and averted gaze suggested she’d seen it all from the start. Feeling a bit exposed but knowing I’d done nothing wrong, I decided to own it. For their sake, it was best to leave.  

I walked quietly toward the Information Hall, and she followed, matching my pace. Under the cool moonlight, we walked side by side in silence, the earlier awkwardness lingering. She spoke first.  

“That woman in there… I think it’s Lee Ji-yeong.”  

“Lee Ji-yeong… I’ve seen her a couple of times.”  

“You don’t know her?”  

Her question made me tilt my head. Why would I? She wasn’t particularly skilled, and we’d never spoken. Sure, she was decently pretty, but compared to Yu-jeong, Sol, or Han-byeol, she was average. I answered matter-of-factly.  

“Nope. Never talked to her. Why would I know her?”  

Relief flickered across Han-byeol’s face. It made me curious about this Lee Ji-yeong. Why was Han-byeol reacting like this just because I didn’t know her? Before I could dwell on it, she continued.  

“It’s better you don’t. She doesn’t have the best reputation among us. There were rumors about… what you just saw. I didn’t expect to see it myself, though. Why were you there?”  

“We’re having a graduation celebration at the Information Hall. I heard weird noises from the restroom and checked. Anyway, since we’re here, want to come?”  

I wanted to say, “You’re coming, right?” but our recent distance made me hesitate. She lowered her head, staring at the ground. Her ears, peeking through her dark hair, looked oddly cute. As I shook off the stray thought, her lips began to move.  

“I… want to talk for a bit.”  

Oh, right—she’d mentioned she had something to say. I nodded readily. It had been a while since we’d talked one-on-one.  

“The Golden Lion Clan made me an offer.”  

“…Yeah?”  

“They don’t usually take new users right away, but this time they’re expanding. They said they could help me grow, especially as a mage. And… they’d recommend me as an executive candidate if I join.”  

I let out a sharp breath. I’d expected a direct pitch, but her words caught me off guard. Helping a mage grow? That was vague. And an executive recommendation for a new user? That was unheard of. Unless she had a Secret or Rare class…  

A sudden realization hit me, and I stopped dead in my tracks. Han-byeol looked at me curiously, but I ignored her and activated my Third Eye.

“Oppa…?”  

Her voice snapped me out of my daze. I nodded absently, my mind racing with questions—why, how, when? I forced myself to focus.  

A Jewel Mage would indeed need clan support early on. The gems used as magical catalysts were insanely expensive. But that wasn’t the point. Han-byeol hadn’t told me she’d gotten a Secret class. Yet, the Golden Lion Clan offering her an executive role suggested she’d revealed it to them.  

A pang of betrayal surged through me, but I quickly pushed it down. I’d decided to treat her as a friend and let her go if needed. Still, the sudden emotion showed I wasn’t as detached as I thought.  

If I’d known she had a Secret class like Jewel Mage, I might’ve acted differently. But rationalizing now felt wrong—it was the kind of self-justification I despised.  

Shutting out my emotions, I steeled myself with cold logic. From now on, I’d treat her as just another user, not a sisterly figure.  

“I heard the Golden Lion Clan made you an offer too,” she said, her face still calm.  

I matched her tone. “I told them I’d think about it.”  

“Have you decided?”  

“Yeah. I’m turning them down. I don’t plan to join any clan.”  

“…Why?”  

Her body flinched at my words.  

I paused, then started walking again. She followed, and we locked eyes, a complex mix of unspoken emotions passing between us.
