# Chapter 113: A Dark Past

“Maybe your sister…”

“No.”

Jeong Ha-yeon dismissed my assumption with a single word. The situation was already dramatic enough, but if that female user had been Jeong Ji-yeon, it would have crossed a line into absurdity. Fortunately, Jeong Ha-yeon firmly denied it with her resolute response.

“Of course, that girl’s usual behavior wasn’t exactly commendable, but she’s still my precious little sister. Anyway… the female user was a mage who arrived a few months before us. I won’t reveal her name. But she was exceptionally talented, enough to be undergoing executive training at the time. When our eyes met, she seemed startled at first, but then she smiled at me, frozen as I was. And then she spoke to the man she was entangled with.”

Could it be… Yu-bin? Seong Yu-bin? I tilted my head. She was currently following Park Hyeon-woo around. But several details didn’t add up to suggest that man was Park Hyeon-woo. For a moment, many thoughts swirled in my mind, but I decided to focus on her story.

“I still vividly remember the conversation they had. I’ll recount it exactly as it happened. It started with the woman. *‘You’ve got that girl following you around, don’t you?’* *‘Huh? Oh, her.’* *‘Why bring her up all of a sudden?’* *‘No reason… She just seems special to you.’* *‘Special? Nah, I don’t think so.’* *‘She seems to really like you. Is it okay to do this with me?’* *‘Oh, it’s fine. Honestly, she’s pretty enough, but she’s not my type. I prefer passionate women like you.’*

Jeong Ha-yeon recited the dialogue from that day with precision. It had been at least a year, yet she remembered it so clearly—it must have been a profound shock. As I listened, my expression turned incredulous, and she gave a bittersweet smile before continuing.

“The woman laughed gleefully, clearly pleased by his words. *‘Really? Still, I feel bad for her.’* *‘It’s fine. She’s a bit of a pity, but… I only brought her along for leverage.’* *‘Leverage?’* *‘Yeah. There’s a rumor that the Golden Lion Clan’s scout has a thing for killing new users—especially smart, pretty, young girls. Ha-yeon’s got decent skills and a nice face, so I thought she’d be perfect for him. That way, he’d look out for me. But that girl messed it all up. Damn it. Ow! Easy, that hurts.’* *‘Sorry. Thinking about her just pisses me off.’* *‘Anyway, she’ll throw herself at the scout soon enough, so let’s not worry about it. It’s annoying…’*

Listening to their conversation, I felt a chill run down my spine at the thought of Jeong Ha-yeon. The depth of composure I’d sensed when I first met her wasn’t a lie. As a man, I couldn’t fully grasp her pain, but I couldn’t even imagine how heart-wrenching it must have been from a woman’s perspective. What was even more unsettling was that she didn’t shed a single tear while recounting it. Hearing her story, I couldn’t hold back a deep sigh.

“That’s right. To him, I was just a tool for his advancement. I ended up in this hellish Hall Plane, but I thought as long as I was with him, I could endure anything. But that was just my delusion. From start to finish, he only thought of himself and used me.”

“What happened after that?”

“I went straight to the person in charge of personnel. I woke them up in the middle of the night and told them I was quitting. And the most shocking part? He didn’t say a word against it—he just approved it. Isn’t that ridiculous?”

Of course. Keeping her would have been risky, but there was no justification to kick her out. A clan with nothing to lose wouldn’t stop someone who wanted to leave. Having finished her story, she let out a heavy breath and leaned back in her chair. Out of habit, I pulled a cigarette from my pocket. As I placed it in my mouth, a faint flame sparked at the tip.

For a while, neither Jeong Ha-yeon nor I spoke. An awkward silence hung between us, with only the table separating us. After enough time passed to finish the cigarette, I flicked the ash, and Jeong Ha-yeon, who had been watching me quietly, spoke in a relieved tone.

“Thank you. You listened to my boring, unpleasant story for a long time.”

“Don’t mention it. I understand you.”

“I don’t like empty words. What exactly do you understand?”

“The struggle of standing up to the most powerful clan and individuals, especially as a woman in a disadvantaged position. The process of enduring for so long as the underdog. The unfair treatment you must have felt from the clan. The rage that finally burst out after the actions of the man you thought was your last hope. I understand your position, empathize with it, and sympathize.”

At my point-by-point explanation, she gave a sad smile and immediately responded.

“Yes. So, I suppose it’s finally time to get to the point.”

Watching her clasp her hands and continue, I shook my head. Her eyes widened at my reaction.

“It’s too late at night. You’ve said a lot already. Let’s call it—”

“The night is deep, and we have plenty of time.”

“Let’s continue next time—”

“No. I want to settle this tonight.”

Jeong Ha-yeon stared at me with eyes that seemed to flicker with a bluish flame. Before I realized it, she had grabbed my hand as I tried to rise from the table. Her hand on mine was cold yet refreshing. Sensing her unwavering resolve, I spoke calmly.

“What more do you want to say?”

“The story you mentioned—about paying a price to settle a debt.”

I looked at her silently. I understood her circumstances, but this was a separate matter. If she was trying to appeal to my emotions, she was barking up the wrong tree. But her eyes didn’t carry that kind of intent.

I adjusted my posture. This was the start of the second battle since the Ruined Laboratory, but this time, I was the one in control.

“So, how do you plan to pay that price, that debt?”

I responded to her quietly, and she shrugged slightly, shaking her head gently.

“I’m sorry for cornering you with the *Crystal of Truth*. But after that day, I developed a habit of distrusting others, especially men. I had to be sure.”

“I can understand doing it without reason. But that doesn’t justify your actions, User Jeong Ha-yeon. Please separate personal and professional matters.”

“I know. But I just don’t understand. What exactly do you want from me, User Kim Su-hyeon?”

“That’s for you to figure out. It’s not my place to decide.”

I didn’t budge an inch. I sympathized with her, but I couldn’t let it slide. Some might call me too harsh, but this was the Hall Plane. By revealing information tied to my survival, I had at least enough justification to kill her—and she knew it.

At my firm tone, she spoke in a weary voice.

“On the way back from the Ruined Laboratory, I thought a lot. But… in the end, I concluded I have nothing to offer.”

“Explain.”

“Are you pretending not to understand, or do you really not get it? What could I possibly give you right now?”

“…”

“User information? Gold? Abilities? Free service? Should I sign a slave contract? I don’t know what you want. No, I genuinely have nothing to offer.”

Her words made me let out a low hum. I tapped the table out of habit. And then it hit me—she appealed to me. I finally understood why I felt drawn to her. She knew her limits. She didn’t cross boundaries. In other words, she knew her place.

True, she had crossed that line once in the laboratory, but that action was proof she had a purpose she wanted to confirm, even at the cost of overstepping. Now it was time to draw that out.

“Some of the things you just listed seem a bit exaggerated.”

“Hah. Exaggerated? My user information isn’t as valuable as yours. I don’t have any gold. Abilities? Sure, I’m skilled, but not as much as you. Free service is the same. A slave contract? Those have too many restrictions between users. Let’s be clear. Even if I joined your party, it wouldn’t be enough to pay the debt. To you, I’m someone who’s nice to have but not essential.”

“Why do you belittle yourself like that?”

“Because it’s the truth. And…”

Jeong Ha-yeon, who had been speaking rapidly, paused to catch her breath. Our eyes met in the air. With a melancholic expression, she exhaled and continued.

“…because I need you.”

Seeing her finally reveal a glimpse of her inner self, I spoke with a hint of regret.

“The price doesn’t have to be something like that. What I wanted was your genuine trust and faith.”

“You’re determined to make me out to be a shameless woman. I still can’t forget that moment. When you said you’d protect those dear to you, and the *Crystal of Truth* proved your words were true, I couldn’t help but be amazed. I want to be among those you cherish. So let me rephrase the question. The kids have been with you from the start, so that makes sense, but what can I do now to earn your trust?”

“Trust and faith aren’t built in a single moment. You’re being too hasty, and I don’t believe you’re unaware of that. What is it you truly want to say?”

I said this, but deep down, I had a rough idea of why she was acting this way. Simply put, that incident was her trauma. But my presence had shaken that trauma, and now she was floundering. She was scared but wanted to hold on. That urgency was driving her now.

“To you, User Jeong Ha-yeon has no value. So, in the end, there’s only one thing left.”

“User Jeong Ha-yeon.”

She responded in a low voice.

“As a woman, not a user. That’s the only value I have left to offer you.”

Hearing her words, I gazed at her with a cold stare. She met my eyes without a hint of wavering. After a brief silence, I stood up from my seat.

“Of course, I’m a man before I’m a user, and I’m attracted to women. I have basic desires. However.”

I paused, then continued in a disappointed tone.

“I’m not someone who sleeps with just any woman for no reason.”

“That’s not what I meant—”

I knew that wasn’t what she meant. But she still hadn’t given me the answer I wanted. Before she could finish, I turned away and added one last remark.

“I’m disappointed it’s come to this. I’ll take my leave.”

And at that moment.

“I…!”

Her soft cry stopped me as I moved toward the door.

“Do you think I’m the kind of woman who would sleep with just any man?”

Her tearful words made me sigh and turn back.

“Your words could certainly be misunderstood that way. I know you’re not that kind of woman, but honestly, this sudden behavior is bewildering.”

At my honest response, she looked up at me with a conflicted expression. But the conflict didn’t last long. After a brief moment, her lips slowly parted.

“Yu-jeong said I don’t know you well, but I think I know you fairly well. While helping the kids train, I always heard about you. You’re so similar to him. Leading people during the Rite of Passage. Earning the kids’ trust. Ranking first at the User Academy. Getting an offer from the Golden Lion Clan. But when you rejected their offer and chose to stay with the kids, that’s when your path diverged from his.”

“So, are you seeing me as a substitute for him?”

When I pointed out a sensitive possibility, Jeong Ha-yeon hurriedly shook her head.

“No! It’s just… I’m tired of the deceit and betrayal in the Hall Plane. I couldn’t deceive others either. I could if I tried, but I refused to do the very thing I despise. So I decided back then: I won’t deceive others, and I won’t be deceived.”

So that’s why she was like this. Resolving one question, I turned back and stood beside her. She gently pressed her forehead against my chest and continued.

“But… User Kim Su-hyeon is different. There’s something about you that sets you apart from other users in the Hall Plane. Maybe I’m at my limit. After the *Crystal of Truth*, I started thinking that way. That I need to hold on to you, that you’re my last chance in the Hall Plane. You said you wanted my trust and faith, didn’t you?”

“…Yes.”

Still pressing her forehead against my chest, Ha-yeon looked up at me. I met her gaze, lowering my eyes further, and gently ran my hand through her hair. She closed her eyes as if savoring my touch, but her words didn’t stop.

“Honestly, I still have doubts. If you had such immense power, you wouldn’t have let Ji-yeon die. Or rather, you could have prevented it. But I won’t ask you about it. I’ll bury it in my heart as it is.”

“I can fully explain that part.”

“I’ve heard bits and pieces from the kids, and I have my own guesses. I’ve seen some things with my own eyes too. It’s not as good as hearing it from you, but I’ve chosen to think this way. I’m tired of being deceived and hurt by it. But I’m still a woman. After losing the sister I trusted and relied on, I’ve felt myself wavering.”

“So you think leaning on me will help you steady yourself?”

She nodded silently at my question. Confirming her response, I gently pulled her face back into my embrace, and she buried her face in my chest without resistance. At that moment, a deep smile curled on my lips.

I’m sorry, but she’d fallen into another delusion. Honestly, I hadn’t expected Jeong Ha-yeon to act this way. Hearing her full story was a first for me too. But it wasn’t bad. Right now, I didn’t need vague possibilities of trust or faith. If I embraced her now, our relationship would undeniably take a significant step forward.

I felt no guilt. I had cast aside such feelings when I witnessed their deaths and chose to return. For their sake, I could do anything without hesitation. Feeling a tickle in my chest, I took a deep breath and spoke quietly.

“That sounds like a mage’s way of thinking.”

“…It does. I can give you my trust and, at the same time, find stability for myself. I need a place to rest and rely on. Everything I’ve said tonight is the greatest trust I can show you right now. So…”

She rose from her chair, slowly climbing onto me. Her arms gently wrapped around my neck, and she pressed herself against me, speaking softly.

“Tonight, I hope you’ll respond to my trust, Su-hyeon.”
