# Memorize - Chapter 130: Temporary Alliance

When Go Yeon-ju readily agreed, I felt a surge of astonishment. Indeed, Go Yeon-ju was different from the other <Ten Strongest>. She used her status wisely, never abusing it. She maintained a proper balance, upholding her dignity without provoking strong resentment in others.  
Though her agreement came with the condition of teaching the basics, I couldn’t help but think she was a truly remarkable user. The thought that Yu-jeong could finally grow filled me with a pleasant smile.  

“Thank you. I didn’t expect you to actually agree.”  

“Hmm. You didn’t seem *that* grateful when I offered the entire inn, but this seems to really mean something to you,” she teased. “But… the user who’s supposed to learn doesn’t look too thrilled, does she?”  

At her words, I quickly turned to Yu-jeong. As Go Yeon-ju had pointed out, Yu-jeong’s face was sullen. If I had to put her expression into words, it was something like, *“Oppa promised to teach me. Why…?”*—a look of deep betrayal.  

Her reaction made me sigh inwardly. *This immature girl.* She clearly had no idea what a huge opportunity had just come her way. The finer details were undoubtedly Go Yeon-ju’s unilateral favor. If someone offered such generosity and received this kind of response, even I would feel put off.  

I stole a glance at Go Yeon-ju’s expression. She was simply smiling, showing no particular signs of displeasure. Alternating her gaze between Yu-jeong and me, she seemed to grasp the situation and gave a playful grin.  

“Well, I’m always ready to teach. But once we start, I won’t go easy. So… if you really want to learn, come find me later, you little brat. *Tch, tch.*”  

Go Yeon-ju’s final tongue-click conveyed her true feelings. It wasn’t anger but rather the sentiment of someone looking at immature users yet to mature in the ways of Hall Plane. Ha-yeon, perhaps not wanting to miss this chance, kept shooting Yu-jeong pointed looks to seize the opportunity. (As an aside, An-hyeon was beside himself, practically begging to take Yu-jeong’s place if she didn’t want it.)  

“…Tch.”  

At Go Yeon-ju’s mocking tone, Yu-jeong ground her teeth and whipped her head away in response. As she often did, Go Yeon-ju shrugged and looked at me. I sent her an apologetic glance and decided it was time to wrap things up.  

It seemed I’d need to have a serious talk with Yu-jeong soon.  

After breakfast, the group returned to their usual schedule. Ha-yeon, with a calm expression, grabbed An-sol’s hand and dragged her up the stairs. An-sol’s rabbit-like eyes quivered as her lips trembled, but no one came to her rescue.  

Go Yeon-ju, taking advantage of the moment, decided to clear the first-floor tables to make space for training. She insisted she could handle it alone, but An-hyeon, brimming with enthusiasm, loudly insisted on helping. When Go Yeon-ju commented, “An-hyeon is quite the gentleman,” he twisted his body, trying to look dignified.  

An-hyeon’s behavior wasn’t surprising, but Shin Sang-yong stepping up to help Go Yeon-ju was unexpected. Seeing his warm smile, I figured he was probably thinking along the same lines as me. I gave him a slight nod of thanks, and he shook his head lightly, as if to say it was no big deal.  

Yu-jeong, clearly upset, stormed up the stairs. I watched her retreating figure for a moment before slowly standing. In the past, I would’ve scolded her on the spot, but after the Ruined Laboratory, I knew how much she cared about me. Understanding her feelings, I decided to console her gently.  

Just as I was about to follow her, Go Yeon-ju, who had been rearranging tables, grabbed my arm. Sensing my intention, she shook her head.  

“Don’t go. Just let her be.”  

“Huh?”  

“I said, let her be. I’ve noticed this before and wanted to tell you. It’s not a good look for the caravan leader to micromanage every little issue like this. Especially in a case like this, it’s better to let her figure it out on her own.”  

“But…”  

As I hesitated, I felt a tug on my left hand. Turning, I saw Vivian holding it cautiously, her expression careful.  

“Kim Su-hyeon, I agree with her. I didn’t want to say this before, but you tend to get dragged around by the kids too much. Especially by those two who aren’t here right now. So, don’t go.”  

“Hyung, don’t go,” An-hyeon chimed in, almost like a founding member of the group. “She was acting all high and mighty in the laboratory, but now she’s just the same. You went out of your way to give her this opportunity, and it’s frustrating to watch her react like this. Since it’s come to this… Shadow Queen-nim, I’m actually a pretty decent user too…”  

With even An-hyeon joining in, I finally closed my mouth. Honestly, Go Yeon-ju’s words weren’t wrong—they were spot-on. The moment she spoke, I wanted to retort, *“My kid isn’t like that!”* like a protective parent, which only made me feel sadder.  

“Hoho. Buzz off,” Go Yeon-ju lightly rebuffed An-hyeon’s advances, pushing my back gently but firmly. (Her blunt words left An-hyeon visibly wounded.) As she nudged me, I sank into thought. Even I could see that my recent behavior was a far cry from my first cycle. I’d thought of this softer side as just a persona, confident I could revert to my old self if needed.  

After all, these kids trusted and followed me… My thoughts trailed off, and I caught myself. A bitter smile crept up as I realized something.  

Maybe it wasn’t just the kids getting swept up in the atmosphere. Perhaps I, too, had been caught up in it.  

In my first cycle, I was alone. Sure, there was Hyung and *her*, but they had plenty of users following them. I was just one among many. Strictly speaking, I was alone.  

But now, things were different.  

I wasn’t the one orbiting other users—users were orbiting me. Seeing kids look for me the moment they woke up stirred unfamiliar emotions, ones that felt… nice. Maybe that’s why I’d unconsciously started paying more attention to them.  

Forcing Vivian’s lingering grip off my hand, I calmly climbed the stairs. My plan was to head to the office suite and adjust our upcoming schedule.  

*  

“Kim Su-hyeon. Kim Su-hyeon.”  

As I reached the third floor, Vivian’s voice followed, her footsteps pattering behind me. I turned with a blank expression, only to find her clutching my sleeve tightly. I swatted her hand away and spoke.  

“What’s with you? Let go and talk.”  

“Okay, okay. But I have a question.”  

“What is it?”  

What could she possibly be so curious about to look at me with such an earnest expression? Thinking it must be something serious, I leaned in to listen. Vivian opened her mouth immediately.  

“What does ‘woo-boo-nam’ mean?”  

“…Why are you asking about that?”  

“That woman earlier said she’s confident she could handle a ‘woo-boo-nam’ too.”  

I sighed. “Think about the context. She said ‘a man with kids,’ right? It means a married man, someone with a wife.”  

Vivian’s eyes widened. “What?! You’re married?”  

“Don’t be ridiculous. There’s no way I’d be married at my age.”  

Relieved, she continued, “Then why did she say that to you?”  

I sighed again. Given Vivian’s usual cluelessness, it seemed everyone else had understood Go Yeon-ju’s meaning. Since she’d brushed it off herself, I decided to let it slide.  

Looking at Vivian, who tilted her head with a question mark practically floating above it, I began explaining calmly. I told her how the kids sometimes called me “Dad,” which could be interpreted as me having a wife, and that Go Yeon-ju was likely teasing me on purpose.  

After my detailed explanation, Vivian nodded as if she finally got it and burst into giggles.  

“Hoho. That’s funny. You guys use such amusing terms sometimes. Woo-boo-nam, huh?”  

“It’s not ‘woo-boo-nam,’ it’s ‘yoo-boo-nam.’ Anyway, mark my words. From now on, anyone who calls me ‘Dad’ or ‘yoo-boo-nam’ or anything like that is getting a good spanking.”  

“Spanking?”  

“Yeah, a smack on the butt.”  

I said it half-jokingly, half-seriously, but being called “Dad” at twenty-four wasn’t exactly pleasant. At my words, Vivian’s eyes sparkled for a moment before her cheeks flushed slightly.  

“Oh? So, Kim Su-hyeon doesn’t like being called Dad or yoo-boo-nam?”  

“Exactly.”  

“I see. You’re not their dad, and you don’t have a wife.”  

Her repetitive twisting of my words started to irk me. Frowning, I growled, “Are you messing with me right now?”  

But Vivian, ignoring me, kept nodding to herself and turned around, subtly sticking out her hips.  

“…”  

I had half a mind to give her a good kick, but that felt like playing into her hands. Instead, I tapped her head lightly and stepped into the third floor. The growing number of companions was nice, but I had a sinking feeling things were about to get a lot noisier.

<Northern Continent Major City Barbara - Golden Lion Clan House>  

“Come to think of it, they’re making an announcement tomorrow, right?”  

“What? Oh, *that*? Yeah, I heard about it too. Probably trying to boost morale and attract more people before the plan kicks off. The Golden Lion Clan sure loves showing off.”  

“Hey, watch it. Anyway, she’s got it good. The Golden Lion Clan is totally backing her. I worked my butt off to get in here, but someone just gets a good class, hooks up with the right guy, and waltzes in within a year. Ugh, it’s so annoying.”  

“A year? Try zero years. It pisses me off too. That smug little brat with her haughty eyes—I can’t stand her.”  

“Shh, keep it down. Don’t you know Park Hyeon-woo’s got her back?”  

“Ugh, whatever. Modern world or Hall Plane, it’s all the same. Anyway, if they make that announcement tomorrow, her smug face is gonna get even worse. Just thinking about it makes my blood boil.”  

“Pfft, true.”  

The snarky voices faded, and silence settled over the corridor. In a shadowy corner, a lone user stood motionless.  

She was a woman, strikingly beautiful. Her glossy blue-black hair cascaded past her ears, draping over her shoulders. Beneath her refined nose sat small, cherry-like lips, neatly aligned. Her skin, visible in patches, was as fair as fresh snow.  

Her expression was icy, though it suited her perfectly. Yet, one couldn’t help but think a slight smile would make her even more stunning.  

But right now, her face was so cold it radiated frost. Her eyes held a calm, almost eerie stillness, as if she’d lost all emotion.  

Upon closer inspection, however, subtle signs emerged. Her long, slender eyebrows were slightly raised, and her forehead was faintly creased.  

Her tranquil gaze lingered on the corridor where the voices had passed.  

“Ha…”  

Suddenly, she parted her beautiful lips and let out a sigh, revealing her pearly, even teeth.  

For a while, she stared down the corridor before lowering her gaze to her hand. In it was a gem, glowing with a clear light. Unconsciously, she gripped it tightly, as if to crush it, but then relaxed her hand, letting the gem fall to the floor.  

*Thud, clatter.*  

As the gem rolled across the corridor, a sorrowful expression flickered across her face for the first time. In a hollow voice, she whispered a name.  

“Su-hyeon oppa…”  

The woman was none other than Kim Han-byeol, the Jewel Mage.
