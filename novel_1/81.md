# Chapter 80: New Face

“Hyung, I have a question.”

“Yeah?”

“Are you… waiting for those users right now?”

The moment An-hyeon finished speaking, everyone froze. Yu-jeong, who was about to kick An-hyeon’s shin, stopped mid-motion. Vivian, sitting nearby and trying to calm her down, paused. Even Sol, quietly observing, went still. It was as if a spell of silence had been cast, with only the sound of breathing filling the air. All eyes were fixed on An-hyeon and me.

I looked at An-hyeon with a gaze that said, *What’s this guy up to?* His eyes sparkled with a mix of politeness and energy.

In the past, the kids had once recklessly suggested going on an expedition and got a thorough scolding from me. Since then, they’d been quietly avoiding the topic among themselves. But now, An-hyeon was indirectly bringing it up. His question essentially boiled down to, *Are we holding off on the next expedition because you’re waiting for those users?*

I glanced at An-hyeon and the others with a calm, sunken gaze before speaking in a composed tone.

“Yes. I’m waiting for those two right now.”

“Ah…”

A short sigh escaped An-hyeon’s lips as I observed the group’s reactions. An-hyeon nodded slightly, Yu-jeong tilted her head in confusion, Sol’s expression was complex and subtle, and Vivian’s face darkened slightly.

“So, are you planning to add more people to our group?” Yu-jeong asked.

I set down my chopsticks, interlaced my fingers, and rested my chin on them before continuing.

“I was going to bring this up eventually, but it might be better to talk about it now.”

“Are you talking about adding more members to our group?” An-hyeon asked.

“That, and also about the clan we’re going to create.”

I reached into my pocket and pulled out a cigarette. The surroundings were noisy—users chatting loudly, others picking fights, some getting chased out for trying to touch Go Yeon-ju’s backside, and groups having serious discussions. I put the cigarette to my lips and lit it.

“But will they really come? We’re still in our zeroth year, and they seemed to have some experience…” An-sol trailed off.

While most of the group nodded in agreement with her, there was one thing they overlooked—Vivian.

“Strictly speaking, we don’t really need another mage in our caravan right now,” I said.

“Huh? Weren’t we short on mage users?” Yu-jeong asked.

“Not anymore. We have Vivian.”

All eyes turned to Vivian. She was in the middle of slurping noodles and froze, caught off guard, with a few strands dangling from her mouth. A brief silence followed as the noodles swayed in the air. Her face gradually crumpled into a pout. I spoke up to ease her embarrassment.

“Vivian, it’s okay. You can keep eating. You guys, too—eat while you listen.”

But not a single person picked up their chopsticks. Vivian, looking even more embarrassed, quickly finished her noodles and set her chopsticks down neatly. I reached out to wipe some food from the corner of her mouth, but she flinched slightly. Hearing Yu-jeong’s breathing grow heavier, I quickly withdrew my hand.

“You all saw her before, but Vivian is an incredibly skilled mage. Remember that female mage we saw in the plaza after the Rite of Passage? The one called Yu-bin?”

“That girl who was trailing after Park Hyeon-woo?” Yu-jeong asked.

“Yeah. She’s somewhat well-known in Barbara, but even if two mages like her came, they wouldn’t be able to beat Vivian.”

An-hyeon and An-sol looked at Vivian with renewed interest. Vivian let out a small cough and straightened her posture. Yu-jeong’s expression was less than pleased, but she didn’t say anything further.

“Three close-combat fighters, one mage, one priest. Our caravan’s balance might be perfect as it is. But the reason I’m still waiting for those two mages is because they fit the criteria I have in mind for the clan I want to build.”

I paused, took a long drag of my cigarette, and exhaled. Watching the faint smoke curl into the air, I gave a satisfied smile. The kids waited quietly for my next words.

“The clan I want to create has two defining traits: a small, elite group and a mercenary-like nature.”

“Small and elite… and mercenary?” An-hyeon echoed, clearly puzzled.

The others tilted their heads as well. Honestly, explaining a mercenary-style clan was a bit complex, and I wasn’t confident I could make them fully understand. But I figured it was better to give a simple explanation now.

“‘Small and elite’ is exactly what it sounds like. When we form a clan and start recruiting, I don’t want to take just anyone. I want only top-tier users or those with the potential to become top-tier.”

This was something only I could do. I could recruit well-known top-tier users based on their reputation, but spotting those with untapped potential was harder without my Third Eye. Some users show promise early on, while others are late bloomers. The key to identifying them was their stat points. I also remembered a few promising newcomers who would arrive soon, giving us a significant advantage in the recruitment race. However…

“To do that, our clan needs to build a reputation. If our clan looks like just another small group, even promising recruits might turn down our offers. That’s why I want to create a mercenary-style clan.”

Vivian and Sol listened intently, but An-hyeon and Yu-jeong’s faces were starting to scrunch up. They weren’t dumb, and their minds worked quickly enough, but this kind of talk seemed to make their brains stall. I took another puff of my cigarette to give them a moment to process.

Yu-jeong, ever impatient, spoke first.

“Oppa, I don’t get it. What does a mercenary-style clan have to do with building a reputation?”

“Mercenaries take on requests for payment. Right now, no other clan operates like that. Most clans just take on missions assigned by Barbara or tied to their city’s role. If a mercenary-style clan emerges, it’s bound to attract attention.”

“Still… I don’t know if it’ll work out that easily. Won’t the established clans just scoff at us?”

I gave a faint smile. By the time we leave Mul, I plan to reveal that I’m a Sword Specialist and that Vivian is a Chimera Alchemist. Plus, we have the potential to create another Chimera Alchemist and, if luck allows, turn An-hyeon into a Ki-Gong Spearmaster. A clan with one Secret Class and three Rare Classes? No one would dare dismiss us.

The answer was a resounding *no*. Sure, we might not get many requests at first, but on the flip side, clans eager to merge with us would line up. My plan was to maintain neutrality while steadily growing our influence.

Sol, who had been deep in thought, quietly raised her hand.

“Oppa, are you thinking of registering as free mercenaries?”

“Exactly.”

As expected, our star pupil An-sol hit the nail on the head. She gave a shy smile before continuing.

“I was wondering why you didn’t register as a Northern Continent citizen. So that was your plan. But I heard that free mercenaries, and their clans, face disadvantages compared to registered users or clans.”

“It’s not exactly a disadvantage. It’s more that we don’t get certain privileges. But those privileges? They’re mostly useless. Think of it as maintaining our current lifestyle without being tied down.”

Free mercenary registration. A free mercenary clan. It meant we wouldn’t be bound to the Northern Continent or any city within it. Regular users are obligated to answer emergency summons, but free mercenaries are exempt from such responsibilities. Sure, we miss out on the so-called privileges Sol mentioned, but when you look closely, they’re laughably trivial.

Things like tax breaks when buying a personal house or a clan house for the guild, protection from vagrants, priority selection for large-scale expeditions, or city support for recovery after a major setback. At first glance, these seem appealing, but they’re all just shiny baubles. In the later stages of Hall Plane, they’re practically worthless. There are other privileges, sure, but they’re just as inconsequential. Looking to the future, the freedom of being a free mercenary far outweighs these fleeting benefits.

That future isn’t far off. It’s been a month since we arrived in Mul, so in two months, the Golden Lion Clan’s Steel Mountains expedition will begin. Then come the civil wars. In that context, those privileges are as good as scrap paper. That’s when the free mercenary status will truly shine, giving us the justification and power to act freely.

A clan unbound by any continent or city, able to act boldly while maintaining neutrality—that’s the strength and legitimacy I’m aiming for.

But I couldn’t lay all this out now. For one, the kids weren’t ready to judge what’s right or wrong in this world. They were starting to grasp combat, but that was it. Expecting them to understand the intricate flow of Hall Plane’s dynamics was a bit much for newcomers. Still, if we don’t ride that flow, we’ll end up left behind.

A brief silence fell over the table. The surrounding noise had quieted considerably. I noticed an invisible barrier around us and glanced at Vivian. She winked, signaling she’d put up a shield to keep our conversation private, sensing its importance. I responded with a bright smile.

“Honestly, it was the same when we left Barbara,” An-hyeon said, letting out a big sigh. “But you pulled it off, Hyung. I don’t understand everything yet, but I’ll trust you and follow your lead.”

I nodded.

“Good. We’ve got time, so think it over slowly. I’m certain the day will come when the value of being free mercenaries shines. I truly believe that.”

Yu-jeong nodded blankly, clearly not fully grasping it. An-sol rebelling against me was unimaginable, and Vivian, bound by our contract, would follow wherever I led. An-hyeon, on the other hand, seemed a bit excited by the idea of a small, elite group, his face slightly flushed.

“So, Oppa, you think that woman has the potential to be a top-tier user?” Yu-jeong asked.

“Yep. Her, and all of you, too.”

“Heh… But what about that guy? Shin Sang-yong, was it? I’m not so sure about him.”

At Yu-jeong’s words, I recalled Shin Sang-yong’s user information from memory.

---

**User Information (Player Status)**  
1. **Name**: Shin Sang-yong (Year 2)  
2. **Class**: Normal Mage Expert  
3. **Nation**: Barbara  
4. **Clan**: None  
5. **True Name · Nationality**: Seeker of the Truth of Magic Circles · South Korea  
6. **Sex**: Male (28)  
7. **Height · Weight**: 183.7 cm · 69.2 kg  
8. **Alignment**: Lawful · True  
**[Strength 40] [Endurance 42] [Agility 45] [Stamina 40] [Magic 85] [Luck 60]**

I’ve said it before, but for mages, it’s all about Magic stats. As long as Strength, Endurance, and Agility aren’t abysmally low, Magic is the top priority. That’s why I currently rank Jeong Ha-yeon above Shin Sang-yong.

Of course, having high Magic *and* high other stats would be ideal, but that’s practically cheating—like me.

For a Year 2 user, Shin Sang-yong’s stats are solid, showing potential to become a top-tier user. But I’m still reserving judgment on him. His True Name, *Seeker of the Truth of Magic Circles*, is something I’ve never seen before, so I can’t evaluate him carelessly. I regretted not using my Third Eye to check his Special and Potential Abilities back then.

Just then—

“Kim Su-hyeon.”

Go Yeon-ju’s soft voice called my name, and I heard the inn’s door creak open behind me. Familiar footsteps followed. *Speak of the devil*, I thought. It seems they’ve come back today.
