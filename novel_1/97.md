# Memorize - Chapter 96: Can You Keep Up?

As I opened the door, a strange mist flowed out from within. At the same time, a low, guttural growl reached my ears.

“Grrrr…”

The sound carried an unmistakable malice, thick and oppressive.

Stepping inside, my party and I were left speechless by the vast plaza before us. It wasn’t the sheer size of the space that stole our words—though it was immense, dwarfing the combined area of the four or five rooms we’d passed through on the first floor. No, it was the overwhelming presence of a single creature standing tall in the center, its posture rigid and commanding.

It was enormous, its head nearly brushing the high ceiling. The upper body resembled a human’s, covered in what looked like solid muscle, but its skin gleamed with a metallic hardness rather than the softness of human flesh. Lowering my gaze, I saw that instead of human legs, it had a long, serpentine tail, fused into a single, sinuous form.

A human torso atop a snake’s lower body.

“Gigas…? No, that can’t be. Why would a mythical creature be in the Hall Plane…?”

I quickly activated my Third Eye. As I read the information about the monster before me, I couldn’t help but gasp in shock. What in the world had the former inhabitants of the Hall Plane done? More importantly, the fact that this creature still existed meant it hadn’t been deemed worthy as a sacrifice. If a monster of this caliber wasn’t suitable as an offering, what kind of demon awaited us on the third floor?

“Insane…”

“A giant…”

My party members let out stunned exclamations, staring up at the Gigas with dazed expressions. For a moment, we stood locked in a tense standoff. Then, I noticed the corner of the creature’s mouth curl upward. It was mocking us. In that instant, a spark of anger flared in my eyes. How dare this counterfeit monster sneer at me?

Fuming, I shot it a glare laced with killing intent, and the Gigas took a step back. I bit my lip and quickly turned to my party, barking orders.

“Vivian. Keeper.”

“What, what?” Vivian’s eyes widened as she responded, clearly taken aback. The others looked equally confused. To them, it must have seemed irrational to assign Vivian, who had been one of our most active members, to the role of Keeper when facing such a formidable opponent.

A Keeper’s role is to step back from direct combat, protecting the party’s priests or mages. While Vivian had often taken on this role during our time together and occasionally joined the fray when maintaining formation wasn’t feasible, in large-scale expeditions, a Keeper’s primary duty was protection. Even though she could provide ranged support as a mage, assigning a mage to Keeper duty was unconventional.

“It may look like a Gigas on the surface, but it’s just an experimental creation. A hybrid of a giant and a basilisk. No matter how strong it is, it was made by humans, and humans can deal with it. Don’t forget—this thing is considered less than a hundred other sacrifices.”

“B-But still…” The party hesitated, their voices faltering.

I pressed on firmly, leaving no room for doubt. Honestly, a fully matured giant or basilisk alone would be incredibly powerful. Combined, I couldn’t even begin to predict the extent of its strength. I’d faced them separately before, but this fused abomination was a first for me. All I could do was make the best choice available.

“Since it has giant’s blood, it’s better for mages and priests to stay out of direct combat. Provide support with auxiliary magic only. An-hyeon, Yu-jeong, this is a free-for-all. I’ll take the front and charge first. Your job is to back me up, focus on distracting it, and prioritize evasion. Everyone else, support as best you can.”

I cut through their hesitation with decisive words. At the mention of a free-for-all, the kids’ faces paled. As I turned to face the creature, Jeong Ha-yeon’s urgent voice called out from behind.

“Su-hyeon! Wouldn’t it be better to form a defensive formation…?”

“This is better than a formation.”

“What?”

“There’s no time to explain. Trust me, this is the way.”

“Grrrr…”

As soon as I finished speaking, the Gigas finally moved. Its massive serpentine body writhed, then slithered toward us with alarming speed. There was no time to waste. Yet, even in that moment, Ha-yeon seemed to be mulling over my words.

She would understand. Against this Gigas, a defensive formation would only work if our caravan was fully equipped and doubled in size. With our current composition and state, a formation would be a clumsy, ineffective response.

Of course, my plan wasn’t without flaws. But it boiled down to one simple truth: if I could hold the Gigas at bay single-handedly from the front, all our problems would be solved. I saw a spark of realization in Ha-yeon’s eyes, her expression tinged with worry, as I charged forward.

The others, initially hesitant, scrambled to follow as I rushed ahead. I’d half-expected them to freeze in fear, but it seemed they couldn’t abandon their “big brother.” With a faint smile, I picked up my pace.

As the distance between me and the Gigas closed, I saw it raise its right arm with all its might, clearly intending to crush me. In response, I raised my sword high. I intended to break its spirit with our first clash.

At that moment, a message floated into view.

『Potential Ability: Close-Quarters Combat (Rank: A Plus) has been activated. Close-Quarters Combat is a skill that surpasses the limits for those wielding close-range weapons. Rank A+. This is not merely combat prowess but the pinnacle of human potential in melee combat. You will never be outmatched in close-quarters fighting.』

---

Jeong Ha-yeon stared ahead, her face set in a grim expression. Her mind kept replaying the brief exchange with Kim Su-hyeon.

“Su-hyeon! Wouldn’t it be better to form a defensive formation…?”

“This is better than a formation.”

“What?”

“There’s no time to explain. Trust me, this is the way.”

Ha-yeon bit her lip hard. Su-hyeon wasn’t reckless. Though they hadn’t been together long, his leadership was unparalleled. His decisions weren’t flashy, but they were always calm, logical, and methodical. Even veterans who’d survived years in the Hall Plane couldn’t match his seasoned command.

Yet, for the first time, he’d done something she couldn’t comprehend. Or rather, she could understand it, and she could guess what he was aiming for. His words echoed in her mind: *It’s better for mages and priests to stay out of direct combat.* But his eyes, in that final glance, had said something else.

*If you’re confident you won’t get in the way, do what you can.*

“Is he saying to stay out of it if I can’t contribute…?” Ha-yeon muttered bitterly.

A piercing scream cut through her thoughts.

“Kyaaa! Oppa! Oppa, nooo!”

Startled, Ha-yeon looked up to see the Gigas and Kim Su-hyeon on the verge of a head-on collision. Without thinking, she clapped a hand over her mouth. She’d hoped there was another way, but to think he’d face it like *that*…

**BOOM!**

Before her thoughts could fully form, the two collided, and a deafening roar shook the room. The impact reverberated in all directions.

“Hurry, cast a healing spell!”

“I’m trying! Unni, Oppa, don’t just stand there—go help him!”

An-sol, usually so meek, was shouting frantically, but her words trailed off. Her lips parted wider, her eyes turning vacant. Following her gaze, the party turned to the scene of the clash, and a collective gasp escaped them.

“No… way.”

It was an unbelievable sight. In the collision between Kim Su-hyeon and the Gigas, Su-hyeon had the clear upper hand. With a single strike, the Gigas staggered back significantly.

As the party stared in disbelief, only Vivian continued calmly chanting her spell. Having glimpsed Su-hyeon’s true strength before, she wasn’t as shocked as the others, though even she hadn’t expected *this*. Since she’d already committed to their cause, she didn’t dwell on it. Finishing her incantation, she called out in a clear, resonant voice.

“Arise, Imprison! The Iron Binder of the 49th Legion!”

At her voice, Shin Sang-yong, An-sol, and Jeong Ha-yeon snapped to attention. Thus, Vivian took her role as Keeper while simultaneously supporting Su-hyeon. A familiar beast appeared above a magic circle, and as it unleashed chains at her command, Ha-yeon resolved to join the fight. She couldn’t just stand by idly.

*The question is, which spell to use…*

Countless spells flashed through Ha-yeon’s mind, rising and falling. One spell, however, lingered. She glanced at Shin Sang-yong and An-sol, her eyes growing colder.

“Miss An-sol.”

“Y-Yes?”

“Prepare a binding spell. And Mr. Shin Sang-yong.”

Her voice was low but carried an undeniable authority, brooking no argument. When she called Shin Sang-yong, he nodded immediately.

“Yes.”

“Prepare *that* spell. Please.”

“*That* spell…?”

Shin Sang-yong looked at her blankly. There was only one spell that came to mind when she said “that.” Whether magic would even affect a giant was uncertain, but given Ha-yeon’s superior mastery of magical application, he trusted she had a plan. With a determined expression, he responded.

“…Understood. Which element for the synergy spell?”

“Fire-based, please. I’ll handle the water-based overlap.”

Their conversation moved swiftly. An-sol, unable to keep up, merely nodded vigorously, looking lost. Ha-yeon felt a surge of frustration but suppressed it and spoke.

“I’ll designate the target. Miss An-sol, just complete the binding spell and release it on my signal.”

“Th-Three magic applications at once? That’s too much, even for you!”

“I can do it. Just in case, do your best.”

Ha-yeon paused, turning her gaze forward. The chains Vivian had unleashed were wrapping around the Gigas’s right arm, which was poised to strike. They didn’t fully restrain it, but they bought enough time. Seizing the moment, Kim Su-hyeon launched himself off the ground, soaring into the air and swinging his sword.

A brilliant sword aura erupted from his blade, bending like a whip. The flexible energy lashed out, striking the Gigas’s sturdy body with force. The creature let out a pained scream, retreating further. In close-quarters combat, it was being thoroughly outmatched by Kim Su-hyeon. Ha-yeon’s throat tightened at the sight.

“Target the left arm. Create a momentary opening. We’ll bind both arms.”

“Y-Yes…”

“Got it.”

Shin Sang-yong closed his eyes and began chanting. An-sol, sensing the gravity of the situation, quietly raised her staff and murmured her incantation. After confirming their actions, Ha-yeon started her own casting, slightly delayed. She was the last to begin but was confident she’d finish first.

“───. Teeth of Crystal!”

“───. Burn Flare!”

Ha-yeon completed her spell in an instant. Moments later, she saw Shin Sang-yong and An-sol finish theirs. In Ha-yeon’s hand shimmered icy frost, while a searing fireball floated above Shin Sang-yong’s. They exchanged a glance and nodded in unison.
