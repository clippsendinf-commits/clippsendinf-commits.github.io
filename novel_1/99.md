# Memorize - Chapter 98: Can You Keep Up?

Using the momentum of my descent, I slashed down with all my might from the crown of its head.  
*Crunch. Crack. Thud.*  
Though I had infused the strike with a surge of mana, Gigas’s stone-hard body split cleanly in half without the slightest resistance. Watching the creature’s bisected upper body slowly collapse, I planted my feet firmly on the ground.  
*Boom!*  
The sound of its massive frame hitting the floor was as grand as its size. There was no sense of relief from defeating a tough monster. From the moment of our first clash, I knew this thing was no match for me. Still, I felt a flicker of gratitude toward my party members, who had followed my slightly unconventional orders so well.  

“Hyung, well done!”  
An-hyeon had quietly approached from behind. I hadn’t closely observed him this time, but I could see a few dents in the armor we’d carefully prepared. Since the mages and I had mostly kept its arms pinned, he’d likely taken a few glancing blows from its tail or body.  
With a rare, sparkling expression in his eyes, An-hyeon spoke up.  
“You’re really incredible, hyung.”  
“What’s that? The mages did most of the work.”  
“Still, I never would’ve dreamed you’d finish it off in one blow like that.”  
“It wasn’t exactly one blow…”  
I trailed off ambiguously. An-hyeon’s expression was growing increasingly intense, so I quickened my pace to escape it. I heard Yu-jeong call out from behind, asking to walk together, but I ignored her and kept moving.  

The faces of the party members were a sight to behold. Was it really that shocking that I’d taken it down in one strike? Regardless, they’d all worked hard, so I spoke in a gentle tone to ease the mood.  
“Impressive magical coordination. Thanks to all of you, I got a perfect opening.”  
“Ah… y-yeah… User Kim Su-hyeon, you were amazing too. Haha.”  
Shin Sang-yong responded with a dazed look, unable to hide his flustered thoughts. It wasn’t just his expression—his shift from calling me “Leader” to my full name betrayed his unease.  
An-sol let out a sigh of relief. Scanning the others’ faces, I found nothing particularly unusual. Having spent enough time with me, they probably just thought, “He’s impressive,” without harboring any suspicions.  
But Shin Sang-yong and Jeong Ha-yeon were different. In this battle, I’d revealed a glimpse of my strength, and even that glimpse was enough to show I far surpassed the average Year 0 user. In other words, I’d made it clear I wasn’t like other users of my cohort.  

After briefly locking eyes with Shin Sang-yong and Jeong Ha-yeon, I spoke calmly.  
“You used quite a bit of magic there. Are you both holding up okay?”  
“I’m… fine. But…”  
Jeong Ha-yeon paused after saying “but.” A flurry of conflicted emotions crossed her face. A heavy silence hung in the air before her pale lips parted again.  
“…still, didn’t we make things a bit easier for you?”  
She quickly composed herself, responding in her usual clear, professional tone. Hearing her reply, I barely suppressed a smile. *So that’s how it is.* Unlike Kim Han-byeol, she knew how to read the situation. Was she choosing to hold back and observe for now?  
Her response exceeded my expectations, and I couldn’t help but let a faint smile slip through.  
“Yes, it was very helpful.”  
“Hehe. I’m looking forward to the next battle.”  
The rest of the party quietly listened to our exchange. Shin Sang-yong seemed to want to say something, but Jeong Ha-yeon didn’t give him an opening, so he just scratched his head.  

I decided to take a short break. In that moment, I made up my mind. I would mark both of them as prime candidates for recruitment into the clan, just like Go Yeon-ju. Based on the conversation and atmosphere, they seemed likely to accept, but there was always the chance they’d refuse.  
If they refused… should I kill them?  
No, there was no need for that. They could be troublesome as enemies, but unlike Go Yeon-ju, who was an adversary in my first cycle, I’d need to think it over more carefully.  
As the party rested, I kept tapping the ground with my finger.  

---  

To put it simply, my concerns were unfounded.  
After leaving Gigas’s room, we opened the two remaining doors in the initial chamber. One contained a pseudo-Cockatrice, and the other unleashed a horde of enhanced undead.  
In terms of difficulty, it went Gigas, Cockatrice, then the undead. But with our upgraded equipment and recent experience, we handled them far more easily than the previous day. Of course, my more proactive involvement played a big part, but the party’s growing experience couldn’t be ignored either.  

“It seems my predictions were off. I’m sorry.”  
Shin Sang-yong apologized in a dejected tone.  
We had crossed a passageway connecting the bisected chambers and entered the next area. Like the previous one, this space also had three doors. Unlike the last area, where a door stood beside the passageway, this one had no door at the passage’s location.  
I shook my head and spoke in a calm voice.  
“It’s fine. We didn’t live in that era, so it’s unreasonable to expect every detail to be deduced from a single record. Gigas was a bit of an outlier, but everything else is going as expected.”  
“Haha…”  
Shin Sang-yong gave an awkward smile at my gentle reassurance. Right now, the most critical thing to assess on this second floor was the level of the monsters. Sacrificing 100 humans could summon a single low-tier demon. The monsters on this floor varied in strength, but they were undoubtedly tougher than those on the first floor.  

“Hmm. Master.”  
“What?”  
“Like the leader said, if we sacrificed 100 monsters on Gigas’s level, what kind of demon could be summoned?”  
“Hm. That’s unlikely, isn’t it?”  
“Still.”  
At Shin Sang-yong’s insistence, Vivian paused, her face thoughtful. Shaking her head slightly, she answered cautiously.  
“Gigases are, as Su-hyeon said, like a mix of a giant and a basilisk. At that level, you could probably aim for a top-tier demon.”  
“Top-tier?”  
When I asked sharply, Vivian frantically waved her hands.  
“I-I don’t know! I mean, like you said, it’s not going to happen!”  
I snorted and turned away. Did she think “top-tier” was some dog’s name?  
From a user’s perspective, demons are categorized into low, mid, high, and top tiers for convenience, but the demon world has its own strict hierarchy. A top-tier demon would be at least a duke-level entity. Among our party, only I could realistically stand a chance against one. Vivian might be able to fight, but guaranteeing victory would be tough. She’d likely lose eight times out of ten.  
And even if one did appear…  

“I think it’s about time we explored this area.”  
I stood up, brushing off my clothes. I could sense a faint undercurrent of unease among the party. Hearing my words, Jeong Ha-yeon, who had been quietly meditating to regain her composure, opened her eyes and looked up at me.  
Perhaps due to overexertion, her already fair skin looked deathly pale. Normally, Jeong Ha-yeon would carefully ration her abilities, but since the Gigas fight, she’d been pushing herself to her limits in every battle.  
I had a rough idea why, so I didn’t say anything. These were issues we’d resolve once this expedition was over.  
After a brief rest, the party rose. I led them toward a door I’d chosen on instinct. Using my detection, I sensed activity from the western and northern rooms, but nothing from the eastern one.  
Since the first door I’d picked was in the western direction, we’d proceed clockwise.  

A heavy silence settled over the party as we walked. Fatigue was evident on their faces. But more than that, the looming threat of a demon battle with every room we cleared was likely causing subconscious tension.  
The lack of exploration rewards on this floor also contributed to the grim mood. Without a turning point to spark new energy, the battles would only weigh heavier on us. Sure, the items we’d obtained on the first floor were already a massive haul, but human greed knows no bounds.  
Finally, we stopped before a massive, imposing iron door.  
Just before opening it, I turned to face the party. Their dry, weary expressions met mine. I let out a quiet sigh, placed my hand on the door’s handle, and pulled with force. The grating screech of rusted metal echoed as I flung the door wide open.  
*“Groooar…”*  
The moment the door opened, a chilling gust sliced toward me.  
“Protect!”  
A translucent sphere enveloped me, and with a *thud*, the incoming sword aura dissipated. It was An-sol’s protection spell. I didn’t know when she’d prepared it, but I didn’t praise her. For a priest, this was expected—nothing more, nothing less.  
“There’s a monster. Everyone, be careful.”  
I raised my sword, bracing for another attack. But after the initial assault, nothing followed. We had no choice but to move forward.  
As I stepped inside, another wave of dark, shimmering sword aura surged toward me, as if it had been lying in wait. I was ready, swinging my sword to slice through it effortlessly before advancing further to secure a safe zone for the party.  
Once everyone had entered, I finally got a good look at the monster. This room was darker than the others, but not so pitch-black that we couldn’t see. The creature before us was…  
“A Spirit Knight.”  
At my words, Shin Sang-yong and Jeong Ha-yeon immediately frowned.  
“Ugh. This lab feels like a collection of magic-resistant monsters,” Jeong Ha-yeon muttered, her irritation evident.  
Two bent horns protruded from a helmet, within which a bluish flame flickered. The rusted armor was stained with dark, congealed blood. It was hard to see it as human anymore. Though most of its body was covered by armor, the glimpse of its face through the helmet was unmistakably a skull.  
A Spirit Knight was formidable not just for its physical attacks but for its ability to wield magic as well, making it a tricky opponent. Moreover, its mastery of mana granted it strong resistance to magic, which explained Jeong Ha-yeon’s frustration.  
As a former knight in life, it could handle close-quarters combat, cast magic, and resist magic. While it wasn’t a boss-level monster like a Death Knight, its well-rounded abilities made it far from an easy foe.  
However, those traits applied to a *true* Spirit Knight.  
“…Su-hyeon. Is this Spirit Knight another product of the lab?”  
“They’re summoning demons, so it’s not exactly surprising.”  
At my blunt response, Vivian furrowed her brow. I glanced at her briefly before turning away.  
“Toying with human souls… As an alchemist, I can’t forgive this.”  
Ignoring her muttering, I took another step forward. The knight, perhaps realizing its sword aura wouldn’t easily harm us, began slowly closing the distance.  
*“Groooar…”*  
“An-hyeon, Keeper, Yu-jeong—behind me. Sol, prepare a binding spell. Mages, support with auxiliary magic. And…”  
I paused briefly before continuing. Though I didn’t single anyone out, the only ones I hadn’t given orders to were the mages.  
“Don’t overdo it.”  
With that, I charged toward the Spirit Knight.
