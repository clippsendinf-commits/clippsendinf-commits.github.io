# Memorize - Chapter 34 (34/1068)

# Boss Monster

Three million gold points accumulated?

For a moment, I couldn’t grasp what she meant, but a memory of something Seraph had said before I returned to the past flashed through my mind.

“Please don’t misunderstand. User Kim Su-hyeon, you currently possess a considerable amount of points. Erasing them entirely would not be a rational decision.”

Could it be that there were still points left even after granting the special privileges? I wondered if I really had that many points, but it wasn’t entirely unbelievable. Despite achieving countless accomplishments in the latter half, I hadn’t paid any attention to gold points. I vaguely recalled receiving an enormous amount when I obtained the Zero Code. Regardless, this was an unexpected stroke of luck.

“Nice. Then pull up the user-exclusive shop catalog. You can do that from here, right?”

“Yes, I understand. However, there are still rewards left to be distributed.”

“What, more?”

At my question, Seraph nodded.

“The boss monster reward. I will distribute it immediately. Please check the messages for details.”

As soon as Seraph finished speaking, she lightly snapped her fingers. Instantly, a flood of messages appeared before my eyes.

『Great Achievement! You have defeated the Predator of the Rite of Passage, the boss monster that killed countless potential users. One achievement has been added.』

『You have been awarded 2 free stat points.』

『You have been awarded 50,000 user-exclusive gold points. User-exclusive gold points can be used in the Summoning Room or at user-exclusive shops in major cities.』

Holy crap.

The achievement and 50,000 points were one thing, but receiving free stat points was nothing short of a jackpot. The only way to gain stat points as an early mission reward was to graduate from the User Academy after three months, which granted 4 points. Beyond that, the methods I knew of were limited and time-consuming. This was a massive win. Considering that out of the 21 achievements I’d earned in the past, only one had granted stat points, I couldn’t help but grin as I looked at Seraph.

With her usual calm expression, Seraph displayed the user-exclusive shop catalog in front of me.

『User-Exclusive Shop』  
*Purchases can only be made with user-exclusive gold points.*  
『User Kim Su-hyeon’s Current Gold Points: 3,834,720 GP』  

* 1. Weapons (▽)  
* 2. Armor (▽)  
* 3. Accessories (▽)  
* 5. Other Equipment (▽)  
* 6. Potions (▽)  
* 7. Elixirs (▽)  
* 8. Scrolls (▽)  
* 9. Materials (▽)  
* 10. Wish (Required GP: 1,000,000 GP)  
* 11. Miscellaneous (▽)  

I was about to start browsing when I realized the item I was looking for wasn’t there. Then it hit me. I turned to Seraph and spoke up.

“I’ll pay 77,777 gold points to the shop for free. That’s the right amount, so show me all the hidden items.”

I’d once heard about a user who, by chance, spent exactly 77,777 GP and discovered a hidden secret. Known as the 77,777 GP Hidden Piece, it allows the user shop’s hidden equipment list to be revealed just once. The funny thing? That user didn’t have enough GP left to buy anything afterward, and those who exceeded that amount were in the same boat.

“…How did you know about that?”

“The boss monster begged for its life and spilled the beans.”

“Don’t lie. Executing it is no issue, but please refrain from reckless actions like with Hwajung this time.”

I chuckled and nodded. Seraph, however, gave me a skeptical glance before continuing.

“…77,777 GP has been deducted. The hidden list will be revealed just this once. User Kim Su-hyeon’s remaining GP is 3,756,943 points.”

Even as she spoke, Seraph’s face twitched slightly, but with a light wave of her hand, I saw the active list update. Without hesitation, I clicked on the Elixirs section. There might be something to boost my stamina.

As the list scrolled open, I calmly began browsing.

Oh, this exists? An elixir might be worth keeping on hand… but it’s 300,000 points. Hmm. Something that can raise the rank of special or potential abilities by one level… that’s not bad either. 500,000 points. Worth buying.

To other users, the GP costs would seem astronomical, but I was purchasing items without a second thought. If you’re not hoarding GP, it’s better to spend it right away. Opportunities like this were rare, so I planned to burn through as much GP as possible. However, I had no intention of buying a wish. Using a wish went against my principles, and besides, unless it was to revive a user, it was pretty much useless.

“Ha. An elixir that grants 6 stat points for 900,000 GP. Seraph, I want three of those.”

“That’s not possible. Items from the hidden list disappear from the catalog upon purchase. You can only buy one of each, except for potions, which allow multiple purchases.”

So, if I bought the stat-boosting elixir, no one else could ever buy it again. A bit disappointing, but the exclusivity was enough to make me compromise. After carefully browsing from items 1 to 11, I finalized my shopping list:

* Angel’s Tears (x1): Grants 6 new stat points, which can be allocated to any stat of the user’s choice. (900,000 GP)  
* Elixir (x2): Fully restores all status ailments, stamina, and mana. Can revive anyone who isn’t dead. (600,000 GP)  
* Arcane Elixir (x1) - Skill Point Boost: Raises the rank of a special or potential ability by one level, excluding unique abilities. (700,000 GP)  
* Stamina Boost Elixir (x1): Increases stamina stat points by 2. Cannot be used for other stats. (200,000 GP)  
* Formless Sword (x1): An invisible sword passed down from ancient times. Binds to the user. Exists in the spirit realm, making it invisible. Can strike beings in any dimension and, under certain conditions, summon its blade to the physical world. Boasts exceptional cutting power, near-unbreakable durability, and self-restoration. Capable of 100% magical attack and defense against all attributes. (1,200,000 GP)  
* Hall Plane Gold Conversion (10 GP = 1 Gold): 10,000 GP → 1,000 Gold  

『Total Purchase Cost: 3,610,000 GP. Purchases are non-refundable. Would you like to proceed?』  

“Yes.”

『Purchase completed. User Kim Su-hyeon’s remaining GP is 146,943. Items have been transferred to your user-exclusive storage, accessible from any minor city.』

Phew. After an exhilarating shopping spree, I looked up to see Seraph cradling her pretty face in her hands. I’d never seen her look so defeated, so I spoke with a wry expression.

“Seraph, you okay? Why do you look like you’re about to cry?”

“…User Kim Su-hyeon.”

“What?”

“Spending so much at once… I could let the others slide, but… the Formless Sword… *sigh*…”

I gave her a puzzled look as she let out heavy sighs. The reason I spent so much was obvious—opportunities like this don’t come twice. I could always earn more GP. I’d rightfully earned and inherited these points, so I bought what I wanted. I couldn’t fathom why she was making that face.

Sensing my gaze, Seraph composed herself and looked at me calmly.

“The Formless Sword… it appears unremarkable. There are plenty of weapons with flashy appearances and great abilities. Why choose it?”

“Obsessing over a sword’s appearance is for idiots, so I won’t bother explaining. Sure, it lacks fancy features, but an invisible sword gives me a huge combat advantage. Plus, it allows 100% magical attack and defense against all attributes. Paired with Hwajung, it’s unmatched. It’s durable, self-restoring—why? Getting worried now?”

At my teasing, Seraph gave a wistful smile and replied.

“Honestly, I’m a bit concerned. User Kim Su-hyeon, you’re strong. With all the equipment you’ve bought, you’d rank among the top-tier users who entered first, maybe even at the very top. But don’t get complacent. You may not realize it, but Hall Plane users are fiercely protective of their status. Some groups resort to extreme measures. You can’t do everything alone.”

Her words, *You can’t do everything alone*, pierced my chest. I instinctively bit my lip.

“I get what you mean. The nail that sticks out gets hammered. Don’t worry.”

“Good to know you understand.”

I glanced at Seraph’s face with a bored expression and continued.

“So, how much time is left?”

“You’ve been here just over two hours since passing the Rite of Passage. If you’d like, I can give you a general overview of Hall Plane.”

“No need.”

I decided to meditate instead. Meditation was for self-discipline, but once I started introspecting, time would fly by. Just as I was about to sit cross-legged and sink into my thoughts, Seraph’s beautiful voice hit my ears.

“User Kim Su-hyeon.”

“What?”

“I have one question.”

“Make it quick.”

Seraph gazed at me, unfazed by my curt tone, and slowly spoke.

“Do you dislike me?”

What’s she on about now? I opened my eyes again and looked at her, feeling uneasy. Why was she suddenly spouting nonsense? Sensing my confusion, she quickly added.

“I am a guide and assistant dedicated solely to you, User Kim Su-hyeon.”

“To me, you’re just a meddling angel who interferes too much.”

“In the Rite of Passage, you were reliable and composed, like a mature man. Is that your true self? Or is how you act with me the real you?”

I stared at her quietly for a moment. If I had to say, the way I was now was closer to the real me. In the Rite of Passage, I had to play a certain role. I could guess what she was curious about.

“…Humans are creatures with a thousand faces.”

Worried I might snap again, Seraph’s eyes widened slightly when I spoke in a softer tone.

“Please explain further.”

“It depends on the person. I’m kind to those who like me. Why bother being nice to those who don’t?”

At that, Seraph tilted her head and responded.

“That’s a very clear-cut way of thinking. I don’t dislike you, User Kim Su-hyeon. But you’ve never once looked at me with kindness.”

“Don’t draw lines so simply. Sometimes, people hope to be liked by those who dislike them. And the opposite can be true, too, right?”

One thing I liked about talking to Seraph was how straightforward our conversations were. She took my words at face value, analyzed them rationally, and responded. Nodding, she continued.

“I understand. I feel I’ve learned something valuable today.”

“What do you expect from someone who was kidnapped and used as a lab rat by you angels? Geez. Just don’t talk to me anymore.”

Seraph looked like she wanted to say more but ultimately closed her mouth. I cleared my mind and began meditating immediately.
