# Chapter 62: Mage and Alchemist (Rare)

<Flashback>  
“I won’t say I’m sorry. I had no choice but to do it.”  
“You’re not crazy.”  
“You still believe in me? Really? You trust me?”  
“If you really trust me… believe me… and take my spear. Please.”  
“Will you… die for me?”  

*  

An-sol was sobbing uncontrollably in my arms, tears streaming down her face. After hearing the whole story, An-hyeon was glaring at Yu-jeong with a face full of rage, as if he might swing his spear at her if I weren’t there. His lips twitched as if he wanted to say something, but he clamped his mouth shut and seethed instead.  

“Sol, I’m sorry. Oppa messed up. There, there, good girl. Stop crying now,” I said softly.  

“Sniff… sniff… Oppa… did you… really tell her to use me as bait?”  

Her words were broken by hiccups, but I could grasp what she meant. I immediately shook my head and told her I had no idea about it. Honestly, I had my suspicions, but since Yu-jeong hadn’t been fully upfront with me, I could deny it with a clear conscience.  

Hearing my response, An-sol seemed to calm down a bit, her sobs subsiding. Though she still hiccupped and sniffled, I figured she was okay enough to stop patting her head and tried to gently pull away. The moment I did, her face crumpled into a pout, so I hurriedly hugged her again and resumed stroking her hair. Her tear-streaked face, as she wiped her eyes, looked so pitiful it tugged at my heart.  

Yu-jeong was kneeling in front of An-sol, her hands raised in surrender. The sheer absurdity of her actions in the dungeon stirred a wave of frustration in me. I was getting swept up in the kids’ emotions, but An-hyeon’s anger was so intense that I chose to stay quiet for now.  

Yu-jeong hung her head, her expression wilted. Both An-hyeon and I were visibly upset, and the heavy atmosphere weighed on her. Normally, she’d be her cheeky, playful self, but in moments like this, she was as cautious as a scolded cat.  

“Go on, then. Explain yourself,” An-hyeon snapped, his voice sharp as a blade.  

Yu-jeong pouted briefly before retracting it. She glanced at An-sol, then spoke hesitantly.  

“Well… the thing is… I did it because…”  

“Sniff… sniff…”  

An-sol, still rubbing her face against my chest, was clearly overwhelmed with sadness. Seeing this, a spark of defiance flared in Yu-jeong’s eyes, but perhaps feeling the weight of her actions, she bit her lip and continued in a remorseful tone.  

“It’s just… Sol said she has good instincts, right? There were four tunnels, so… I thought maybe her instincts could tell the safe ones from the dangerous ones…”  

So that was the real reason she put An-sol in front of the tunnels. Hmm. It wasn’t entirely baseless, so I nodded thoughtfully, stroking my chin. But feeling An-sol squirming and whimpering in my arms, I went back to patting her back like I was soothing a baby. What was I even doing right now?  

Luck is the least understood stat among all abilities. All I knew was that it had a greater impact on magical effects than physical ones. There were a few other minor theories, but they were mostly unproven rumors.  

An-hyeon’s expression was conflicted, but he eventually nodded, seemingly convinced. He tapped Yu-jeong’s head lightly with the tip of his spear. It was probably annoying, but Yu-jeong didn’t protest.  

“Why didn’t you just say that from the start? Bait? Really? There are things you say and things you don’t. Hyung, say something to her too! You’re always so soft on Yu-jeong, spoiling her, and now she’s acting like this because of it!”  

“S-Sorry… what?”  

At An-hyeon’s words, both Yu-jeong and I stared at him, dumbfounded. What nonsense was he spouting? Yu-jeong looked equally aggrieved, her lips pursed as she tilted her head. But since she was clearly in the wrong, and An-sol was looking at me with those pleading, hopeful eyes, I found myself in an awkward spot.  

*  

After calming the chaos, we finally managed to move forward. An-sol’s eyes were red and puffy, Yu-jeong looked dejected, and An-hyeon was tight-lipped. I let out a low groan. Just when I thought we’d built some momentum, it all came crashing down.  

“Oh, this feels kind of promising,” I muttered.  

In the end, we chose the second tunnel. To test An-sol’s instincts, we had her stand in front of each of the four tunnels. The results were striking. At the first tunnel, she trembled violently. At the second, she tilted her head slightly, uncertain. At the third, she grimaced uncomfortably, and at the fourth, she bolted away immediately.  

With my Third Eye and detection skills giving me a rough sense of the situation, I couldn’t hide my astonishment. For a priest, magic power is crucial, but I wondered if investing just one point in Luck might be worth it. Seeing An-sol’s 100 Luck points produce effects somewhat similar to my Third Eye made the idea oddly tempting.  

Perhaps hearing my unspoken praise, An-sol straightened up proudly as she walked beside me. Her slender neck stretched tall, but with her swollen eyes, she looked comical despite her effort to appear dignified.  

I walked calmly, scanning our surroundings with my detection. Based on my gut, we were due for another monster encounter soon. Sure enough, I sensed something. When I stopped, the kids flinched, their faces tensing. Every time I paused, it usually meant a fight was coming, so their wariness was natural.  

“We should be careful from here on out,” I said, my tone cryptic.  

The kids’ faces hardened in response. I sensed two types of monsters ahead, but only three in total: one living creature and two statues. Guessing what we were up against, I decided to warn them before they got confused. As I resumed walking, I glanced at An-sol, who still seemed a bit smug, and spoke gently.  

“Sol.”  

“Yes?”  

Her anger toward me seemed to have melted away, her voice returning to its usual soft lilt. She smiled brightly at me, and just as I was about to continue, sweat beading on my forehead—  

“Help! Please, save me!”  

A frail, desperate voice echoed through the air, making me frown. Just as I was about to explain, the creature had beaten me to it. As expected, the voice came from deeper inside, and An-hyeon and Yu-jeong’s expressions shifted dramatically.  

“Hyung, it sounds like those other users the guy we met earlier mentioned,” An-hyeon said.  

“It’s probably someone kidnapped around here…” Yu-jeong added.  

“Enough. I’m talking,” I cut in sternly, silencing them.  

Their anxious faces showed their frustration at my hesitation to rush in and help. I clicked my tongue, about to speak again, when—  

“Is anyone there? Please, I’m begging you! Save me!”  

The voice came again, and I could tell it was a cunning creature. My irritation, already simmering from the time wasted at the tunnels, flared up. I wasn’t entirely blameless, so I’d been holding back, not wanting to take it out on the kids. But this was pushing me over the edge, and I could feel my old temperament creeping back.  

I drew my sword, swung it lightly forward, and sheathed it again. The motion was subtle, infused with mana, sending a sword wave too faint for the kids to notice. If the creature was intelligent, it would take the hint to shut up.  

“Save m—Kieee!”  

Confirming that my sword wave had sliced through the creature’s right arm, I let out a sigh. The kids looked bewildered, likely catching on to something odd from the horrific screech that followed.  

“Ahem. Let’s try this again. Sol, do you know anything about a monster called Ramik?”  

“Uh… Ramik?” An-sol murmured, lost in thought.  

She seemed to struggle, as Ramik wasn’t a major monster. But an unexpected voice chimed in. Yu-jeong, who had been sulking and fiddling with her dagger, cautiously raised her hand.  

“Oppa, isn’t Ramik a variant of a doppelgänger?”  

“Hm?”  

I looked at her, surprised. Encouraged by my nod to continue, she spoke in a low voice.  

“I heard it can mimic voices, though it can’t perfectly copy appearances or sustain transformations like a doppelgänger. It’s not physically strong, but that’s relative to experienced users. New users need to be cautious. It often sets traps and manipulates emotions to lure people in, so you should never rush in recklessly…”  

“Exactly. How’d you know that? Ramik isn’t something they cover in detail,” I said, impressed.  

Yu-jeong stuck out her tongue playfully. “Just heard it by chance.”  

I gave her an approving look, while An-sol pouted and muttered, “I knew that too…” An-hyeon shook his head, stunned, then turned to me.  

“Hyung, are you saying that voice just now was a Ramik?”  

“Yup. It probably devoured a user’s vocal cords and is mimicking their voice.”  

As expected, An-hyeon was the quickest to piece things together. If only he had a bit more foundational knowledge, he’d be perfect. As I sighed inwardly, he suddenly pointed his spear at Yu-jeong. My eyes flashed with anger before I could stop myself.  

*Clang!*  

*Ping! Thud!*  

With lightning speed, I drew my sword and struck An-hyeon’s spear, knocking it from his hands. It spun wildly through the air and crashed into a corner. The kids froze, mouths agape, stunned by the suddenness of it all.  

An-hyeon, in particular, looked shocked. He glanced between me and his spear, then stammered, “H-Hyung, I was just joking…”  

“Joking about what?”  

“I… I thought maybe Yu-jeong was a Ramik…”  

Normally, Yu-jeong would’ve snapped back, but my icy demeanor silenced her. The frustration I’d been suppressing since the Black Forest finally boiled over. Pointing a weapon at an ally, whether intentional or not, was a deep trigger for me—one of my worst pet peeves.  

“An-hyeon, An-sol, Yu-jeong. Are you all here to play around? Is this what you want to do?”  

“…”  

My rebuke left them speechless, like mute statues. But I didn’t stop.  

“You think I’m a pushover because I laugh and let things slide? There’s a time and place for everything. How long are you going to act so carefree? And An-hyeon, joking? You point a spear at Yu-jeong as a *joke*? If even you’re acting like this, what am I supposed to do?”  

“Oppa, it’s fine! I did the same to Sol. I’m not mad, so please calm down, okay? Oppa~” Yu-jeong tried to defuse with clumsy charm, while An-hyeon bowed his head and muttered, “I’m sorry, Hyung.”  

But my anger didn’t subside. Playfulness was fine in moderation, but this was too much. Since the battle with the Rengas, the kids’ attitudes had grown lax. The deeper we went into a dungeon, the more vigilant they should be, yet they were doing the opposite.  

They should’ve remembered my warnings from the Black Forest and realized how reckless they’d been. I’d never heard of a caravan this careless, and even if one existed, I couldn’t fathom it. In a cold voice, I addressed An-hyeon directly.  

“What you did to Sol was excessive, but it had some logic and was within acceptable bounds, so I let it slide. But pointing a weapon at an ally in a dungeon, in the middle of a real battle? You call that a joke? Should I try the same ‘joke’ on you?”  

An-hyeon, who’d once felt the weight of my presence back at the inn, waved his hands frantically, his face pale with remorse. He seemed to vaguely grasp what I was getting at.  

A tense silence followed, but I gave a curt nod. An-hyeon hung his head and retrieved his spear. An-sol, watching the scene, swallowed hard and gripped her staff tightly.  

After glaring at the three of them with disappointment, I let out a heavy sigh and spoke again.
