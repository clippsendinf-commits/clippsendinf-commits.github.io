# Chapter 86: Sweeping Through a Thousand Miles

Perhaps we had already entered the Ruined Laboratory the moment we stepped through the entrance. However, looking around, it was hard to tell whether we were still in the forest or standing before the laboratory. It seemed the building had been constructed with care to avoid damaging the natural surroundings, blending seamlessly into the environment. Because of this, the Ruined Laboratory felt somewhat like a natural fortress.

Ahead, a heavy iron door stood firmly shut. Without a word, the group, as if entranced, began walking toward it. The door, visibly massive even at a glance, groaned as I pushed it open, flakes of rust falling with a soft clatter. A grating, unpleasant screech echoed as the door opened just enough for one person to slip through. I stepped inside.

And then, the others who followed me froze, their breaths catching at the sight before them.

“Is the light magic… still active?” 

“It’s not perfect,” Jeong Ha-yeon explained. “The flickering suggests it’s almost at the end of its lifespan. But, Su-hyeon-ssi…”

Her additional remarks snapped me back to attention, and I focused on the scene ahead. A wide, white corridor stretched out, reminiscent of a hospital hallway. Faintly glowing light stones lined the walls, though their dim illumination betrayed the passage of time. The entire structure was heavily weathered, exuding decay. A chilling air lingered, causing the others to shiver and draw closer to me.

That’s when it happened.

“Sob… sob…”

A faint voice reached us. It came from a distance, but there was no mistaking it—it was human. The group fell silent, the corridor eerily still. The others’ faces stiffened; I wasn’t the only one who heard it.

“Oppa, could it be like last time…?” Yu-jeong’s voice trembled with unease.

I shook my head. It wasn’t a Ramik. Extending my senses forward, I detected a humanoid figure, but something about it felt subtly off—too strange to be human.

After a moment of hesitation, I decided to move forward. Standing here indefinitely wasn’t an option, and getting closer might provide answers. I felt someone clutching the hem of my clothes from behind, but I took the lead and began advancing slowly.

“Sob… sob…”

The corridor seemed endless—a single long passage encased in rusted, decrepit walls. As we pressed forward, the faint voice grew clearer.

“Sob… sob… You’ve come?”

The words became distinguishable as we closed the distance. A sobbing voice, saying, “You’ve come.” But the tone carried no welcome—only unmistakable hostility.

A little closer. Just a little more.

Even without my prompting, the group was visibly tense. They had drawn their weapons, eyes fixed ahead, clearly shaken. This was psychological fear, not the tangible dread of physical danger but the kind that gnawed at the mind, like a scene from a horror movie they might have watched back on Earth. Their bodies instinctively recoiled.

I was the exception. Having plummeted to the depths of hell in my first cycle, I found most ghosts or grotesque monsters almost charming by comparison. Recalling those days in hell sent a shiver down my spine, but even that memory didn’t faze me much. Still, my reaction seemed to heighten the group’s anxiety, perhaps due to a misunderstanding. Nonetheless, I steadily closed the distance to the source of the voice.

Finally, we caught a faint glimpse of the figure making the sound. Though still some distance away, under the flickering light stones, we could see a single humanoid form kneeling demurely. At the same moment, I felt someone tightly embrace me from behind.

“Sol-ah?”

“Don’t… go…” An-sol’s voice quivered.

“An-sol, calm down.”

An-hyeon quickly stepped in to soothe her, but her trembling only worsened. This wasn’t mere whining—she was on the verge of a breakdown. I swiftly placed my hand on her head and channeled my magic.

“Ah…”

As my magic seeped into her, I felt her rigid, frozen mana. I gently coaxed and warmed it, calming her bit by bit. Slowly, her pale cheeks regained a hint of color. Though she still clung to me, unwilling to let go, the fear in her seemed to lessen. Savoring the flow of my mana, she spoke in a halting voice.

“Such immense malice… It’s… blind, overwhelming…”

Her words caused the group to frown, struggling to make sense of them. An-sol seemed desperate to explain but couldn’t find the words. Jeong Ha-yeon, however, was an exception.

“I feel it too,” she said. “Mages and priests are sensitive to the flow of souls or minds. That figure up there—it’s radiating intense resentment. Honestly, it’s chilling even for me.”

An-sol nodded frantically as Jeong Ha-yeon elaborated. Shin Sang-yong mirrored her reaction. An-hyeon, though confused, seemed to sense something unsettling, his steps hesitant. I spoke lightly to ease their tension.

“It’s just a monster in the Hall Plane. We have no choice but to move forward. Don’t be afraid—let’s get closer.”

“Oppa…” Yu-jeong and An-sol pleaded with their eyes.

But seeing my resolute expression, they relented, drawing their weapons. As An-sol’s arms fell away, we resumed our advance. The closer we got to the figure, the clearer its voice and form became.

The figure appeared human at first glance, draped in a tattered, faded white gown. Long, disheveled hair spilled over its shoulders as it knelt, facing away from us, showing only the back of its head.

When we drew near, the sobbing abruptly ceased, replaced by an icy silence that settled between us and the figure.

The group held their breath, staring at its back. I stepped forward and spoke in a calm voice.

“Are you someone connected to this laboratory?”

No response. I rested my hand on my sword and signaled the others with my eyes. Then, the figure’s voice cut through the air, reaching my ears.

“How… did you get here?”

The grating voice halted us just before combat. Someone behind me swallowed hard. Keeping my composure, I responded.

“We stumbled upon this place by chance. If you can speak, we’d appreciate answers to our questions. Who are you?”

“How… did you get here?”

“If you keep dodging my questions, we’ll consider you a clear enemy and act accordingly. This is your last chance. What’s your connection to this laboratory?”

The figure didn’t answer my warning. A heavy silence followed, thick with unease. Then…

“This place…”

*Crack!* The figure’s neck twisted sharply.

“How…”

*Crack!* Its neck bent further, almost halfway.

“Did you get here?”

*Crunch!* With a final wrenching sound, the figure’s neck turned a full 180 degrees. Its body remained kneeling forward, but its head now faced us. At last, we saw its face clearly.

Sunken eyes, a collapsed nose, and a toothless, gaping mouth—it was the epitome of a ghost. Unmistakable malice oozed from its expression.

“Kyaaaah!” An-sol screamed, unable to contain herself.

Yu-jeong quickly covered her mouth, but the group’s breathing grew ragged, their shock evident. The figure, as if savoring our fear, tilted its head slowly, its hollow eyes curving into crescents as it opened its mouth again.

“Ehehe! How did you get here? Ehehe! Ehehehe!”

“Su-hyeon-ssi!”

The figure’s maniacal laughter sent some of the group into a panic, overwhelmed by psychological terror. As Jeong Ha-yeon’s urgent cry rang out, the flickering light stones began to strobe even more erratically.

Pitch-black darkness alternated with flashes of light, illuminating the corridor intermittently. In sync with the flickering, the figure began to move. Each flash revealed it standing, limbs dangling, then lurching toward us, its motions jerky like a slideshow.

As it lunged at me with its gaping mouth, I thrust out my right hand. Something sharp grazed my palm—not human teeth, but something closer to an animal’s. Without hesitation, I gripped it tightly and yanked with all my strength.

“Gah! Grrrrr!”

“Light!”

The moment I felt something tear in my grasp, Jeong Ha-yeon’s light magic flared, flooding the corridor with steady illumination. I let out a breath. Turning, I saw the others poised to rush to my aid, weapons drawn.

“What, planning to betray me?” I joked, trying to lighten the tense atmosphere.

“N-no! That ghost was definitely going for you, hyung…” An-hyeon stammered, turning to look at my hand. His face froze in shock.

I gave a faint smirk and tossed the thing to the ground. A jawbone rolled across the floor, stopping at the figure, which now writhed in pain, clutching its mouth.

Shrugging at the stunned group, I crouched beside the figure. It had charged so dramatically, but now it was just a pathetic monster. Sure, I’d used a bit more force than necessary for scaring our precious group, but I felt no guilt.

Wiping my bloodied hand on its gown, I examined it closely. It was grotesque, but compared to the horrors of hell, it was almost tame.

“Shhh…”

A weak, pitiful sound escaped it, but I ignored it. I only wanted one thing: information. Grasping its long hair, I lifted its head. The ghost-like monster’s face came up limply, and I gave it a faint smile.
