# Chapter 104: Don’t Mess with My Oppa

The gentle atmosphere that had been lingering between me and Jeong Ha-yeon vanished the moment the kids and Shin Sang-yong entered the room. It was as if nothing had happened in the first place. I admired her ability to clearly separate personal and professional matters, but for now, I had to deal with the immediate issue at hand.

The kids, upon seeing me up and about after entering the room, initially showed relief. When they asked about my health, I responded with a smile, assuring them I was fine. But that moment of ease was short-lived.

Before long, the kids had surrounded me, their faces tinged with awkwardness. They weren’t fools. The abilities I’d displayed against the demons clearly exceeded the standards they’d set for themselves. These were not the capabilities of a typical zero-year user.

A meaningless silence stretched on for a while, but as expected, the first to break it was the female user, Jeong Ha-yeon. I mentally gauged how much I should reveal as I waited for her question.

“Don’t you have something to say to your party?”

At her question, I closed my eyes and deliberated. I didn’t want to give vague answers. I had planned to reveal most of it after this expedition anyway, so I wasn’t particularly burdened, but there was a limit. The fact that I had seen the end of the Hall Plane, obtained the Zero Code, and returned for some reason—these were things I could never disclose.

Having made up my mind to an extent, I opened my eyes to find the kids watching me with anxious expressions. After a brief pause, I spoke in a low voice.

“I do.”

“Then say it.”

I tilted my head slightly, feeling a bit exasperated by her demand to just start talking without context. What exactly was I supposed to say first? Shaking my head with a wry expression, I responded.

“It’s not something I can answer so broadly.”

At my words, Jeong Ha-yeon’s brow furrowed slightly. She fell silent, seemingly mulling over my response, before continuing in a cool tone.

“Broadly, you say. So you’re admitting there’s more than one or two things you’re hiding.”

“I suppose so.”

I acknowledged it readily. In that moment, I could see the party members exchanging bewildered glances. However, I maintained a calm demeanor. Showing hesitation in a situation like this could give the impression that I was admitting fault. Acting confidently would be more effective in conveying my stance.

Jeong Ha-yeon closed her eyes upon hearing my response and continued speaking with them shut.

“I don’t know your intentions. I don’t know your reasons either. But frankly, I’m not feeling great about this.”

“…”

“Let me be honest about how I feel. When I first met you, I had a strong favorable impression of you, user Kim Su-hyeon. But now, I’m not so sure. Still… I want to hold on to that favorable impression. That’s my honest feeling.”

“I feel the same.”

At my response, Jeong Ha-yeon softened her expression slightly and spoke in her usual clear voice.

“If you truly feel that way, then tell us. No—I’ll ask you questions. I want you to answer every single one without a shred of falsehood.”

“Every user has one or two secrets they keep.”

At my indirect refusal, her eyes flashed sharply once more.

“That’s different. Right now, I’m honestly doubting whether you’re even a zero-year user, or frankly, whether you’re even human.”

“Fine. Even if I answer now, can you truly believe everything I say is the truth?”

“I have my ways. You just said ‘fine,’ didn’t you? Then I’ll take it as you agreeing to my request.”

Having finished speaking, Jeong Ha-yeon reached into her bosom. The conversation was gradually getting on track. The rest of the party seemed to sense the shift in atmosphere, swallowing hard. Soon, she pulled out a small, round crystal orb and placed it in front of me. The moment I recognized what it was, I nearly let my expression falter.

“I didn’t think I’d use this here. I’m sorry. But to be honest, I want to hold on to my expectations for you, and I can’t let go of my lingering feelings. So please forgive me for using the <Crystal of Truth>.”

Seeing the Crystal of Truth, I let out a soft groan. It was a fairly rare item. In my ten years in the Hall Plane, I’d seen the Crystal of Truth used fewer than a hundred times. As everyone’s attention turned to the orb, she held it out toward me and explained.

“I obtained it by chance a year ago. When you place your hand on the <Crystal of Truth> and infuse it with mana, it synchronizes with the user’s inner self. That inner self is converted into a kind of frequency and displayed on the orb. This frequency connects to the user’s voice, allowing it to distinguish truth from lies.”

“Must we resort to this method…”

Despite my trailing words and displeased expression, her face remained unshaken. Still, I could somewhat understand her feelings. That item was incredibly expensive, practically a user’s lifeline. When I rescued her before, I hadn’t seen it, so she must have kept it well-hidden. For her to bring it out now, sacrificing such a valuable asset, meant she had made a significant decision. It was proof that she held some expectations for me. This was a hurdle I’d have to face eventually, but it felt like a bigger deal than I’d anticipated. Still, there was no avoiding it.

As I let out a heavy sigh and reached for the Crystal of Truth, a voice interrupted.

“Unnie, stop it.”

Just as I extended my hand to place it on the crystal, a slender hand shot out from my right and grabbed mine. The owner of that hand was none other than Lee Yu-jeong.

“Yu-jeong, stay out of this.”

“No, you stay out of it, unnie.”

Despite Ha-yeon’s gentle admonishment, Yu-jeong stood her ground. Their gazes clashed fiercely in the air. Given how close they usually were, Yu-jeong’s behavior was quite unexpected.

“This is something necessary for me and for all of us.”

“Who are you to step in like this?”

“…”

At Yu-jeong’s sharp retort, Jeong Ha-yeon visibly grimaced. But Yu-jeong was no pushover either. With fiery eyes, rarely seen in front of me, she stared directly at her usually friendly unnie. Though Jeong Ha-yeon openly showed her displeasure, Yu-jeong paid no heed and pressed on.

“Frankly, you and user Shin Sang-yong haven’t been with oppa for long. We’re different. Completely different. We’ve eaten together, slept together, and acted together from the start. I don’t know how oppa feels about you cornering him like this, but it’s really pissing me off.”

I’d been sensing something off about Yu-jeong, and now I realized what it was. Normally, she spoke casually, throwing around “hyung” and “unnie,” but this time, she was using formal speech from the start. Jeong Ha-yeon seemed to pick up on it too, responding in a low, subdued voice.

“You’re still young. Or maybe you haven’t grasped what kind of place the Hall Plane is. This is a place where people deceive and are deceived. If there’s even a hint of something suspicious, you confirm it and move on. That’s the creed that’s kept me alive. Shall I be blunt? Strictly speaking, the user Kim Su-hyeon, whom you trust and follow, has been deceiving you all this time—”

“Don’t talk recklessly!”

Yu-jeong’s loud shout cut Jeong Ha-yeon off. Trembling with genuine anger, Yu-jeong shot back in a sharp tone.

“Fine, I don’t know much. But I’m confident I know oppa better than you do.”

“You…”

“My point isn’t finished. Oppa deceived us? Deceived us how? He’s sacrificed for us, not tricked us. Even if he did hide something, it’s not deception. He must have had his reasons.”

Jeong Ha-yeon wasn’t backing down entirely either. Her usual composed expression was gone, and she was biting her lip, anger visibly rising.

“Sure, you might think that way. But have you considered it could just be your delusion? Do the others think as casually as you do?”

“What?”

Yu-jeong’s eyes widened as she turned to An-hyeon and An-sol.

“Hey, An-hyeon, An-sol. Say something. Do you also think oppa deceived us?”

At her question, An-hyeon and An-sol, looking flustered, only exchanged glances without responding immediately. Seeing their hesitation, Yu-jeong let out a scoffing “Ha.” Jeong Ha-yeon, watching her, spoke in a low voice.

“Deception doesn’t always have a negative connotation. Fine, maybe I don’t have the right to press Su-hyeon like this. But even if I don’t, you do. You have the right to know. Yet, as you said, because you’ve been with him from the start, you’re too reliant on him, too trusting. That’s why I’m speaking up on your behalf. And I also believe in him… ugh, never mind.”

She opened her mouth as if to say more but closed it again. An-hyeon and An-sol still looked confused, while Shin Sang-yong simply closed his eyes. Vivian, meanwhile, was glaring at Jeong Ha-yeon with sharp eyes.

Most would have backed off by now, but Yu-jeong was Yu-jeong. With a look of disbelief and exasperation, she rolled her eyes. Unable to find the right words, the sound of her grinding her teeth echoed. Soon, her fiery gaze landed on An-hyeon and An-sol.

“You’re just sitting there listening? Aren’t you angry? Don’t you feel frustrated?”

“Yu-jeong, calm down. It’s not that we don’t trust hyung. Let’s just hear him out. Listening won’t hurt.”

“Y-Yeah… I believe in oraboni too.”

An-hyeon and An-sol stammered their responses, but it only fueled Yu-jeong’s anger further.

“Calm down? Calm down?! Ugh, this is ridiculous.”

“…”

Frustrated, Yu-jeong choked up, breathing heavily as if her throat was blocked. An-sol, concerned, tried to soothe her, but Yu-jeong shook her off forcefully. Then, in a loud voice, she unleashed a torrent of pent-up frustration.

“You and Sol don’t even think about how much we’ve benefited from oppa since the Rite of Passage.”

Her piercing words made An-sol lower her head. An-hyeon, trying to stay calm, spoke in a measured tone.

“It’s not like that… Let’s just talk it out…”

“Talk? What’s there to talk about? Who was it that lured those zombie bastards and got us out of the forest? Who saved us when we were about to be crushed by the boss monster? Who bought us time to escape? Who turned down a lucrative offer from the high-and-mighty Golden Lion Clan to stick with us?!”

Yu-jeong’s shouts silenced the room. But she wasn’t done. After catching her breath, she continued.

“Who always fought monsters at the forefront to protect us? Who bought us new gear every time while using a worn-out sword and tattered clothes himself? Who ran around tirelessly while we trained comfortably and rested? It was oppa. Su-hyeon oppa.”

An-hyeon and An-sol stared at Yu-jeong, dumbfounded. Her voice seemed to carry a hint of tears. Seeing her like this, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of admiration. I hadn’t realized she thought so highly of me.

I hadn’t known she cared for me this much, but An-hyeon and An-sol were no different. They were silent not because they doubted me but because they were curious and wanted to hear my side. In that sense, Yu-jeong might be overreacting a bit. Still, given her personality and our time together, her behavior wasn’t entirely surprising. Though it was a bit embarrassing, I couldn’t help but feel warmed by her fierce defense.

After Yu-jeong’s outburst, a heavy silence settled over the group. But soon, she turned back to Jeong Ha-yeon.

“You’re no different, unnie. If it weren’t for oppa, you and user Shin Sang-yong wouldn’t have been rescued. How can you do this? What did oppa do wrong? Isn’t it enough that things turned out well? He was just trying to protect us…”

As she spoke, Yu-jeong’s gaze flicked to the Crystal of Truth.

“That’s…”

Jeong Ha-yeon’s face briefly showed a flicker of unease. She was momentarily overwhelmed by Yu-jeong’s fierce momentum. Impressed by Yu-jeong’s unexpected stand, I nodded inwardly. She hadn’t planned this strategically, but the atmosphere was favorable.

Since she’d laid the groundwork, it was time for me to step in. I had intended to reveal some truths anyway, so I needed to share a certain amount. Staring at the Crystal of Truth, I mentally ran through various scenarios.

At the same time, I activated my Third Eye.
