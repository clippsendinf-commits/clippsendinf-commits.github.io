# Memorize - Chapter 32 (32/1068): Boss Monster

Facing the boss monster charging with its grotesque teeth bared as if to devour me, I aimed my left arm at its upper body. I could fire three arrows in quick succession, each infused with sharp magical energy capable of piercing even ordinary steel.  
I took aim and released.  
*Paang! Paang! Paang!*  
The arrows sliced through the air with a much louder whoosh than before. Though there was a slight delay between them, I saw each one hit the center of the monster’s forehead precisely. But…  
*Clang! Clang! Clang!*  
The arrows I fired struck with a harsh metallic sound and fell uselessly to the ground. They couldn’t penetrate the boss monster’s outer hide. Still, they weren’t entirely ineffective. The monster flinched momentarily, likely feeling the shockwave of magical energy projected inward.  
Even with just a small amount of magic, the arrows carried twice the power of normal ones, yet the creature withstood them with its hide alone. I couldn’t help but wonder what kind of twisted minds the angels had to place such a beast in the Rite of Passage. Still, I’d achieved my immediate goal: I’d clearly succeeded in slowing the monster’s accelerating pursuit.  
The boss monster was staggering, its body shrinking further as if reeling from the impact. I decided to grill Seraph about this later and turned to catch up with my party.  
Looking ahead, I saw them running hard. Judging by the distance they’d covered, they’d soon be within 100 meters of safety. That was close enough for me to consider them secure, even if it was a bit dicey for me.  
As I picked up speed, a strange feeling crept over me. The monster hadn’t been heavily injured, and it should’ve had plenty of time to recover from the shock, yet I couldn’t hear the sound of it charging. No thundering *thud-thud* of its steps. Suddenly, I recalled its crouched stance and the way the mangis had leaped at me in yesterday’s battle. A sinking realization hit me, and in that instant, I heard the sound of wind surging from behind.  
*Whooosh!*  
My worst suspicion became reality. This boss monster was cunning and calculating. It knew it wouldn’t catch anyone if it kept up its current pace. Its crouch wasn’t a reaction to my arrows—it was preparing for a massive leap.  
A huge shadow loomed over the clearing, engulfing me. The boss monster had leaped past me, its eyes fixed on the party running ahead. An-hyeon was in the lead, with Han-byeol and Yu-jeong close behind. An-sol was struggling, trailing at the rear due to her lower stamina. While the others were likely safe, An-sol was at a dangerous distance.  
Before I could shout a warning, the boss monster arced through the air and landed heavily behind An-hyeon’s group, shaking the ground with a tremendous roar. The impact was so great that even An-hyeon, running ahead, stumbled. My mind went blank at the sight, devoid of thought.  
Then, a message appeared before my eyes:  
*[Potential Ability: Mind’s Eye (True) (Rank A+) activates. This is not merely seeing the outward form but gazing into the essence of a target. It allows self-reflection, observation of all things, or detection of phenomena with similar effects. A mind honed to its limits can maintain composure even under S-rank or lower mental corruption magic.]*  
…  
…  
…  
*“Hoo…”*  
My overheated mind cooled instantly. The blank, thoughtless haze gave way to cold, clear reason. My narrow focus expanded, and details I hadn’t noticed before came into view.  
And then, I laughed. I couldn’t help it.  
What had I been so worried about? This situation, of all things? I’d faced far worse, far more painful, far more perilous moments before.  
There was no fear, no dread. I wouldn’t overexert myself. I always drew a line and did my best within it. That was my creed when I played through the Hall Plane the first time.  
In the Hall Plane, half-baked strength doesn’t cut it. I’d seen countless people with exceptional talent and ability die before they could fully bloom. Vowing never to reveal my true strength, I lived in the shadows, hiding the fact that I was a Sword Master with a mere 48 magic points. Over ten years in the Hall Plane, that cautious approach became an obsession.  
I still believed that mindset was necessary at times. But repeating the same approach would only yield the same results.  
When I failed to protect my older brother, when I lost the clan lord I trusted, followed, and loved right before my eyes, I was consumed by regret. I didn’t want to walk that path again. I’d returned to change my fate, hadn’t I? I wanted to be different now.  
In an instant, I analyzed the battlefield and calculated the optimal course of action. I gauged the precise amount of magic needed and devised the most efficient strategy. No longer would I hide myself to the point of frustration. If it was necessary, I’d act. Sure, getting caught could be troublesome, but the solution was simple: don’t get caught. I had the ability and confidence to pull it off.  
In less than a second, I finished my analysis. I confirmed An-sol’s position and her survival status. The first priority was drawing the boss monster’s aggro. Its massive body conveniently blocked me from the party’s view. I channeled a surge of magic, infusing my arrows with enough power to pierce its hide. No need to feign aiming—I pulled the bowstring and fired.  
*Ping! Ping! Ping!*  
The monster, startled by the intense killing intent from behind, whipped its head around. But the arrows, moving at a speed far beyond my earlier shots, gave it no time to react. All three slammed into its chest. And there was more to come.  
*Boom! Boom! Boom!*  
The magic-infused arrows exploded like bombs, shattering the monster’s hide with ease. The effect was immediate.  
*Kraraaaa!*  
Hurts, doesn’t it? It should. As the boss monster let out a pained scream, I sprinted toward it. Through the Third Eye, I saw An-hyeon, Han-byeol, and Yu-jeong stumbling but still running. They hadn’t noticed An-sol falling behind. Good. This worked in my favor…  
Wait. An-hyeon stopped.  
“Sol! Sol! Answer me, Sol!”  
He must’ve just realized An-sol was missing, his voice desperate. I mentally cursed him for being an idiot and sped up. The distance between me and the monster closed rapidly. The creature, still bellowing, noticed me approaching and raised its massive right hand high, trembling with rage.  
I’d deliberately kept the arrows’ power low to avoid killing it, but it didn’t appreciate the gesture. It swung its hand down at me, its gleaming claws slicing through the air like a reaper’s scythe. To an ordinary person, it’d be terrifying, but to me, it was laughably slow.  
I kicked off the ground, accelerating further, then bent my lower body to slide parallel to the earth. The monster’s claws grazed past my face, cutting a few strands of hair that fluttered into the air. But I cleanly dodged the attack, sliding inside its reach. There, I saw An-sol, coughing and propped up on her hands.  
*“Cough! Cough!”*  
The air was thick with dust, likely from the monster’s landing. In the past, I might’ve comforted An-sol to calm her, but there was no time or inclination for that now. I swiftly scooped her up in a princess carry. She flinched, clearly not expecting me, then spoke in a trembling voice.  
“S-Su-hyeon oppa…?”  
“Quiet. Let’s get away from this thing first.”  
I finished speaking, then fired three more arrows I’d nocked while running. Without checking the results, I plowed through the dust and sprinted. The monster’s pitiful scream echoed again, suggesting another hit had landed somewhere painful.  
An-sol’s expression was a sight to behold. Tears welled in her eyes as she gazed up at me, as if I were her savior. An-hyeon, who had shaken off Yu-jeong and Han-byeol’s attempts to hold him back and was turning to come back, froze with his mouth agape when he saw me emerge from the dust.  
Funnily enough, his expression shifted rapidly: blank shock, then relief, and finally near tears. Seeing a guy act like that made my stomach churn.  
It felt like the siblings were about to throw a crying party. Muttering to myself about their dramatics, I kept running.  
Just then, Han-byeol shouted something urgently, and a chill ran down my spine. As expected, the boss monster wasn’t letting us go easily. Its tail whipped toward my back like a lash. If it hit, I could withstand it, but An-sol wouldn’t survive the shock passing through me.  
Suddenly, I wanted to take this thing down. No one had ever defeated a Hall Plane boss monster. It could count as an achievement, maybe even earn a reward. Beyond that, as a user, I simply wanted to beat it. To do that, I needed to separate from An-hyeon’s group for a bit. I decided to take the hit.  
The tail struck my back with a loud *thud*, sending a massive shock through me. It didn’t hurt, but the force would naturally send me flying. The impact wasn’t something to shrug off.  
I channeled magic to absorb the shock into my body. Drawing on the principle of “four ounces to move a thousand pounds,” I adjusted the technique to suit my needs, dispersing the incoming force throughout my body. Normally used to mitigate overwhelming impacts, I’d adapted it for this purpose before.  
I let just enough shock pass through to An-sol to make her withstandable, then hurled her forward. I redirected the remaining force sideways and rolled my body dramatically. Just before we were flung apart, I whispered in her ear:  
“Get up and run to the warp gate.”  
Before she could respond, our bodies were launched. I went left, and she flew toward the party. Whether it was her uselessly high Luck stat kicking in, An-sol landed perfectly in An-hyeon’s arms.  
I hit the ground and rolled but got up immediately. This boss monster was on a different level from the typical Rite of Passage creatures. It recognized me as a threat and didn’t let up after landing a hit. Instead, it leaped toward me, radiating thick killing intent. I’d definitely pulled its aggro.  
*Kaboom!*  
The ground shook again with a sound like a cannon shot. I dodged, but my body was rattled by the impact. The monster, enraged that I’d evaded, stomped repeatedly at my position.  
*Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!*  
*Eek. Ack. Eek. Ack.*  
Here we go.  
“Oppa!”  
“Hyeeeong!”  
I wanted to yell back, “What?!” but I barely held my tongue to maintain my stoic older-brother image. Normally, I’d have waved and smiled to show I was fine, but not now. I gestured for them to flee, but the party didn’t budge. Finally, I shouted at the top of my lungs.  
“Run, you idiots! Get to the warp gate!”  
After a brief commotion, I saw An-hyeon forcibly dragging a resistant Han-byeol away. That guy—when An-sol was in danger, he rushed back, but now he wasn’t even pretending to come help. I clicked my tongue, then dodged again as the monster’s foot slammed down.  
It was frustrating to keep dodging a creature that wasn’t even worth a punch, but I held back. I’d decided to take it down, so once the others were gone, I’d deal with it properly. Dust rose again as the monster stomped recklessly.  
To secure a clear view, I erased my presence with magic and slipped behind it. The moment my presence vanished, the blind boss monster’s head whipped around frantically, searching for me. I watched its twitching, almost neurotic movements with a bored expression, then glanced away.  
Thankfully, An-hyeon had dragged Han-byeol along, and all four had reached the warp gate. An-hyeon’s hair was a mess, likely from Han-byeol flailing at him. Honestly, it was kind of funny.  
As they arrived, the warp gate activated, enveloping them in a translucent barrier. A blue magical orb in the center began to vibrate, signaling the start of their transfer to the Summoning Room. Seeing their bodies wrapped in faint blue light, I let out a sigh of relief. My job was more or less done.  
Now for what was left…  
As the dust began to clear, I deliberately threw myself to the ground. I figured Han-byeol would nag me later about why I didn’t reach the warp gate sooner, so I planned to claim the tail’s impact was too much to recover from quickly.  
The dust settled completely, revealing the party bathed in intensifying blue light. Their bodies were gradually fading from the feet up, just like when they were first transported from the Preparation Room. Propping myself up slightly from the dirt, I waved at them—not with any deep meaning, just a “see you later” gesture.  
But then… An-hyeon wiped his eyes with one hand, Yu-jeong collapsed (her feet were already gone, so it looked odd) and burst into tears, Han-byeol covered her face with both hands, shoulders shaking, and An-sol waved frantically in my direction, tears streaming down her face.  
What? I didn’t mean to make them cry…
