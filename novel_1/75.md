# Chapter 74: The Pet Creation Project

“Welcome! Oh, a user I haven’t seen in Mul before,” a male priest clad in ceremonial robes greeted me with a hearty smile. 

“Considering the number of users coming and going daily, it’s no surprise to see a new face,” I replied.

“Haha, true enough. Anyway, welcome! Lately, most users have been flocking to Barbara or Khan, so things have been a bit quiet here. What brings you to the temple?” 

“There’s no way a temple wouldn’t have what I need. I’m here for gem appraisal and contract drafting. Oh, and I’d like to submit an expedition report while I’m at it.”

As soon as I mentioned the contract, the priest’s face lit up with an even brighter smile. Perhaps excited at the prospect of some business, he told me to wait a moment and hurriedly dashed inside. 

Vivian seemed engrossed in observing the temple’s surroundings, but I could tell—by slightly channeling my mana—that her attention was entirely fixated on the elixir tucked in my arms. Her adorable behavior brought a faint smile to my lips as I quietly waited for the priest to return.

Soon, I heard a loud “thud-thud” from the staircase leading to the second floor, followed by the sound of someone rushing down. The temple was one of the few places where users and residents coexisted as equals. Generally, residents served as messengers for the angels, while users handled most other tasks. The catch was that much of the users’ work involved interference from the residents.

A female user came barreling down, panting heavily as she stopped in front of me. Her tone was urgent as she spoke, with the male priest trailing behind her, his face tinged with a wry expression. Was the temple really that desperate for funds these days?

“W-Welcome! You’re here about a contract, right?” she asked.

“Yes, and an expedition report too—”

“We’re too busy to take expedition reports right now, so you can skip that. What kind of contract are we talking about?” 

No expedition reports? I frowned slightly at her words. It seemed the influence of the Golden Lion Clan was at play here. Skipping expedition reports was a poor choice—no wonder they never progressed later on. Deciding to get to the point and move on, I answered her question.

“Between a human and a human… or, to be precise, a user and a resident.”

The female priest glanced at me and then at Vivian behind me before nodding. 

“Hmm. A contract between a user and a resident is generally feasible. Have you thought about the contract’s contents?”

“I can write it up right now if you give me the contract form.”

“Great! Min-cheol, hand them the contract form.”

The male priest, called Min-cheol, promptly handed me a sheet of paper and a pen. I thought for a moment before beginning to write. The contents I was about to pen were simple in structure but far from trivial in impact. In essence, I was drafting what could be called a slave contract. I wrote briskly, the pen gliding across the paper, and once finished, I carefully reviewed the text.

1. User Kim Su-hyeon shall fulfill one request of Vivian’s choosing. In return, Vivian acknowledges and agrees to abide by the terms outlined in this contract.
2. Resident Vivian shall obey User Kim Su-hyeon’s instructions without defiance. While retaining her free will, she shall prioritize Kim Su-hyeon’s requests.
3. Resident Vivian shall support User Kim Su-hyeon and his party (namely An-hyeon, An-sol, and Lee Yu-jeong) wholeheartedly, both materially and emotionally, and shall never act with hostility toward them.

That should do it. With a dangerous smile, I showed the contract to Vivian first. She skimmed it hurriedly, nodded, and scrawled her signature before handing it back to me. I signed it as well and passed it to the female priest. The process was smooth as silk.

The female priest read through the contract and suddenly let out a stifled “pfft,” covering her mouth with one hand. She chuckled for a moment, but even after lowering her hand, one corner of her mouth remained curled as she looked at me. I met her gaze with a slight smile of my own.

“Hohohoho! Are you sure about this?” she asked.

“Hahaha! Make it as binding as possible, please.”

“No objections here.”

We shared a friendly laugh, and the female priest winked at me before turning to Vivian. 

“Are you really okay with this?” she asked.

“Huh? Oh, yeah. It’s just about listening and helping, right? No need for hostility either. But does a contract always take this long? Please hurry it up.”

The female priest shook her head with a pitying look but said nothing more. Vivian, however, kept shooting her impatient glances. Finally, the priest turned away from Vivian and spoke in a solemn tone.

“At this moment, I, User Lee Min-hye, bear witness that both parties have read and willingly signed this contract.”

As her words concluded, the paper she held glowed with a radiant light, accompanied by a sound like fireworks as it was enveloped in a white shimmer. This was the contract’s approval process. Vivian was momentarily entranced by the dazzling display, but through the light, I caught two users whispering to each other. I sharpened my hearing to listen in.

“Min-hye noona, isn’t this a bit too rushed? Like roasting beans over a lightning fire?”

“Who cares? It’s rare for money to roll in like this. A contract like this is practically top-tier.”

“Still…”

“And if the residents caught wind of this, they’d reject it outright. I feel a bit sorry for that female resident, but… well, it’s not our job to interfere.”

They spoke as if muttering to themselves, but my keen ears caught every word. I smirked inwardly, pleased that I’d entrusted this to users. Watching the contract finalize, I allowed myself a satisfied smile. Now, how would I handle Vivian moving forward—tease her, push her, mold her, or… ahem. Well, anyway.

After some time, the glowing light faded, and the contract floated down from the air. Lee Min-hye deftly caught it. Contract drafting usually took time, but this was done in a flash, leaving me wide-eyed. Reading my expression, Lee Min-hye smiled brightly and placed a scale on the table, seemingly out of nowhere, before speaking.

“Don’t worry, this isn’t some shoddy job. As you can see, priests handling contracts in the temple are granted special authority for this task. Of course, that authority vanishes the moment we leave this role.”

I nodded as she placed the contract on the scale. The weight of the contract would determine the cost I’d pay. As expected, the contract’s weight was substantial. The scale’s needle spun once, then twice, then three times—nearly eight full rotations. I wasn’t surprised, having anticipated this, but Vivian’s eyes betrayed worry. Not about the contract itself, but whether I could afford the cost. After closely inspecting the scale, Lee Min-hye approached me with a satisfied expression and whispered.

“User Kim Su-hyeon, are you aware of the binding power of a contract between a user and a resident?”

“Roughly. Contracts between users have many restrictions, but residents aren’t affected by the <Settings>, so…” I trailed off with a chuckle.

Lee Min-hye gave me a playful glare before handing me the contract.

“Exactly. Since residents aren’t bound by the <Settings>, the contract’s effect is far stronger, influencing even their inner will—almost to the point of compulsion. Congratulations on acquiring a fine slave. She’s quite pretty, too; your nights should be entertaining.”

“Haha, that’s not what I got her for. Don’t misunderstand.”

“Oh, come on, it’s obvious from how you’re dressed. Anyway, the total is 789 Gold, 417 Silver, and 216 Bronze. You know the temple doesn’t do installments, right?”

I brushed off her teasing and promptly paid the amount. Securing a capable ally for less than 800 Gold, one who’d be useful well into the late game, was an absolute steal. Vivian, initially shocked by the large sum, looked touched as I pulled out the payment without hesitation. At that moment, the contract took full effect. Of course, I still had to fulfill the price specified in the contract.

After bidding farewell to Lee Min-hye and Min-cheol, I tucked the contract safely into my robes and left the temple. Vivian, restless since the contract was finalized, kept glancing at me anxiously as I led her to a quieter, more secluded spot.

“It’s done, right? It’s really done?” 

As soon as we reached a place with fewer users around, Vivian rushed toward me, unable to contain herself. I gave her a sly smile and handed over the elixir. She snatched the bottle, her eyes trembling as she gazed at it.

“Hoo, hoo.”

Vivian took deep breaths, clearly having endured immense stress from her transformation into a spider. Her fierce will to survive and her loss of rationality had brought her to that state, but I was genuinely curious to see how she’d evolve from here. A resident with her level of skill was rare.

Seraph might scold me for this later, but I was prepared. Though Vivian was a boss monster meant to be defeated, I’d exploited a loophole in the records to make her my ally. It was a legitimate move, and I had my justifications ready.

Vivian stared at the elixir with a mix of longing and conflict, but her hesitation didn’t last long.

*Pop!*

“*Gulp.*”

She uncorked the bottle and downed its contents in one go. A refreshing sensation seemed to spread through her body as she shivered with delight. As I gently lifted her robe, I saw her cracked skin slowly mending. 

That wasn’t all. Her skin grew smoother and more vibrant, and her dull hair began to gleam with a lustrous black, asserting its presence. Her pale face flushed with a healthy glow, and her once-cold body warmed, taking on a soft peach-like hue.

One of the elixir’s greatest strengths was its immediate effect—no gradual recovery, just instant healing. As proof, I felt the powerful mana waves emanating from a fully restored mage standing before me.

But the one who felt it most was Vivian herself. She looked down at her hands and body in disbelief before her face lit up with joy, her fists clenched tightly. What was it like to reclaim lost power? Perhaps it was akin to the feeling I had in my first cycle, crawling back from the depths of hell to the world above.

After savoring her moment of triumph, Vivian slowly opened her eyes and looked at me. Her expression still carried that dazed, almost naive charm, but something had changed. Where her eyes once held the cloudy desperation of mere survival, they now sparkled with newfound confidence. Her small lips parted as she spoke.

“…Su-hyeon.”

“What?”

“Your name’s Su-hyeon, right? Kim Su-hyeon.”

“Yeah, so why’re you calling me?”

“Su-hyeon. Kim Su-hyeon. Kim Su-hyeon. Kim Su-hyeon.”

Ignoring my question, she kept repeating my name. I scratched my head as I felt a warmth in my chest—likely the contract updating itself. It was showtime. Deciding to test something, I fixed her with a mischievous grin. Her raven-black hair, silver eyes, and that oddly endearing blend of intelligence and innocence—she was undeniably beautiful. Under the pretense of testing the contract’s power, I spoke.

“Vivian.”

“Su-hyeon. Kim Su-hyeon.”

“Come here and—”

Before I could finish saying “hug me,” Vivian lunged forward, her tear-filled eyes locked on mine as she buried her face in my chest. Caught off guard by the sudden move, I froze but managed to stay calm, gently patting her back. Somehow, I understood her emotions.

The mood was nice, but this wasn’t what I’d intended. I wanted to test the contract’s compulsion, to see her reluctantly comply despite her protests—not this willing embrace. Oblivious to my thoughts, Vivian kept murmuring her gratitude.

“Thank you… thank you so much… really, thank you.”

“No need to thank me. It’s part of the contract… Wait, hold on. You’re practically naked under that robe!”

“I never thought I’d become human again… It’s okay. If it’s you, it’s okay. I’ll listen well from now on. Really, really well.”

What’s okay? Her sudden eagerness threw me off, and I tried to gently push her away. But the more I tried, the tighter she clung, wrapping her arms and even her legs around me like she did in her spider days. Was she really that overwhelmed with joy?

Watching her burrow into me like An-sol, I felt a mix of exasperation and amusement. But her soft, unmistakably feminine form pressed against me made me sigh deeply. I resolved then and there: tonight, I’d hold a woman, one way or another.
