# Chapter 133: Growing One Step Further

The moment Lee Yu-jeong revealed her face, she burst into sorrowful tears. Her emotions must be incredibly complex right now. Even though she knew she had done wrong, she had stubbornly held on with a childish mindset, only to feel increasingly alienated from the group as time went on. Moreover, when even I, her last bastion, didn’t come looking for her and left her be, it likely fueled her resentment even more.

I reached out with both arms, gently lifting Yu-jeong’s body and pulling her into an embrace. She cried with an even more heart-wrenching sound, and I continuously patted her back to comfort her.

“Waaah… Oppa… I’m sorry… I’m sorry… *sob*…”

“There, there. Our Yu-jeong is a good girl. Stop crying now. That’s it…”

“I’m sorry, Oppa… *sob*… I messed up…”

Yu-jeong kept repeating “I’m sorry” over and over. Her apologies likely carried layers of meaning. Honestly, on my way here, I had half a mind to scold her harshly if she insisted she hadn’t done anything wrong. But the moment I saw her reaction, that resolve melted away like snow.

Yu-jeong is usually brash and quick-tempered, but she has an equally pure side. I whispered that it was okay, soothing her gently.

How much time passed, I wondered. This was the first time I’d seen Yu-jeong cry for so long. Wiping the tear tracks from her flushed eyes and face, I spoke to her in a warm, gentle tone.

“Have you cried your fill now?”

“…”

There was no verbal reply, but I could see her head nodding a few times against my chest.

“Haha. Where’s that fiery woman who was cursing up a storm earlier? All I see now is a crybaby.”

“…That wasn’t… aimed at you, Oppa… I thought it was *that guy*…”

By “that guy,” she must mean An-hyeon. Curious about what An-hyeon had said to her, I decided to probe a little.

“Still, scratching and hitting like that was a bit much.”

“Nooo… *hic*… That guy kept… *hic*… saying nonsense…”

“I see. What did An-hyeon say?”

Her sobs hadn’t fully subsided, and she hiccupped as she spoke.

In response to my question, Yu-jeong lifted her face from my embrace, her expression full of frustration as she opened her mouth.

“He barged in out of nowhere… saying things like, ‘Aren’t you embarrassed in front of everyone?’ and ‘You’re just jealous because I got a Rare Class, aren’t you?’…”

“And then?”

“And then… he said you’ve been looking at me really badly lately because of the Go Yeon-ju thing… and told me to hurry up and go to you… *hic*… And then he suddenly yanked off my blanket and tried to drag me out… I was already upset to death, so I just lost it and…”

“I see. I only told him to bring you, but I didn’t know that happened.”

“Ugh…”

As I responded kindly, Yu-jeong’s expression softened slightly, and she buried her face in my chest again. Looking at her sleek hair, I let out a soft chuckle.

Strictly speaking, An-hyeon’s words weren’t entirely wrong. But he was utterly clueless when it came to handling women. He should’ve been more tactful, especially with Yu-jeong, but instead, he threw blunt accusations at her. Worse, since An-hyeon had been subtly bragging about getting a Rare Class, it probably rubbed her the wrong way.

Stroking Yu-jeong’s fine hair, I spoke in a calm, steady voice.

“What that guy said might’ve been harsh, but it wasn’t entirely nonsense… You know that, right?”

“Yeah… Honestly, the moment he said it, I couldn’t argue back. I wanted to say something, but no words came out. But the resentment just kept building up… and that’s why I ended up cursing and lashing out…”

Her voice was dry as she responded. Then, in a forlorn tone, she continued.

“I know I’m ridiculous and pathetic… Acting all high and mighty in front of everyone, but then behaving like this. Like An-hyeon said, everyone must think I’m a joke. My teammate did well, and instead of congratulating them, I’m just filled with ugly jealousy…”

“It’s okay. Realizing that is enough. If you truly feel that way, you’ve already taken the first step toward growth. Acknowledging and facing your flaws is the starting point for moving upward.”

“Really? You always say such nice things, Oppa.”

Hearing Yu-jeong’s sulky voice, I felt the moment had come. I gently lifted her chin to meet her gaze, then spoke with a serious expression.

“I’m not lying, Yu-jeong. Do you really want to get stronger?”

Perhaps sensing the sincerity in my voice, Yu-jeong nodded immediately.

“Yeah. I don’t know what you think, but I want to get a Rare or Secret Class too. I haven’t been much help in battles so far… If I keep going like this, I’ll fall behind forever.”

“I won’t deny that Rare or Secret Classes are better than regular ones. Especially Secret Classes, which come with unique <Authority> powers, so there’s definitely a difference. But that doesn’t mean regular classes are inherently inferior. Depending on the user’s abilities, stats, and how they harmonize with Hall Plane’s <Settings>, a regular class can still wield great power.”

“Really… Is that true…?”

“They say two of the current <Ten Strongest> have regular classes. In other words, while eight of them have Rare or Secret Classes, if I were you, I’d take those two as role models and try to break through that narrow gate. And your class, <Mercenary>, has a lot of potential too.”

Despite the upheaval caused by the failed Steel Mountains expedition, the battles among wanderers, and the First Civil War, which shook up the <Ten Strongest> rankings, my words held true for now. There were indeed users with regular classes who had made a name for themselves. In my first cycle, I could recall more than a few such users.

Of course, users with Rare or Secret Classes were far more numerous, but Yu-jeong wasn’t without hope. And I wasn’t expecting her to reach the level of the <Ten Strongest>. If she could grow into a top-tier or high-ranking user to back me up, I’d be satisfied. Honestly, considering she’s a Year 0 user, her stats are far from lacking.

I reached into my cloak and pulled out the Magic Sword Skrep. Seeing the rusty red blade, a spark of curiosity lit up Yu-jeong’s face. Though it looked like a simple curved dagger that could be swung lightly with one hand, it was undeniably a fearsome magic sword.

The Magic Sword of the high-ranking demon Belphegor. Despite its rusted appearance, it boasts incredible durability and razor-sharp cutting power. Wounds inflicted by it cause continuous bleeding due to the sword’s curse effect, and as it drinks blood, the blade turns redder, emanating an even sharper aura.

I had deliberated a lot about whether to give it to her now. No matter how powerful it was, being a magic sword, Skrep would gradually erode the user’s psyche with prolonged use. In the worst case, it could turn its wielder into a bloodthirsty maniac.

Yet, I had two reasons for offering it to her now.

First, I could control Skrep. Whether it was because of my Sword Specialist class or the influence of my True Name (Master of the Sword), I wasn’t sure, but Skrep had submitted to me from the moment we met. Considering how magic swords typically try to dominate their users, the faint vibrations Skrep emitted earlier in the room were practically tame. If I noticed even the slightest sign of trouble with Yu-jeong, I’d discard the sword immediately.

Second, there was a synergy between Yu-jeong and the sword—a perfect match. Yu-jeong was endlessly soft toward those she liked but vehemently disliked those she didn’t. This trait had surfaced a few times in past battles. I was banking on that. If Skrep could channel her personality in a controlled way, it could unlock far greater potential than she currently had.

“Oppa, what’s this ugly dagger…?”

Before Yu-jeong could finish, Skrep let out a low “Humm!” vibration. Seeing her startled expression as she flinched, I gave a faint smile.

“An item from the Ruined Laboratory. It’s the Magic Sword Skrep, once wielded by the demon Belphegor.”

“Magic Sword? Skrep?”

As Yu-jeong tilted her head and reached for it, I subtly pulled the sword back. Meeting her puzzled gaze, I began to explain.

“Listen carefully. Skrep is a type of magic sword. Magic swords are imbued with dark magic—things like sorrow, desire, curses, or calamity. These powers are incredibly strong, but they also affect the user’s mind. This Skrep, for instance, won’t be satisfied unless it tastes blood in battle.”

“…”

“But that doesn’t mean magic swords are inherently bad. Holy swords are similar in that they demand a price from their users. In the end, holy swords and magic swords are two sides of the same coin. If you can master this sword, you’ll take a huge step forward. But if you let it control you, it’ll lead you to ruin.”

Of course, I was her safety net for such risks. But Yu-jeong, unaware of that, pressed her lips shut and hardened her expression. Her outstretched hand froze in midair. Watching her reaction, I continued in a dry tone.

“So I thought long and hard about this. I’m still not sure if I should give Skrep to you right now. But seeing you struggle lately, I decided to bring it up. It’s your choice. Will you take the gamble and wield this sword, or would you rather gain more experience in your current state and try later?”

“Gamble…?”

“Yes. The moment you take Skrep, whether you like it or not, you’ll lose a part of your old self. If you’re okay with that—if you’re determined to find a breakthrough—then go ahead and try.”

“Oppa…”

Seeing her anxious expression as she called out to me, I gave a gentle smile. I placed Skrep on the table and slowly turned, continuing to speak.

“This isn’t something I can decide for you. I’m not saying you have to choose right now. We still have some time before we set out, so think it over carefully.”

I felt her gaze, wanting to hold me back, but I strode toward the door. Just before stepping out, I glanced back.

“I miss the lively Yu-jeong from before. I’d love to see you smiling again by tomorrow morning.”

“Mm…”

Yu-jeong alternated between looking at Skrep on the table and my face. This was her first major choice since entering Hall Plane, and she was probably feeling very uneasy. Deciding to give her a little more encouragement, I spoke again.

“No matter what you choose, I’ll respect your decision. I promise.”

With that, I walked out the door.

*

The second-floor hallway of the <Modest Lady> inn was cloaked in complete darkness. As I moved toward the stairs, I mulled over what had just happened.

I had achieved my initial goal: bringing Yu-jeong back to her senses. As for Skrep, it felt right to leave that choice to her.

Whether she took it or not, either was fine. As I started up the stairs, wondering what she’d decide in the time remaining, I paused mid-step, staring into a corner. There was no one there, but my sharp senses couldn’t be fooled.

Even as I stared, the surroundings remained deathly silent. When no one emerged after a while, I finally spoke in a quiet voice.

“Come out.”

Silence. Despite my words, a cold stillness lingered between the stairs and the hallway. Whoever it was seemed well-hidden, but they couldn’t escape my Third Eye. Sighing, I pulled a cigarette from my cloak and stepped back down the stairs. Then, I held the cigarette out toward where I sensed a mouth.

“…”

They probably didn’t expect me to pinpoint their exact location, down to their face. As if confirming my guess, something invisible stirred slightly, and I felt the cigarette’s tip being gently bitten.
