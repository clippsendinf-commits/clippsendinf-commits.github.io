# Memorize - Chapter 141: The End of Training

There is a saying, *Ingan mansa saeongjima* (人間萬事 塞翁之馬), which means that in human affairs, fortune and misfortune are not fixed. Luck can turn into calamity, and calamity can become fortune. Lately, I’ve been reflecting on this phrase quite often.

Of course, the place I’m in now is Hall Plane, a different world altogether. When I think back to my first cycle, the saying *saeongjima* barely applied. My life in Hall Plane felt like a relentless string of misfortunes. I can scarcely recall a single day of peace. Whenever I tasted a sliver of fortune or joy, it was inevitably followed by a misfortune so great it shattered that happiness. Or perhaps, in a way, the saying held true—not because fortune and misfortune were evenly split, but because misfortune dominated the scales, far outweighing any fleeting moments of luck.

The sudden recollection of my first cycle brought a bitter taste to my thoughts. What is Hyung doing right now? What about Han So-yeong? And what of all the users I crossed paths with?

It’s not that I never thought of Hyung or her. When I first arrived in Hall Plane, I considered seeking them out immediately. Yu-hyeon Hyung would never abandon me, regardless of my abilities as a user, and Han So-yeong would never let someone of my caliber slip through her fingers. Her ambition for talent and her ability to embrace both the virtuous and the wicked were among her many strengths.

Yet, I chose not to seek them out for two reasons.

The first reason was that both of them had already established themselves—or were in the process of doing so—as prominent users. Yu-hyeon Hyung is likely making a name for himself in one of the eastern cities by now. I heard he didn’t participate in the Golden Lion Clan’s Steel Mountains expedition in my first cycle, so it’s probable he also stayed out of the Vagabond Extermination Operation.

Han So-yeong was in a similar position. She was already the Clan Lord of <Istantel Rowe>, the leading clan in the southwestern city of Monica. As one of the prominent clans in the southern cities, they avoided involvement in major operations and expeditions. Right now, she’s probably caught up in rumors that her clan will gradually fade due to the Golden Lion Clan’s resentment. But after the Steel Mountains expedition, <Istantel Rowe>’s influence will soar dramatically.

As such, even if I approached them now, I might offer some help, but I wouldn’t be able to steer things my way. They’ve already surrounded themselves with capable users, so expecting them to follow my lead would be wishful thinking.

Rather than being stifled in their shadow, I decided it would be better to build my own faction and meet them on equal footing. In the latter stages of Hall Plane, alliances between clans are indispensable. Combining forces with others is far more efficient than relying solely on my own strength.

The second reason is somewhat tied to the first. Even without my interference, Hyung and Han So-yeong are users who can thrive on their own. I saw how keenly they read the flow of events in my first cycle. I didn’t want to meddle and artificially alter their futures, which were already set to unfold smoothly. Of course, I wrestled with this decision, but obtaining a Rare Class in Mul and defeating the high-ranking demon Belphegor gave me confidence in my choice. Had I gone to them right after graduating from the User Academy, I likely wouldn’t have achieved these results.

I harbor no regrets. Yet, why does this heavy sense of pressure weigh on my heart? A sudden wave of frustration washed over me, and I let out a deep sigh.

*Ingan mansa saeongjima*. Right now, our party is riding a wave of fortune. Even though my presence as a variable plays a role, it’s undeniable that luck is on our side, both outwardly and inwardly. Unexpected Rare Classes, high-quality equipment, skilled users, and the execution of the high-ranking demon Belphegor—things are progressing in a direction far better than I had anticipated.

Reflecting on it, I realized that during my time in Hall Plane, misfortune had always been more prevalent. Perhaps I’m struggling to adjust to this streak of continuous fortune. With that in mind, I decided to set aside the persistent unease I’d felt since leaving Mul. Misfortune may come, but I can prepare for it. While there’s no guarantee the future will unfold exactly as I know it, my knowledge of the broader currents allows me to plan thoroughly and minimize the impact of any impending misfortunes. Perhaps my decision to push the party with rapid marches—to temper their spirits and guard against arrogance—stems from this very mindset.

I maintained my pace while carefully observing the surrounding scenery. This path was one I was supposed to walk two years from now. It’s not identical to how I remember it, but the feeling is unmistakably similar.

The <Dungeon of the Ancient Alchemist Vivian> lies within the pitch-black Black Forest, and the <Ruined Laboratory> requires crossing the northern wasteland. But the <Screaming Cavern> is hidden deep within countless mountain ranges. As we walked, the landscape around us was filled with gently swaying green grass and solitary trees, giving the impression of traversing a vast plain. It truly felt like we were on a picnic, just as Ha-yeon had once said.

“Wow, it’s like we’re on a field trip or something,” An-sol remarked.

“Yeah, it’d be nice if those monsters didn’t keep popping up,” Vivian replied.

An-sol and Vivian chatted amiably as they marched. Vivian’s conversation was a subtle act of consideration for An-sol. While the rest of the party had mostly adapted, An-sol, with her stamina stat in the low 30s, occasionally struggled. Still, she pressed on, biting her lip and trudging forward without complaint.

In the military, marching alone is grueling, but chatting with a friend ahead or behind you can make you forget the fatigue in your legs. Since their chatter wasn’t disrupting the caravan’s mood, I decided to let it slide. Truth be told, I had been overly strict with the group under the guise of discipline, partly because I preferred a quiet atmosphere.

In that regard, Go Yeon-ju was remarkably perceptive. She had an innate talent for reading people’s personalities and emotions. Her approach to others varied drastically depending on the situation.

She carried herself as if she were genuinely enjoying the expedition, like a leisurely outing. Most users who reach the ranks of the <Ten Strongest> carry a sense of authority born of confidence in their abilities. But Go Yeon-ju lacked that rigidity. Since leaving the city, she had observed my behavior closely and began tending to the others with kindness and care. (Though, to be honest, it felt like a calculated push-and-pull. In the city and out here, she and I had swapped our usual roles, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was playing a deliberate game.) Her actions almost felt like those of a supportive partner.

Go Yeon-ju occasionally joined in An-sol and Vivian’s conversation, matching their rhythm, and shared stories that were helpful for navigating Hall Plane. As a fifth-year user, she had plenty of tales to tell, enough to ease the strain of the rapid march for the group. I listened to her stories now and then, leading the party in a relatively good mood.

The further we got from Mul, the less luck we had compared to the early stages of the expedition. Encounters with monsters were becoming more frequent. Even today, though it wasn’t yet time to set up camp, we had already faced our fourth group of monsters.

The creatures we’d just encountered were new to the group: Mud Magoils. Magoils are golem-like monsters with bodies made of mud and hard stone, sporting humanoid faces with a malevolent edge. They lack magical attack capabilities but possess terrifying strength and self-regeneration, making them formidable opponents.

However, their critical weakness is their slow movement and sluggish bodies. To exploit this, I ordered the mages to launch a preemptive strike, and they responded magnificently.

Ha-yeon didn’t cast an attack spell this time. Drawing on her past experience with Magoils, she used a large-scale water spell combined with Overlap to douse the Magoils’ bodies, soaking them thoroughly and softening their muddy forms. This created an ideal environment for our close-combat fighters.

Shin Sang-yong used Chain Lightning to further slow the lumbering Magoils, while Vivian summoned her beast, Aranya, to entangle their bodies. Vivian’s performance in this battle was particularly outstanding.

She wrapped up nearly ten Magoils, manipulating their limbs like marionettes in a comically absurd spectacle. When she swung their limbs so violently that one or two tore off, it drew chuckles from the group. These were not enemies to underestimate, but the precise application of each user’s abilities made the battle feel almost effortless.

“Ho ho, An-hyeon, you look bored,” Yu-jeong teased, eyeing An-hyeon, who stood with his spear, looking idle.

An-hyeon smirked. “Yeah, you’re right. Su-hyeon Hyung and I don’t have much to do. Bet Hyung’s bored too.”

Yu-jeong, who had been leveraging her earlier contributions to needle An-hyeon, clammed up when he brought me into it. Glaring at him for a moment, she snapped, “That’s low. How dare you drag Oppa into this? You’re not on his level!” before stomping back to her position.

An-hyeon watched Yu-jeong’s retreating figure, her hips swaying, and chuckled before turning away. I studied his face closely. There was a glint of confidence in his eyes, as if he were hiding an ace up his sleeve—perhaps a firm belief that he held an edge over Yu-jeong.

By the time the ten or so Magoils reached us, their numbers had been reduced to less than half. None of them were unscathed; each was missing a limb or two, or worse. In the end, Go Yeon-ju, An-hyeon, Yu-jeong, and I each took on one of the remaining Magoils, wrapping up the battle with ease.

Afterward, we pressed deeper into the mountain peaks ahead, but as we marched, early evening set in. Normally, we could have kept going, but the mountains brought darkness faster than expected. I spotted a suitable spot for camping and paused to consider. Our pace had been faster than anticipated, and we’d already covered the day’s planned distance. Was there a need to push further?

Though the light was fading, I decided to keep marching. Since we were making good progress, it seemed wise to cover as much ground as possible. Just as I was about to declare another march after a brief rest, Go Yeon-ju stood and approached me.

“User Kim Su-hyeon, I have a question.”

“Go ahead.”

“How much distance is left to our destination?”

“Hmm, one moment.”

At her question, I unfolded the map and calculated the distance we’d covered. After today, it would be a week since we left Mul. We’d covered roughly 70% of the journey. I gave her an approximate figure, and she flashed a meaningful smile before stepping closer. After glancing at the rest of the party, she leaned in and whispered softly in my ear.

“One more thing I’m curious about.”

“You could just ask out loud,” I grumbled.

She smiled faintly and continued, “Are you going to keep the tail or shake it off?”
