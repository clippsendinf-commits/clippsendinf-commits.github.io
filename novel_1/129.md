# Memorize - Chapter 128 (128/1068)

# Temporary Alliance

“You’ve been sighing a lot lately,” I said.

Rolling her eyes playfully, Go Yeon-ju flashed a faint smile and nodded. “Well, my head’s been a bit cluttered.”

“When your mind’s tangled, resting’s the best remedy. How about taking a break from work and doing something to lift your spirits?”

“Oh my, is this a date invitation? You’ve been so aloof despite all my teasing before,” she replied.

We’d slipped back into formal speech with each other, a subtle signal to wrap up the conversation. Her response suggested she’d caught the gist of my intentions. I tapped her forehead lightly—she wrinkled her brow slightly—and answered in a calm tone.

“Haha, you could call it a date. I’m planning to head out for an expedition next month. How about we hold hands and go together? I know a good spot.”

Go Yeon-ju let out a soft chuckle and shook her head. “…So, for User Kim Su-hyeon, a date means holding hands, laughing, and swinging swords at monsters?”

“Better than moping around in an inn,” I shot back.

“I shouldn’t have said anything. How long are you thinking?”

“Three weeks.”

Her face went blank at my straightforward answer, then her eyes narrowed as she spoke. “…Trying to ruin my inn? Do you know how much I spent building this place?”

“It’s already failing. Hardly any users come by except us.”

“…Tch.”

My blunt remark left her speechless, and she pursed her lips, turning her head away. As an aside, her head was still resting on my lap, which was more than a little distracting as she shifted it back and forth. I gently turned her head back to face me and continued, “I said it’s a good spot. Don’t worry too much. It’ll be far more profitable than running this inn for three weeks.”

“Hmph. Planning to find another dungeon, I presume?” she muttered.

I responded with a deadpan expression, “Oh, how did you know?”

“…”

Go Yeon-ju stared at me, at a loss for words.

---

After finishing my morning meditation and washing up, I stepped out to find the inn in utter chaos. The kids, who’d normally be fast asleep at this hour, were gathered on the first floor, their faces etched with anxiety. As I descended the stairs, all eyes turned to me.

“O-Oppa,” An-sol stammered.

“Yes, Sol? What’s wrong?”

“It’s a disaster! The inn’s closing!”

“…Pfft.”

Her words made me burst out laughing.

An-hyeon and Yu-jeong looked disheveled, likely dragged out of bed, but An-sol was relatively neat, probably having woken up early and come downstairs. She must’ve seen Go Yeon-ju’s actions, panicked, and woken everyone else. Not seeing me, she’d roused the others instead. I could picture her frantic behavior clearly. Scratching my head, I casually took a seat.

“Ugh, Oppa, did you hear something from the innkeeper?” Yu-jeong plopped down beside me, her eyes half-closed, clearly grumpy from being woken up. When I didn’t respond, she leaned her head lightly against my shoulder. I brushed her hair gently, and her expression softened.

An-hyeon was blankly looking around, while An-sol fidgeted nervously, tapping her foot. (I didn’t think her anxiety was because Yu-jeong was leaning on me, but who knows.) Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong sat quietly at a table, likely piecing things together from last night’s events.

Soon, the inn’s door creaked open, and a familiar user stepped in. Go Yeon-ju closed the door firmly behind her and walked toward me. Meeting her gaze, I spoke in a relaxed tone, “Busy moving around this early in the morning, huh?”

“Thanks to someone,” she replied. “Pretty cheap move… ugh. Anyway, as they say, strike while the iron’s hot. Things have been a bit tedious lately, so I figured I’d kill two birds with one stone.”

She was probably referring to our haggling over her life last night with that “cheap” jab. Her words carried a sharp edge, but I shrugged and continued, “You could’ve given me a heads-up. Hurry up and refund the rest of our stay.”

Go Yeon-ju bit her lip and shot me a piercing glare. “Hmph. Looks like your group’s all here. Let’s have breakfast. What’ll it be?”

“Same as always. Seven portions of Course A.”

“Eight portions of Course A. What, am I not eating?” she retorted, poking my chest before heading to the kitchen.

The kids, listening to our exchange, looked utterly confused, question marks practically floating above their heads. Shin Sang-yong, however, wore a serious expression and spoke in a low voice, “Leader.”

“Yes?”

“You’re quite the strategist.”

“Haha…” I let out an awkward laugh.

Ha-yeon, who’d been hesitant, covered her mouth in shock. “Su-hyeon… did you… with her…?”

“No, we made a deal,” I clarified.

“A deal?” she asked, skeptical.

I nodded once, gesturing for the still-standing kids to sit. An-hyeon, who’d been tilting his head in confusion, and An-sol, who’d been glaring at Yu-jeong, quickly took their seats at my signal.

“I can’t share the details of the deal yet,” I said. “But she’s agreed to close the inn for at least three weeks. The official reason is that business has been slow.”

The group nodded, clearly agreeing. They’d noticed the lack of users at the inn lately. I continued, “During that time, she’ll join our caravan. As a fifth-year user, I believe she’ll be a great asset. That’s the gist of it. We’ll discuss details when she returns. Any questions?”

Vivian immediately raised her hand. I nodded, granting her permission to speak.

“Kim Su-hyeon, I know you have your reasons for bringing her in, but I’m a bit worried,” she said.

“About what?”

“You said three weeks or more, so she might join our next expedition, right?”

“Most likely.”

“Even if she’s a fifth-year user, can she really fit in with our caravan? She’s just an innkeeper… Honestly, it makes me a little uneasy.”

At Vivian’s words, Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong exchanged faint smiles. Her concern wasn’t entirely baseless. Though she’d adapted to the modern Hall Plane as a human, Vivian sometimes confused it with the ancient Hall Plane.

I clicked my tongue and addressed everyone. “Vivian.”

“Yeah?”

“If you can hold your own against that female user for ten minutes, I’ll never tease you again.”

“W-What?”

“Huh?”

“What?”

“Uh.”

Vivian, An-sol, Yu-jeong, and An-hyeon gasped in turn. Even with Ha-yeon’s addition, Vivian was still undeniably the caravan’s second-in-command. Her usual ditzy personality didn’t exude authority, but in expeditions, she always showcased her skills without fail.

My claim that the innkeeper outranked Vivian shocked them. Honestly, while Vivian was skilled, she wasn’t a match for Go Yeon-ju, who was among the <Ten Strongest>. Even if Vivian summoned her top-tier First Legion, Go Yeon-ju’s special ability <Abyss Crowd> could counter it, and it was doubtful she’d even give Vivian time to summon a higher legion.

If Go Yeon-ju and Vivian fought, it’d be a landslide victory for Go Yeon-ju. Confident, I said, “I vouch for her skills. What do you say, Vivian?”

Her face flushed red, and she lowered her head, muttering, “I-I don’t want that.”

“Huh?”

“I said I don’t want that!”

“Alright, next question?” I quickly changed the subject, hoping the others hadn’t caught the dangerous undertone in Vivian’s refusal. Fortunately, Yu-jeong was lost in memories of our first day in Mul, mumbling, “Yeah… something was definitely off back then…” An-hyeon and An-sol were blankly staring at each other, while Shin Sang-yong kept glancing toward the kitchen, wondering when Go Yeon-ju would return. Only Ha-yeon had her eyes closed, her thoughts unreadable.

I was a bit surprised by Go Yeon-ju’s actions myself. I’d expected it to take some time after our talk, but she’d moved decisively. Quite the fiery one, I thought—though “unexpected” might not be the right word.

Just then, the sound of a cart rolling from the kitchen reached us. An-hyeon, snapping out of his daze, blinked rapidly and jumped up from his chair.

“Hyung, I’m gonna go wash up real quick.”

“Why not eat first?”

“N-No, I’ll be right back!”

Without waiting for my reply, An-hyeon bolted up the stairs, moving faster than I’d ever seen. Shaking my head at his haste, I felt a lightness in my mood as I awaited breakfast.

Go Yeon-ju pushed the cart right up to our table, calmly setting out the food before taking a seat. Glancing around at the group, her eyes landed on An-sol, who was sneaking glances at her. She spoke, “Morning, little one. Where’s your brother?”

“H-He… um… went to wash up…” An-sol mumbled hesitantly.

“Hm? What was that? Speak up a bit,” Go Yeon-ju said, leaning closer.

“Eek…” An-sol, painfully shy, pursed her lips and looked to me for rescue.

Yu-jeong sighed at An-sol’s reaction and answered for her, “He went to wash up.”

“Ah, cute. Anyway, User Kim Su-hyeon, have you told them about me?” Go Yeon-ju asked.

“To an extent. Want to fill in the rest now?”

“They’ll figure it out as we go. I’ll talk after breakfast when everyone’s here. For now, dig in. It’s best when it’s warm.”

She shook her head lightly. Compared to yesterday, she was noticeably calmer, dressed more modestly, and her expression was as gentle as usual.

Despite her kind urging to eat, no one touched their utensils. When she looked around curiously, the group was staring at me. I sighed, picked up my spoon, and took a sip of soup. Only then did the others begin eating. Go Yeon-ju started her meal as well, but the twitching corners of her mouth betrayed her amusement. I silently vowed to break this annoying habit soon—and shot a brief, resentful glance at Yu-jeong, the instigator of this ritual.

A short while later, the sound of An-hyeon tumbling down the stairs echoed. His face was still damp, as if he’d hastily splashed water on it. The hurried footsteps slowed as he reached the first floor, transitioning into measured strides that resonated through the lobby.

As An-hyeon approached our table, he caught sight of Go Yeon-ju and feigned surprise, as if noticing her for the first time. In a polite tone, he said, “Oh, you’re joining us for breakfast today.”

“Yes, that’s how it turned out,” Go Yeon-ju replied with a charming smile.

An-hyeon bowed slightly and continued, “It’s an honor to meet you like this. I’m An-hyeon, a zero-year user. My class… well, I use a spear.”

His face radiated pride. Yu-jeong, mid-bite of her stew, made a face like she was about to gag. An-sol, despite being his sister, pretended not to know him. Amused by their reactions, Go Yeon-ju covered her mouth, chuckling, before responding in a languid tone, “Nice to meet you. I’m Go Yeon-ju, a fifth-year user. My class… the Shadow Queen.”

“Oh, I see—”

“Pfft!”

At that moment, An-sol, who’d been sipping water, sprayed it out dramatically.

She’d clearly heard of the Shadow Queen before—our top student, as expected.
