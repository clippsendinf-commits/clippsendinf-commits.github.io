# Chapter 35: To the Hall Plane!

If you look at it simply, the Hall Plane can be divided into four major continents. The currently explored regions consist of the Eastern Continent, Western Continent, Southern Continent, and Northern Continent, each under the jurisdiction of Users and Residents (the original inhabitants of the Hall Plane). However, the reality of the Hall Plane is that unexplored regions vastly outnumber the explored ones. If one were to venture into the uncharted territories surrounding them for even a single day, no one but the traveler themselves would know what dangers lurk.

To alleviate the unease caused by these unexplored regions, the only option was to organize expeditions and conquer those areas. Even if passages were established between continents or cities, the uncharted zones blocking the way forward and backward would always leave them trembling with uncertainty.

An-hyeon’s party had been assigned to start their journey in the Hall Plane on the Northern Continent. Those who proved their qualifications in the Rite of Passage were summoned for the first time to a place called the *Inn of Beginnings*, located in the major cities of each continent. Since there were five such inns, it meant there were five separate spaces where the Rite of Passage trials were conducted simultaneously.

Thanks to the angels’ arrangements, An-hyeon’s party was among the first to arrive. As they had been told, they woke up in the inn and descended to the first floor. They sat around a table, waiting for the other Users to arrive.

The inn itself had nothing particularly remarkable about it. It seemed designed solely for sleeping and waiting for others. There were doors and windows leading outside, but when An-hyeon looked through the window, he gave up on the idea of leaving. The world outside was entirely shrouded in a bluish haze. A faint, azure barrier enveloped the inn, making it impossible to see even an inch ahead. It almost felt as if the inside and outside of the inn were completely separate realms.

The interior of the inn was still quiet, with only a heavy silence lingering. An-hyeon paced around the window for a moment before cautiously sitting down. His eyes fell on familiar faces: An-sol, Yu-jeong, and Han-byeol. Since their reunion, not a single word had been exchanged between them. No, it was more accurate to say they *couldn’t* bring themselves to speak.

Glancing at his younger sister, An-hyeon saw her trembling uncontrollably, her teeth chattering. It was clear at a glance that she was in a bad state. He could tell she was tormented by guilt. An-hyeon, too, felt his body quiver with an inexplicable anxiety that filled him. The source of that anxiety was the realization that Kim Su-hyeon was no longer with them. The person who had been their shield, their anchor, was gone, and the space they had relied on had vanished.

Suddenly, Su-hyeon’s face flashed in An-hyeon’s mind. His calm demeanor, composed attitude, and quiet voice somehow instilled an inexplicable confidence. Though they had known him for less than a week, in that short time, he had left a deep impression on their hearts.

“Run! You idiots! Get to the Warp Gate!”

An-hyeon could still see Su-hyeon, struck by the monster’s tail and collapsing, yet smiling and waving at them. Even now, An-hyeon felt keenly that he was nothing without him. It was because Su-hyeon had been there, steadfastly supporting them from behind, that An-hyeon had been able to step forward. And, knowingly or not, he had relied on Su-hyeon far too much.

Every time he recalled that Su-hyeon had sacrificed himself to save his sister, An-hyeon couldn’t bring himself to look at Yu-jeong or Han-byeol. But summoning his courage, he lifted his somber face. He wanted to see how the others were faring.

Yu-jeong had buried herself in the table. As soon as they came downstairs, she had slumped down and hadn’t moved since. The occasional faint trembling of her shoulders showed she wasn’t asleep. It seemed she didn’t want to show her weakness to others.

An-sol was no better. She wasn’t wailing as she had at first, but tears still clung to her delicate eyebrows as she stared at the floor. It appeared she hadn’t run out of tears yet. Even the angel setting up their basic configurations had to gently console her. Only Han-byeol maintained her initial cold expression. An-hyeon couldn’t tell what she was thinking, but a chilly aura seemed to linger around her.

No one spoke, and the inn remained cloaked in silence, broken only by the occasional sob from someone unknown. But as time passed, the inn began to grow noisier.

The sounds came from the second floor, where multiple voices overlapped, creating a commotion. The door to the second-floor lodging, where they had come from, opened, and unfamiliar voices reached their ears. An-hyeon instinctively knew these were the other survivors from the Rite of Passage. In that moment, a thought flashed through his mind like lightning.

*Maybe Su-hyeon hyung is among them. Maybe he escaped. If so…*

An-hyeon shot to his feet. The sudden noise drew everyone’s attention to him. Even Yu-jeong, with her swollen eyes, looked up at him unsteadily. In an excited tone, he spoke.

“Hyung, Su-hyeon hyung might be here.”

“…What are you talking about?” Yu-jeong asked in a hoarse voice.

An-hyeon pointed to the staircase leading to the second floor, where the door for the survivors was located. “We’re not the only ones who survived. Other survivors must have been teleported here too. Maybe hyung is among them…”

The moment Yu-jeong heard this, she sprang up and bolted toward the staircase. An-sol, perhaps thinking it was possible, lifted her head and followed Yu-jeong. Only Han-byeol looked reluctant, as if she hadn’t held any expectations to begin with.

Humans are such sad creatures. Once again, they were rationalizing their hopes. They had all clearly seen Kim Su-hyeon collapse before that monstrous creature. They remembered shedding tears at his final farewell. Yet now, the faint hope of “maybe” dominated their minds.

“If it’s Su-hyeon hyung, he definitely escaped, right? He would.”

“Y-yeah! If it’s Su-hyeon oppa, he’s the kind of person who’d come strutting in, alive and well, just like he did back in that city. Right? Totally!”

An-hyeon and Yu-jeong exchanged trembling words, nodding to each other. As they reached the staircase and prepared to ascend, the sound of the door clicking open rang out. Instantly, as if by magic, their movements froze, and all eyes turned upward. A pounding tension filled their bodies.

When the door opened, the figures that emerged… were, unfortunately, not Kim Su-hyeon. However, they were people An-hyeon’s party had met before. Four people descended, and the one in the lead, upon seeing An-hyeon’s group, lit up with recognition.

“Oh, you guys got here first. Anyway, good to see you alive.”

“Huh? Woo Jeong-min? Who are these… Oh, those rookies from before? Weren’t they all dead? Didn’t they say they were heading to the Warp Gate?”

“…Cheon Seung-hyeon, shut up.”

Woo Jeong-min, Cheon Seung-hyeon, and Seon Yu-un exchanged words as they descended to the first-floor lobby. Won Hye-su, who had lost her younger sister, followed quietly, her face full of sorrow, hinting at what had happened afterward.

But An-hyeon’s party had no capacity to care about such things. Confirming Su-hyeon’s fate with their own eyes was their top priority. The moment they saw Woo Jeong-min’s group, disappointment quickly settled over their faces. Sensing the odd atmosphere, Seon Yu-un led Won Hye-su to a table and sat down. Only Cheon Seung-hyeon grumbled with a dissatisfied expression.

“Tch, no need to look so openly depressed. We’re all in the same boat, so you’re making this awkward. Alright, alright. Sorry about throwing that dagger back then.”

“…Yeah.”

“Really, I’m sorry. I reflected a lot since then.”

“…It’s fine.”

“R-really? Good then. Haha… ha…”

Hearing Yu-jeong’s curt response, Cheon Seung-hyeon’s face grew even more awkward. He seemed to wonder why he wasn’t usually this shy, tilting his head. Woo Jeong-min, also sensing the strange mood, scanned the group calmly before speaking.

“Now that I think about it, one of you is missing. Where’s the guy with the crossbow?”

At Woo Jeong-min’s question, the group remained silent. Being quick-witted, Woo Jeong-min seemed to piece together the situation. If someone wasn’t here, it likely meant they had died in the Rite of Passage.

“What… did he get taken out? I told him not to go to the Warp Gate, but it seems he didn’t listen. So how did you guys…”

“He’s not dead!”

“He’s not dead!”

Before Jeong-min could finish, Yu-jeong and An-sol shouted in unison. Seeing Yu-jeong’s outburst, Cheon Seung-hyeon nodded, puzzled. Jeong-min, momentarily embarrassed, turned to An-hyeon calmly.

“Did you encounter that monster? The one that looked like an alien?”

An-hyeon gave a slight nod but turned his head away, unwilling to say more. Understanding his feelings, Woo Jeong-min gave a bitter smile and quietly joined Seon Yu-un and Won Hye-su at their table. Cheon Seung-hyeon followed, plopping into a nearby chair and stretching dramatically.

“Ugh, finally off that cold stone floor and onto a chair. Feels like I’m alive again. So, those guys ran into that monster too?”

“Seung-hyeon, don’t talk so loudly. It’s similar to when we lost Jin-tae.”

“Then they’re 100% dead. What a shame. I wanted to give that guy a piece of my mind for that new setup or whatever. By the way, Hye-su…”

Cheon Seung-hyeon stopped mid-sentence under Seon Yu-un’s sharp glare. But Won Hye-su seemed to have heard her name called. She lifted her head briefly and spoke in a weary voice.

“Whether he’s dead or not, it’s got nothing to do with me. Honestly, it’s a bit disappointing. I wanted him to feel the pain I went through, but now he’s the one gone.”

Her words nearly set Yu-jeong off, but Jeong-min fixed her with a cold stare and spoke in a heavy tone.

“Don’t talk about people so carelessly.”

“I said it’s got nothing to do with me. Did I say anything wrong?”

“Then why say you wanted that guy to feel your pain? We lost Jin-tae, and you lost your sister. If you know the pain of losing someone dear, shouldn’t you at least offer comfort instead of speaking so callously?”

“That’s…”

As Won Hye-su hesitated, Jeong-min snorted and continued.

“If you’ve got nothing to say, keep your mouth shut. I’ll say it again: that guy’s death has no connection to Hae-yeon’s.”

“Jeong-min, Hye-su, that’s enough,” Seon Yu-un interjected, trying to mediate as the atmosphere grew tense. But the two continued glaring at each other, Hye-su biting her lip as if holding back some deep resentment.

Aside from Yu-jeong, An-hyeon’s party had no interest in their argument. Their eyes remained fixed on the staircase. As time passed and survivors began to be teleported in earnest, the second floor grew increasingly noisy.

Voices of joy, sorrow, and chatter mixed together. Other survivors started descending from the second floor in groups, opening the door one by one. When the door opened again, two more figures stepped out.

The next person to appear was someone An-hyeon’s party knew as well.

It was Park Dong-geol.

---

The sensation of mana coursing through every corner of my body was indescribably refreshing. Thanks to Hwa-jeong, even the finest meridians in my fingers and toes had been cleared, amplifying the pleasure. As I calmly observed my inner state, I could confirm that both the quantity and quality of my mana had improved significantly. But that wasn’t all.

All impurities and blockages in my body had been cleared, and my physique had transformed into one optimized for wielding mana. This meant that even if I swung my sword with the same force as another User with similar abilities, I would have the upper hand.

However, fully harnessing Hwa-jeong’s power was still a distant goal. My stamina, at 70 points, was a significant obstacle. Seraph had told me that the minimum requirement to use Hwa-jeong’s power was 90 stamina points, and to wield it fully, I’d need at least 101 points. (I was genuinely shocked when I heard this. The gap between 99 and 100 points is vast, and the difference between 100 and 101 is even more staggering.)

With my current 70 stamina points, pouring my full strength into it would likely cause my body to collapse. After calculating all the points I could reliably earn early on, I arrived at a total of 14 points: 2 from the boss monster, 2 from a stamina-enhancing elixir, 6 from the Tears of the Angel, and 4 from the mission reward upon graduating from the User Academy. I knew I should invest all these points into stamina, but a part of me couldn’t help but feel greedy.

In the Hall Plane, an average stat of 60 means you can hold your own on any continent. The higher your stats climb—70, 80, 90—the more valuable you become as a User. Especially when a stat exceeds 90, each additional point becomes exponentially more precious.

This fueled my greed. My current stats were:

[Strength 94] [Endurance 92] [Agility 98] [Stamina 70] [Magic 96] [Luck 88]

Excluding the 2 points for stamina, I had 12 points left. If I invested 4 points in Strength, 3 in Agility, and 5 in Magic, I could raise two stats to 101 and bring Strength to 98. If Seraph knew what I was considering, she’d probably foam at the mouth.

Stamina is the foundation of all stats. Without a sturdy foundation, no matter how high your other stats are, you’ll struggle to maximize their efficiency. I knew rationally that this was a bad idea, but the thought of “what if” kept nagging at me.

For now, I decided to clear my mind. My plan was to enter the Hall Plane, join the User Academy, and train my stamina relentlessly for three months. The chances of raising even a single point were slim, but I wanted to grasp at any straw. Building my stamina now would save me points later.

After carefully channeling the mana throughout my body, I quietly opened my eyes. I wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but it was likely more than a day. Turning my head, I saw that the portal to the Hall Plane was already open. Feeling a bit foolish, I spoke to Seraph, who was quietly watching me.

“…The teleportation has already started?”

“Yes. Most have already been teleported, and only User Kim Su-hyeon remains.”

“You could’ve said something.”

“You seemed deep in thought, almost meditating, so I didn’t want to interrupt. There’s no need to worry; there’s still time.”

I was annoyed, as I’d wanted to arrive early to talk with the others and clear up any misunderstandings. But I stood up without complaint and walked toward the portal to the Hall Plane.

I didn’t bother with a formal goodbye to Seraph. We’d see each other plenty in the future, so it felt unnecessary. But Seraph seemed to think otherwise, as her voice caught me just as I was about to step through.

“User Kim Su-hyeon.”

“What?”

I answered without turning, one foot already in the portal.

“Please take care of yourself. If there’s a need to contact you, I’ll send a revelation through the temple.”

I gave a curt nod and stepped into the shimmering blue portal.
