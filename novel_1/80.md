# Chapter 79: New Face

Vivian blended into our group quite well—at least on the surface. Her peculiarly naive behavior, the contract, and her actions so far had softened the group’s wariness toward her, at the very least. However, while the others, who had been through thick and thin together since the Rite of Passage, got along without restraint, Vivian hadn’t quite reached that level of camaraderie.

If anything, it might be more accurate to say she was being picked on. During morning training, when everyone else was immersed in sensory practice, I’d occasionally catch sight of her crouching alone in a corner, wiping away tears. But the moment I called out to her, she’d hide her distress as if she’d never been crying and come running over with quick, pattering steps. Whenever she looked at me with tear-streaked cheeks, my heart ached.

I could roughly guess the reason for her tears, but for now, I decided to let it be. They say there’s a world of dynamics among women, and if I meddled carelessly, it might only worsen the way the others viewed her.

Still, it was a small comfort to see An-sol occasionally casting sympathetic glances at Vivian, as if she felt sorry for her. At the same time, Yu-jeong would often look at Vivian with a subtle, unreadable expression, and Vivian would instinctively lower her head in response.

Yu-jeong was incredibly sharp—her perceptiveness was second to none. During our one-on-one training sessions, she seemed to have noticed that I paid a bit more attention to An-hyeon. When it was just me and An-hyeon, she’d act sweet and friendly, but when it was just her, An-sol, and Vivian, she took on the role of the domineering older sister. Vivian, in particular, was an easy target for Yu-jeong’s schemes. Watching Yu-jeong expertly wield the contract from before, I could only give a wry smile.

Still, I didn’t let it slide completely.

“You’d better be careful,” I said.

“Huh? What do you mean, Oppa?” Yu-jeong tilted her head, feigning innocence with a look that screamed, *I didn’t do anything. I don’t know what you’re talking about.*

I leaned in and whispered, “Vivian’s a highly skilled mage. Right now, she’s still recovering her intellect and has a childlike side, so she’s letting it slide. But what are you going to do later?”

“There’s the contract,” she replied confidently.

The moment she said it, her face shifted to an “Oops” expression, and she quickly covered her mouth. I chuckled briefly before continuing.

“Right now, Vivian’s practically a child. Even if it’s recovery, her personality could still be shaped by her surroundings. Sure, there’s the contract, but you’re not the one who wrote it, so it’s not absolute. And most importantly, don’t forget that Vivian has free will. If she fully regains her intellect later…”

“Ho ho, Oppa, you’re making me out to be the bad guy. This is all part of the process,” Yu-jeong said, brushing it off.

“Who’s saying otherwise? I’m just worried, that’s all. Keep it up.”

I gave her shoulder a reassuring pat. Her eyes were smiling, but her lips weren’t. She was probably calculating my words at lightning speed in her head. Being as clever as she was, she’d likely understood the warning I was trying to convey.

Coincidentally, that same day, Vivian proved my point when we went outside the city to fight monsters. We encountered a group of goblins on the plains, and she unleashed her full potential right in front of Yu-jeong, activating her special ability.

“Aura, Aranya! The web of death that commands the 32nd Legion!”

I’d been curious about what it meant to be the master of the 66th Beast Legion, but watching Vivian in action, a certain class came to mind.

*Aura! Agnes! The ruler of flames that commands the 24th Legion!*

It reminded me of the Secret Class, Spirit Summoner, from my first cycle. During the battle to reclaim Atlanta, I’d witnessed a Spirit Summoner call forth an entire legion of spirits to face off against the Grand Duke of Hell’s forces—a truly spectacular sight. Though there was a difference between Secret and Rare Classes, the Chimera Alchemist’s ability to summon and enhance chimeras or otherworldly beasts bore a striking resemblance.

Putting that aside, the power of the Chimera Alchemist was undeniably impressive. Perhaps due to the immense stress from Yu-jeong’s teasing, Vivian fought with a ferocious, almost murderous expression, slaughtering monsters with abandon. After wiping them out single-handedly, she’d revert to her usual naive smile, giggling innocently. I could see Yu-jeong’s throat bob as she swallowed hard, watching the display.

I couldn’t help but let out a sound of admiration as I saw Vivian use summoning circles, a hallmark of alchemical magic, in combat.

I’d been slightly worried about her, given her low rank in orthodox magic despite her high magical power stat and the fact that her alchemical magic wasn’t particularly combat-oriented. But she dispelled those concerns in an instant, as if mocking my doubts. With just the master of the 66th Beast Legion, she demonstrated the prowess of a one-woman army. Moreover, she could support the party and her summons with orthodox magic, making her an all-purpose mage.

From that point on, Yu-jeong’s teasing seemed to lessen. Occasionally, she’d even act friendly and chat with Vivian. Watching Yu-jeong’s clever maneuvering, I couldn’t help but be impressed. Vivian, oblivious to it all, simply nodded eagerly, delighted by Yu-jeong’s changed demeanor.

The group was growing day by day, and I couldn’t afford to stand still either. As the one making all the major decisions and leading the group, with the others and Vivian trusting and following me, I had a duty to exceed their expectations.

---

It was early evening. After returning from a battle outside the city, the group dragged their tired bodies back to the inn. They cleaned the monster blood off their gear, washed up briefly, and gathered around a table in the first-floor lobby.

“Ugh, so annoying,” Yu-jeong muttered, slamming her head onto the table while waiting for the food they’d ordered.

“What’s so annoying?” An-hyeon asked.

Yu-jeong lazily curled her fingers, pointing at the surrounding tables one by one. “We’re not celebrities or anything, but people keep sneaking glances at us the moment we sit down. It’s irritating. If they’ve got something to say, they should just come over.”

Her sharp tone made An-hyeon let out a soft grunt and nod in agreement.

“Hmm. Well, our Sol is pretty cute, so it makes sense.”

“Oh, come on, Oppa! Don’t say stuff like that!” An-sol shot him a playful glare, scolding him. An-hyeon just grinned foolishly, clearly finding her reaction adorable. It wasn’t an unfamiliar sight, so Yu-jeong let out a deep sigh and closed her eyes.

Even to me, it was clear our group drew a lot of attention, though not necessarily in a good way. Until recently, we’d been wearing beginner User Academy gear, but after a brief absence, we’d returned looking noticeably sharper. Anyone with a bit of sense could tell we’d hit it big on a single expedition. Of course, considering that eighty percent of the stares came from male users, there was definitely some ulterior motive mixed in. After all, Yu-jeong, Sol, and Vivian each exuded a unique charm and beauty.

“You all worked hard. Your food is ready,” Go Yeon-ju said, approaching our table with the dishes. As she neared, An-hyeon straightened up from his slouched posture. Seeing this, Go Yeon-ju gave a gentle, amused smile, then began setting the food on the table with a refined demeanor—a stark contrast to her past behavior.

“It’s probably tough for you today, too,” I remarked.

“As the owner, a busy business is a good thing. This time of day always has a few users around, so…” She trailed off, noticing my glance around the room, and responded in a soft voice.

Just then, An-hyeon, who’d been quietly listening, stood up abruptly. “Let me help,” he said, his voice deep and serious, as he began assisting Go Yeon-ju with the dishes.

She glanced at me, but I just shook my head with a blank expression. I caught her letting out a small sigh.

“You’re quite the gentleman. Thank you,” she said.

“Ahem, it’s nothing. It’s only natural to help,” An-hyeon replied, puffing up slightly.

“It’d be nice if everyone was this kind…”

I deliberately ignored her comment, pulling out a cigarette and lighting it. If it were just the two of us late at night, I might’ve indulged her playful banter, but with the group watching, I wasn’t in the mood. Her eyes sparkled with mischief, and I had no intention of getting dragged into something unnecessary. But that was just my assumption.

When I turned my head, Go Yeon-ju flashed an enigmatic smile, stepped in front of me, and crouched down, forcing eye contact. As I furrowed my brow and opened my mouth to protest, she leaned in close, her face inches from mine.

“…What are you doing?”

If I pulled my pants down right now, it’d look like *that* kind of scene. With the group watching, I was about to slide my chair back to avoid the awkwardness, but she quickly grabbed it with both hands. Then, sticking her head between my legs, she whispered in a low voice.

“Two users came looking for you this afternoon.”

“…Okay.”

“I told them you’d be back around evening, and they said they’d return then. They were those mage users you’ve seen before. You remember them, right?”

At that moment, Yu-jeong’s voice cut through. “Hey, what are you doing? Oppa, what’s going on?”

I took a deep breath and nodded. Go Yeon-ju gave a faint smile, stood up from her crouched position, and stepped back. An-hyeon looked at me with envy, while Yu-jeong and the other female users stared with ambiguous expressions. Feeling unjustly targeted, I spoke in a sarcastic tone.

“You could’ve just said that in a normal position.”

“Oh my, I was just resting for a moment because I’m tired. Did you imagine something weird?” she teased.

“Let’s just eat,” I muttered.

Go Yeon-ju giggled at my response, then turned and headed back to the kitchen. Immediately after, I heard Yu-jeong’s voice shouting, “What’s with that woman? So annoying! You agree, right, Vivian?” followed by Vivian’s reluctant agreement.

The food arrived, and Go Yeon-ju’s cooking was, as expected, excellent. Vivian, apparently starving, eagerly picked up her fork, but Yu-jeong swiftly smacked it with a quick, deft motion. The fork clattered onto the table, and as Vivian stared blankly, mouth agape, Yu-jeong’s sharp voice followed.

“What did I tell you?”

“Hng…”

“I said no touching the utensils until Oppa starts eating.”

“S-sorry… I was just so hungry…”

“No excuses. Did you do well, or did you mess up?”

“I messed up… *sob*.”

“Ugh, crying again? I’ll let it slide this time. Don’t do it again.”

Watching Yu-jeong scold Vivian yet again, I sighed, picked up my spoon, and started eating. Only then did Yu-jeong nod approvingly, allowing Vivian to cautiously pick up her fork again. She looked so pitiful with her head bowed that I scooped a generous portion of the tastiest meat and placed it on her plate.

“Vivian, you worked hard today. Eat up, and let’s do our best tomorrow, too.”

At my warm words, Vivian’s face lit up, and she nodded enthusiastically. “Yes!”

“Vivian?” Yu-jeong interjected, her tone sharp again.

Vivian quickly corrected herself. “Th-thank you…”

An-sol watched the scene with a hint of envy, prompting An-hyeon to mimic me and place some food on her plate. However, An-sol calmly returned the food to its original spot with a composed expression.

After watching An-hyeon’s dejected reaction, I swallowed the food in my mouth and spoke again. “Just let her eat in peace. This isn’t a military camp. Why are you so obsessed with controlling everything?”

“Hmph. You wouldn’t get it, Oppa. All you ever say is ‘Sol’s so pretty, so pretty,’ and now it’s ‘Vivian’s so nice, so nice,’” Yu-jeong retorted, turning her head with a huff.

I sighed as Vivian giggled with a mischievous expression, happily eating the meat I’d given her.

For a while, the group focused on their meal. An-hyeon, who’d been picking at his food with a gloomy expression, kept glancing toward the kitchen, likely thinking of Go Yeon-ju. But then, as if something occurred to him, he turned to me.

“Hyung.”

“What?”

“You seemed pretty close with the lady who runs the inn earlier. What were you talking about?”

Calling her the “lady who runs the inn” with such unnecessary formality made me chuckle. I casually mentioned that some users we’d met before had come looking for us that afternoon. The noisy table fell silent instantly, as if everyone’s curiosity had been piqued. They always got quiet as a mouse when something interesting came up—wish they’d be like that more often.

“So they might come back tonight. I liked that older sister, but the guy seemed kind of dim, so not really my type,” Yu-jeong said.

“You might be the older sister,” An-hyeon teased.

“What?” Yu-jeong bristled.

An-hyeon smirked at her before turning back to me. An-sol gave an awkward smile, while Vivian outwardly tried to calm Yu-jeong down, though I noticed a faint smirk tugging at her lips.

Just as I was about to take another bite, An-hyeon called out to me again.
