# Chapter 111: A Dark Past

It took three days to reach our destination after setting out on the expedition, two days to explore the Ruined Laboratory, and another three days to return to Mul. In total, it took eight days to complete our journey. We arrived just past noon, and as we approached, other users who had finished exploring the outskirts of the city glanced at us curiously as they passed by. Likely, our ragged appearances piqued their interest about where we had been.

Despite our disheveled state, everyone’s faces were bright. The expedition had yielded significant rewards, and the group exuded the triumphant air of returning generals. As the weathered northern gate of Mul came into view, Yu-jeong’s face lit up with excitement as she spoke.

“Ugh… finally back. I can’t wait to get inside, eat some warm food, wash up, and crash in bed.”

“Hehe, me too…” An-sol replied with a shy smile.

An-hyeon, overhearing their conversation, put on a stern expression. With his shoulders squared and his neck stiff, it was easy to guess what he was thinking. I decided to tease him a little.

“An-hyeon, what’s the first thing you’ll do when we get back?” I asked, sidling up to him.

He responded with a serious face, “Of course, I’ll start with training. Thinking about eating, playing, or sleeping right after an expedition is the wrong mindset.”

“Very commendable attitude. Truly worthy of a Rare Class,” I said, nodding.

“Heh, isn’t this level of discipline pretty standard?” An-hyeon replied, shaking his head with a smug look.

Beside him, Yu-jeong and An-sol glared at him intensely. Unable to tolerate his self-satisfied expression any longer, Yu-jeong finally snapped.

“Yeah, right. You’ll train, my foot. You’ll probably just stuff your face like a pig.”

Despite her sharp jab, An-hyeon remained unfazed, his face the picture of calm.

“Hmm. I smell the stench of a common user nearby. A particularly ugly scent, mixed with jealousy. I think I’ll move to sit between Hyung and Vivian.”

His lofty tone only fueled Yu-jeong’s irritation, her eyes practically sparking with anger.

“Crazy jerk. Idiot,” she muttered.

“I hear the cries of a jealous beast somewhere. Hyung, by the way, the weather’s especially clear today, isn’t it? Haha.”

“Alright, alright, both of you, enough,” I interjected.

An-hyeon nodded with a relaxed smile, while Yu-jeong bit her lip, grinding her teeth. I waved my hand to diffuse the tension, as I had only meant to poke at them lightly. Shin Sang-yong and Vivian chuckled quietly at the scene.

My gaze shifted to Jeong Ha-yeon. Since leaving the Ruined Laboratory, she had been noticeably subdued. The others hadn’t engaged her much, and she rarely spoke first. Even Yu-jeong, who had been close to her, now treated her as if she were invisible.

It wasn’t exactly a positive atmosphere. Regardless of how I felt about it, Jeong Ha-yeon was someone I had chosen to join my future clan. While expecting a familial bond right away might be unrealistic, we needed to at least recapture the camaraderie we had when we first met in Mul before setting out. Moreover, since I planned to apply for clan establishment after this expedition, she would technically be one of the founding members.

For now, it seemed best to let everyone rest today and address the issue with her later. There was plenty to do before the next expedition, but with enough time, we could tackle everything step by step. The stay in Mul was planned to be a long one for rest and preparation.

Suppressing my fatigue, I passed through the northern gate, hearing the loud salutes of the guards. My first destination was an inn.

In the small city of Mul, I always chose the same inn: *The Modest Lady*. The facilities weren’t exceptional, but it was rarely crowded (except for the users pestering Go Yeon-ju), and the food was decent. Of course, those were just surface reasons. My true motive for choosing this inn was to either recruit or deal with Go Yeon-ju. Come to think of it, the time to confront her was drawing near.

In the worst-case scenario, I might have to face her alone in combat. Hoping it wouldn’t come to that, I climbed the inn’s stairs.

As I opened the tightly shut wooden door, I caught sight of Go Yeon-ju’s back as she cleaned a table. 

*Gulp.*

That was An-hyeon swallowing hard. She must have sensed our presence, as she casually finished wiping the table and turned around. Upon recognizing me, she greeted me warmly.

“Oh, it’s been a while!”

“Likewise,” I replied.

Stepping into *The Modest Lady*, I noticed the inn was nearly empty, with only a few users around. I recalled that a major purge of vagrants was likely to happen within the month. Though still in the planning stages, some users who had caught wind of it were already leaving the northern cities.

Go Yeon-ju was dressed, as usual, in revealing clothing—a V-neck top exposing much of her chest and shorts that barely reached above her knees, showing off her smooth thighs. She clasped her hands together, her face lighting up with genuine delight at seeing us.

“Would you like to eat first… or perhaps a bath? Or maybe… me?” she teased.

I cut her off with a tired tone. “Food first, then a bath. We’ll take three special rooms for two weeks. Prepare the usual meal.”

“Tch,” she clicked her tongue, but I ignored it.

Feeling An-hyeon’s silent protest from beside me, we settled at a nearby table. The group sat heavily, the chairs creaking under their weight, and they let out collective sighs of relief.

“Phew… hey, Su-hyeon,” An-hyeon started.

“What?”

“Why three rooms? Two would’ve been enough.”

“I need one for some personal matters. The special rooms have space for work.”

Vivian tilted her head curiously at my response. I planned to use one of the special rooms myself. There was a lot to handle, but more importantly, I needed a private workspace.

After seeing the elixir in the wooden box, I had a hunch. If my guess was correct, I could potentially raise my stamina stat by at least one point.

Lost in thought, I shook my head. I had promised myself to rest and recover today, yet here I was, already thinking about work. It seemed I couldn’t shake the habits from my first cycle, where I constantly pushed myself to the limit.

The group had slumped over the table, their heads resting on their arms. The accumulated fatigue from the battles and the grueling march back to Mul had clearly hit them all at once. Since we were now in the safety of the city, I let them be without comment.

Soon, Go Yeon-ju emerged with plates of food.

“Oppa, can I have just one drink?” Yu-jeong asked.

“…Just one,” I permitted.

Her request seemed to spark interest among the others, who ordered drinks to their taste. Feeling parched myself, I joined them.

The meal was quick and quiet. Everyone ate swiftly, eager to fill their stomachs and head upstairs to rest.

After eating, the female users opted for baths, while the male users headed straight to their rooms. I paid Go Yeon-ju, took a quick wash, and entered the special room where An-hyeon and Shin Sang-yong were staying. Both were already fast asleep, snoring loudly. An-hyeon, who had boasted about training, was drooling and had kicked off his blankets. I clicked my tongue, covered him back up, and settled into the remaining bed.

---

“Ugh.”

Despite my resolve to rest, I found myself sitting up. The window showed the sky had darkened. I tried to lie back down and sleep, but within a minute, I was out of bed again.

Old habits die hard. Even when I tried to change, my body moved on its own. I had hoped to sleep deeply for once, but my body was too accustomed to minimal rest. The worst part was that, while I recognized this as a problem, a part of me saw it as necessary.

It had been about three or four hours since I lay down—longer than my usual naps, but still far from enough. I knew that pushing myself like this could lead to serious injury one day.

Stats aren’t everything. You can push through when needed, but rest is crucial to function at your best. Knowing this, I still reached for the sword I had placed nearby. Moving my body or calming my mind seemed the only way to settle my restless thoughts.

I glanced at An-hyeon, who had once again kicked off his blanket, exposing his stomach. Shaking my head, I adjusted his clothes and tucked him in properly. Sometimes, I felt more like a parent than a leader.

Leaving the sleeping duo, I turned the doorknob. The door’s creak seemed unusually loud today. I closed it softly and headed to the empty special room.

The special rooms on this floor were unoccupied except by our group. Most users had no reason—or means—to rent them in Mul.

Planning to swing my sword or meditate, I opened the door to the extra special room.

“Oh.”

“You came, as expected.”

“…What are you doing here alone?” I asked, bemused.

Jeong Ha-yeon tilted her head slightly. Inside the room, which I had intended to use for work, she sat neatly as always. A bottle of liquor and a plate of stir-fried vegetables were on the table, suggesting she had brought them herself. As I stared at her, she shrugged and spoke.

“Why are you looking at me like that? Can’t I do this?”

“That’s not the issue. Well, I suppose there’s no rule against it.”

“Hehe. Don’t be so stiff. Come in and sit. I was just thinking how pathetic it is to drink alone, and you showed up at the perfect time.”

On the surface, she seemed like her usual self. I pulled out the chair across from her and sat down. After confirming I was seated, she casually took a sip of her drink.

“I got kicked out,” she said suddenly.

“…”

“…Kidding. They wouldn’t do that. So, don’t make that face.”

Her voice carried a slight hint of intoxication. My immediate frown at her “kicked out” comment prompted a quick smile and correction. She continued, almost as if venting.

“But the atmosphere is a bit uncomfortable. I know it’s my own doing, so I can’t complain.”

As I suspected, there was an underlying tension. I made a mental note to talk to Yu-jeong soon. But that wasn’t the priority right now.

She had clearly said, “You came, as expected,” meaning she had anticipated my visit. Though we hadn’t spent much time together, my routine was consistent. Still, her prediction that I’d come here tonight was a bold guess.

As I remained silent, she filled an empty glass with liquor and handed it to me. I accepted it with a wry expression. Before drinking, I asked calmly, “What would you have done if I hadn’t come?”

“Well, I thought there was a good chance you would. If you didn’t, I’d just sleep alone—nice and cozy. Either way, it’s not a bad outcome. That’s the mindset of a Hall Plane mage.”

Her voice, usually clear, carried a seductive undertone. When I hesitated with the glass, she nodded slightly, urging me to drink. I used my Third Eye to analyze the liquid’s contents before downing it in one go.

“Bold move. That’s not exactly weak stuff,” she remarked.

Noticing her evasive tone, I cut in quietly, “Just so you know, I don’t like it when people beat around the bush.”

“…Maybe the liquor’s making me a bit sentimental. I’m tipsy, so bear with me.”

Despite my blunt words, she only smiled beautifully. But my gaze remained impassive. I could tell instinctively—she wasn’t drunk. Her face didn’t show the signs. Which meant she was acting for some reason.

She spoke first.

“…Su-hyeon-ssi.”

“Go ahead.”

“Do you have time tonight…?”

She called my name, resting her chin on one hand. Her sleepy eyes met mine. In the dark night, in a room with just the two of us, separated only by a table, I could hear her soft breaths and the occasional sweet sigh.

After staring into my eyes for a while, she slowly parted her delicate lips.

“If you have time… would you listen to my story tonight?”
