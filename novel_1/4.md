# Chapter 1: The Starting Point

The air was heavy, thick with the scent of dust and something faintly metallic. Kim Su-hyeon stood in the center of the Summoning Room, his breath shallow as the weight of his past life pressed against his chest. The walls, carved with intricate runes that pulsed faintly with an otherworldly light, seemed to hum with a quiet, expectant energy. He clenched his fists, the familiar calluses of a swordsman grounding him as memories of his ten years in the Hall Plane flooded back—years of blood, betrayal, and survival, all undone by the Zero Code’s impossible power.

Around him, the others stirred, their faces a mix of confusion and fear. New users, freshly summoned from Earth, their eyes wide as they took in the alien chamber. An-hyeon, his younger brother, stood closest, his broad shoulders tense, his gaze darting between the glowing runes and Su-hyeon’s calm demeanor. An-sol, their younger sister, clung to An-hyeon’s arm, her delicate frame trembling, her high Magic and Luck stats still dormant, untested. Lee Bo-rim, the former bank teller, adjusted her glasses nervously, her practical mind already trying to make sense of the impossible. Park Dong-geol, aggressive and impatient, cracked his knuckles, his scowl daring anyone to speak first. Lee Sin-u, young and timid, shrank back, his eyes fixed on the floor. Lee Yu-jeong, outspoken and sharp-tongued, crossed her arms, her defiance masking her uncertainty. Kim Han-byeol, calm and observant, stood apart, her Jewel Mage potential hidden behind a composed exterior.

A voice broke the silence, clear and resonant, cutting through the murmurs like a blade. Seraph, the angelic guide, materialized in a shimmer of light, her wings folded neatly behind her, her expression serene yet unyielding. “Welcome, users, to the Hall Plane,” she said, her voice carrying an authority that silenced the room. “You have been summoned to undertake the Rite of Passage, a trial to prove your worth for entry into this world. Survive, and you will gain the right to exist here. Fail, and you will perish.”

Su-hyeon’s jaw tightened. He knew this speech, had lived its consequences. The Rite of Passage was no mere test—it was a crucible, designed to break the weak and forge the survivors into something more. He glanced at An-hyeon, who met his eyes with a nod, their unspoken bond as brothers anchoring them. An-sol’s grip on An-hyeon’s arm tightened, her intuition already sensing the danger ahead.

Seraph’s gaze swept over them, lingering on Su-hyeon for a fraction longer than the others, as if sensing the weight of his past. “You will be transported to the starting point,” she continued. “Your task is simple: survive the forest and reach the safe zone within seven days. The system will guide you, but your choices are your own. Begin.”

The runes flared, and the floor beneath them shuddered. A blinding light enveloped the group, and Su-hyeon felt the familiar pull of spatial transfer, like being yanked through a void. When the light faded, they stood in a dense forest, the air thick with the chirping of insects and the rustle of leaves. The sky above was a muted gray, casting long shadows through the towering trees.

“Stay close,” Su-hyeon said, his voice low but firm, slipping naturally into the role of leader. The others hesitated, their inexperience palpable, but An-hyeon stepped forward, his trust in his brother absolute. “What’s the plan, hyung?” he asked, his tone steady despite the tension in his posture.

Su-hyeon scanned the forest, his Mind’s Eye already picking out subtle details—the faint claw marks on a nearby tree, the unnatural stillness in one direction. “We move north,” he said. “There’s a clearing that way, safer for now. Avoid the eastern path; it’s crawling with Mangi apes.” His knowledge, hard-earned from a decade of survival, gave his words an unshakable certainty.

Lee Yu-jeong raised an eyebrow, her voice sharp. “And how do you know that? You been here before or something?” Her skepticism was met with a cold glance from Su-hyeon, who didn’t bother responding. Park Dong-geol snorted, muttering, “Bossy bastard,” but fell in line as the group began to move.

The forest was alive with danger. Su-hyeon’s senses, honed by years of close-quarters combat, caught the faint snap of a twig. He raised a hand, halting the group. “Quiet,” he whispered, his eyes narrowing as he activated The Third Eye. Through the underbrush, he glimpsed movement—a pack of Deadmen, their decayed flesh hanging loosely, their hollow eyes glinting with hunger. The zombie-like monsters were slow but relentless, and their numbers could overwhelm the unprepared.

“Deadmen,” Su-hyeon said, his voice calm but urgent. “Stay behind me. An-hyeon, guard An-sol and Han-byeol. Bo-rim, Yu-jeong, watch the flanks. Sin-u, Dong-geol, back me up.” His commands were precise, leaving no room for argument. The group tensed, their inexperience making their movements clumsy, but they obeyed.

The Deadmen shambled forward, their guttural moans filling the air. Su-hyeon drew the Formless Sword, its invisible blade humming faintly as he channeled Ki into it. With a single, fluid motion, he stepped forward, his sword slicing through the first Deadman’s neck with surgical precision. The creature collapsed, its head rolling into the underbrush. The others lunged, but Su-hyeon was already moving, his Mind and Sword as One technique making his strikes a blur of deadly efficiency. Two more Deadmen fell before they could react, their bodies crumpling to the forest floor.

An-hyeon, wielding a scavenged spear, drove it through a Deadman’s chest, pinning it to a tree. An-sol, her hands trembling, muttered a faint incantation, her latent Magic stat sparking a weak barrier that slowed another creature’s advance. Kim Han-byeol, her composure unbroken, tossed a small jewel that exploded into a burst of light, disorienting the remaining Deadmen. Lee Yu-jeong and Lee Bo-rim held their ground, using makeshift weapons to fend off stragglers, while Lee Sin-u cowered, barely managing to swing a branch. Park Dong-geol, reckless but effective, tackled a Deadman, smashing its skull with a rock.

Within minutes, the pack was dispatched, the forest quiet once more. Su-hyeon wiped the ichor from his blade, his expression unreadable. “Move,” he said, not waiting for the others to process the fight. “We’re not safe yet.”

As they pressed deeper into the forest, Su-hyeon’s mind churned. The Zero Code, the item that had rewound his life, was both a gift and a burden. He had a second chance to protect those he’d lost—An-hyeon, An-sol, and others who had fallen in his first life. But the Hall Plane was unforgiving, and the Rite of Passage was only the beginning. The Golden Lion Clan, the Red Fang Clan, the demons like Astaroth and Belphegor, the looming shadow of the Steel Mountains—all lay ahead, waiting to test him again.

An-sol’s voice, soft and hesitant, broke his thoughts. “Oppa, how did you know what to do?” Her wide eyes searched his face, seeking reassurance. Su-hyeon forced a small smile, the kind he’d used to comfort her in their childhood. “Just trust me, Sol-ah,” he said, ruffling her hair. “I’ve got this.”

The group reached the clearing as dusk settled, the sky now a deep indigo. Su-hyeon scanned the area, satisfied it was free of immediate threats. “We rest here tonight,” he said. “Set up camp, but keep watch. Mangi or Wraiths could still show up.” The others nodded, their exhaustion tempered by the adrenaline of survival.

As they set up a makeshift camp, Su-hyeon stood apart, his gaze fixed on the horizon. The Hall Plane was a world of endless trials, but with the Zero Code’s power and his hard-won knowledge, he would carve a different path this time. For An-hyeon, for An-sol, for himself.
