# Chapter 18: Split in Half

In front of the cairn, a fair number of Deadmen lay fallen. Each had an arrow lodged in its forehead, and I counted about seven bodies. Still, there were easily more than twice that number remaining, trampling over their fallen comrades’ corpses in a desperate attempt to take a bite out of me.

“Keep trying, keep trying,” I hummed, reaching into my quiver for another arrow, only to find it empty. My hand stirred nothing but air, scraping the bottom until I finally pulled out two deeply nestled arrows. It seemed I’d need to collect the ones I’d already shot on my way back.

Not all the Deadmen had gathered yet. I could see more shambling toward me from a distance, but it felt like the right time to pull back. Even if three or four stragglers targeted the group, An-hyeon could handle them alone without issue.

Looking down, I saw the Deadmen below, mouths agape, shaking their heads back and forth, howling in a frenzy. The sight was amusing, and I couldn’t help but nod along, mimicking their rhythm.

*What am I doing?*

A wry smile crept onto my face, and I instinctively covered my mouth. I was getting too caught up in the moment. Back in my first cycle in the Hall Plane, after reaching Sword Master status, I rarely let my emotions sway me. Especially before a battle, I always strove to be as cold and composed as ice. That discipline had carried me through the toughest fights—like the Battle to Retake Atlanta and the Ragnarok Siege.

This feeling was something I hadn’t experienced in a long time. Even facing an overwhelmingly superior allied army, I hadn’t flinched. Yet here I was, swept up by the thrill of slaughter, unable to control it. Though the situation wasn’t as dire as back then, an eager, exhilarating anticipation coursed through my entire body.

The more I looked at the monsters from atop the cairn, the more my primal instincts surged, threatening to burst. I leaped down toward the inner forest, trying to calm myself with the thought of holding back just a little longer. The Deadmen, struggling to climb the cairn, let out loud wails. They seemed furious that I’d descended just as they’d finally made it up.

“Hey, kids. Too many eyes here to finish the job. Let’s head a bit deeper inside.”

*Grargh!*

I wasn’t sure if they understood, but the Deadmen growled and followed. I deliberately slowed my pace as I entered the forest. My original plan was to sprint at full speed and create distance, but I changed my mind. I’d let them keep up, ensuring they didn’t lose sight of me.

They must have been starving, because as soon as I climbed the cairn, I saw a Deadman tumble clumsily down. I casually fired my crossbow at the one that had scrambled up most eagerly. Its head pierced by an arrow, it collapsed, still hungry. Confirming its fall, I turned and continued into the forest.

*Grargh! Grargh! Grargh! Grargh! Grargh!*

The growls were starting to feel familiar. As I ran, adjusting my speed to keep them tantalizingly close, their frustration was palpable. The sound of their teeth chattering right behind me added a peculiar thrill. Then it happened.

*Crunch!*

“Ugh.”

I’d gotten too carried away. While weaving an S-pattern through the trees, I felt something clamp down hard on my left arm. Startled, I glanced over to see a Deadman with a grotesque face biting my wrist. It wasn’t one of the ones I’d lured—probably just a straggler that got lucky and crossed my path.

It didn’t hurt much, but the shock of being bitten by such a creature was overwhelming. That shock quickly turned to anger. Even if it was luck, my pride was wounded. I glared at the Deadman gnawing on my wrist and snapped, “What are you looking at?”

*Grargh.*

“You startled me… you bastard.”

Its eyes were strange—it had bitten me, but its teeth couldn’t pierce my skin. Of course they couldn’t. Did it really think it could chew through my body, with a durability stat of 92 points? With a curse, I swung my right hand in anger, and its head exploded with a *pop*.

While I was tangled up with that one, the Deadmen chasing me caught up, surrounding me in layers. Some grinned, as if they thought they’d cornered their prey. Gauging the distance I’d covered, I figured it was fine and lightly shook out my wrist.

*Grargh. Grargh. Grargh. Grargh. Grargh. Grargh. Grargh. Grargh.*

Their growls echoed from all directions, but I wasn’t afraid. Compared to the Hellhounds I’d faced when I fell into the abyss, these were practically cuddly. Still, I desperately hoped they’d satisfy even a fraction of my craving.

“Let’s make this good,” I said with a polite greeting. The Deadmen bared their teeth in response—clearly unaware of manners. I pointed my fingers at the head of the nearest one charging in. First, one down.

*Crack!*

The sensation of my fingers piercing its head wasn’t like human flesh—it was more like punching through a rotten log. As I lifted my arm, the Deadman dangled from my fingers, its body limp. The others froze at the sight.

Fear. Did these creatures, who saw humans only as food, even understand it? Could they grasp that they could be the ones hunted? I was quietly surprised. Whether it was thought or instinct, these creatures, who normally charged recklessly at prey, had paused, if only briefly, under the weight of my presence.

Impressive, but I had no intention of letting them go. I released a burst of mana, shattering the head of the Deadman in my grip, and beckoned with my fingers. Even with the signal to come at me, they took a step back.

I didn’t plan to use my longsword. It wasn’t necessary. A broken branch or even a blade of grass could become a lethal weapon in my hands. But I was thirsty for slaughter, craving the visceral feel of it. Cracking my knuckles, I let a deep smile spread across my face. A sudden realization hit me—I understood why I couldn’t stop grinning.

I was starved for my own instincts. Ten years of swinging a sword to survive, steeped in endless killing, had soaked my very nature in blood. Watching the monsters slowly retreat, I twisted my lips into a smirk.

“It looks like hyung took care of things. Everyone, get up. We need to climb that wall.”

The forest, which had been crawling with monsters moments ago, was now eerily quiet. An-hyeon spoke with a forceful tone, but the group’s mood was heavy. As he said, Kim Su-hyeon had succeeded in drawing all the nearby monsters away. The creatures that had swarmed earlier were nowhere to be seen. Yet, despite this, an inexplicable sense of despair clung to the group.

“Oppa… will he be okay? Maybe we should just go back now…” Yu-jeong said, her voice uncharacteristically subdued.

An-hyeon felt a pang in his chest but couldn’t show it. Su-hyeon hyung trusted him, had told him to protect the group. He couldn’t betray that trust.

“No way. Don’t talk nonsense—get up. What if those things come back?”

“You’re not even worried about oppa?”

“I trust hyung. He told us not to do something stupid like going back.”

At An-hyeon’s calm words, Yu-jeong fell silent. Her drained expression mirrored the helplessness creeping into An-hyeon himself. Shaking his head to clear his mind, he spoke with renewed vigor. “Let’s trust him. Just like hyung believes in us, I believe in him.”

Finishing his words, An-hyeon stepped outside, scanning the surroundings. Thankfully, not a single Deadman was in sight. An-sol cautiously followed, and Yu-jeong reluctantly stood as well. As they prepared to leave their hiding spot, Yu-jeong tapped the shoulder of Kim Han-byeol, who sat dazed.

“Hey, get up. Why are you spacing out all of a sudden?”

“…”

Kim Han-byeol didn’t respond. She glanced at Yu-jeong with her usual cold expression, then slowly stood and stepped outside. Once everyone was out, An-hyeon faced the stone wall ahead and spoke.

“Let’s do this. If we can just get over that wall, we’re out of this damn forest. We’ll move together until we reach it, and I’ll climb first. We don’t know what dangers might be waiting on the other side.”

An-sol and Yu-jeong nodded anxiously, agreeing. But Kim Han-byeol remained silent, her gaze fixed on the forest where Kim Su-hyeon had disappeared. Sensing An-hyeon’s stare, she finally turned her head and said, “Got it.”

Got what? An-hyeon sighed inwardly but kept it hidden. When hyung was around, they’d worked together smoothly, but now, without him, things felt off from the start.

“I get how you feel. I feel it too. But if we go back into the forest now, hyung’s sacrifice would be for nothing. He risked his life to give us this chance. He entrusted your safety to me. All we can do now is cross that wall and wait for him to return safely. Everyone, pull yourselves together.”

Despite his words, the group’s morale didn’t improve. Once broken, spirits don’t recover easily. An-hyeon was trying his best, but everyone stayed silent. The more he spoke, the more he realized how large Kim Su-hyeon’s absence loomed. An unexplainable unease began to simmer within him. Overwhelmed by the mounting pressure, he closed his eyes.

The rest of the group, clutching their crossbows, thought of the calm, steady man. In just half a day, Kim Su-hyeon had carved a place in their hearts. He’d gotten them out of the clearing quickly, saved An-sol from being bitten, kept the team from fracturing under Park Dong-geol’s influence, and fired arrows to protect them from monsters in every dangerous moment. At every critical juncture, he’d been their unwavering pillar, their shield.

But now, that shield was gone. He might never return. And those left behind were left grappling with the emptiness of his absence.
