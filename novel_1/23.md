# Chapter 22: The City of Traps

After a brief reunion, everyone, including me, gathered in the central living room. An-sol was nowhere to be seen, but faint breathing sounds came from the next room, suggesting she was still unconscious.

An inexplicable sense of unease hung heavily in the air. It felt like the calm before a storm. The timing of my arrival seemed unfortunate, and though it wasn’t exactly a heartwarming reunion, I hadn’t expected such a tense atmosphere, which left me feeling uneasy. An-hyeon’s awkward expression caught my eye, and I noticed Yu-jeong and Han-byeol glaring at each other, their heavy breathing hinting at a conflict sparked by some disagreement. I vaguely heard Han-byeol shouting earlier, but I decided to get the details later.

A strained silence lingered until An-hyeon, his face weary, broke it first.

“Su-hyeon hyung, I don’t know where to begin. Thanks to you, we escaped the forest, and I’m truly grateful. I’m also deeply sorry for leaving without waiting for you. I know no excuse will suffice, but I needed to say this.”

I gave a faint, inward smile as An-hyeon bowed his head. He was bold when needed but knew when to show humility. His alignment leaned toward neutrality and balance, which had worried me slightly, but he didn’t seem like a bad guy. In response to his sincere apology, I shook my head and spoke in a gentle, reassuring tone.

“When I couldn’t find you all… I’ll admit, I was a bit thrown off at first.”

“I’m sorry. I have no words.”

“You don’t need to keep apologizing. I’m sure you had your reasons. But where’s your sister?”

“Well… about that…”

“Hey, An-hyeon, hold on. Let me explain. Is that okay, oppa?”

Just as An-hyeon started to speak, Yu-jeong quickly cut him off and stepped forward. She’d already dropped formalities with me, which made me think she was quite sociable. I’d have preferred to hear it from the usually calm Han-byeol, but her furrowed brow suggested she was in a bad mood, so I nodded silently.

“So, when you led those things into the forest…” 

After confirming An-hyeon’s agreement, Yu-jeong shot a quick glare at Han-byeol before starting her explanation. Her account was lacking in some details but was clear and concise. Since I already had a rough idea of the situation, I didn’t need further elaboration. However…

“You’re saying ghost-like things appeared out of thin air?”

“Yeah, but now that I think about it, they didn’t feel exactly like ghosts. It wasn’t perfect transparency—more like a faint outline? I could vaguely make out something with wings, and I could see their movement paths. But no matter how much An-hyeon slashed at them, they wouldn’t go down.”

This part needed more detail, so I turned to An-hyeon, who closed his eyes as if recalling the moment. After tilting his head slightly, he spoke slowly.

“It’s like Yu-jeong said. I swung with all my strength, but it felt like I was cutting through air.”

Cutting through air. Visible outlines but not fully transparent. Wings. Combining these three clues, a memory flashed through my mind.

Wraiths. Hearing about translucent figures with wings, I immediately thought of wraiths. Wraiths are monsters immune to physical attacks. They inflict mental pain by passing through a person’s body, but since An-hyeon endured their attacks multiple times, it seemed the Rite of Passage had toned down their strength.

As I listened, a question arose. The group had no conventional means to defeat wraiths. So how did they escape? I decided to probe further, using An-sol as a lead-in.

“So, your sister got hurt because of them?”

An-hyeon slowly shook his head. What he said next left me dumbfounded. The wraiths had targeted him because of his fierce resistance, causing him intense pain. Eventually, unable to bear it, he dropped his sword and shield. In that critical moment, An-sol saved him.

I asked for more details, but An-hyeon couldn’t explain clearly. Yu-jeong and Han-byeol also shook their heads. All they could say was that An-sol screamed, her body suddenly glowed with white light, and the attacking wraiths vanished. Immediately after, she collapsed unconscious and hadn’t woken since.

After hearing their account, I nodded. An-hyeon stayed silent for a moment before speaking again, his face filled with worry.

“Hyung… Sol will be okay, right? She’ll wake up, won’t she?”

“How’s her condition?”

“She’s breathing steadily, and her pulse is normal. But sometimes she grimaces like she’s in pain and lets out soft groans.”

Magic Overdrive. Could An-sol have already manifested her magic? It seemed unbelievable, but I considered it possible. When I started, my low magic stat caused me a lot of trouble. Even after entering the Hall Plane, it took time to channel sword aura. But An-sol began with a magic stat of 75, so her case could be different. The subconscious is an uncharted realm, so there might be factors I didn’t know. One thing was certain: her untrained body likely couldn’t handle 75 points of magic. The severity might vary, but if she hadn’t overexerted herself too much, I could help her.

“I’d need to see her to be sure, but it doesn’t sound like a major issue. Don’t worry too much.”

“Then, could you take a look now…”

Just as I started to rise, thinking An-hyeon was being a bit much, a soft hand gently grabbed my wrist. Turning, I saw Yu-jeong pouting at me.

“Hey, An-hyeon, is that any way to talk to oppa when he just got back? Oppa, aren’t you hungry?”

“Huh? I can manage. Let’s check on An-sol first…”

“We’ve already been taking turns checking on her. Unless you’re a doctor, it can wait. You heard our story, so now tell us yours. I’ll whip up something quick, and we can talk while you eat. Sound good?”

What’s with her today? Her unusually proactive attitude felt a bit off, but I didn’t mind since she was looking out for me. An-hyeon seemed to relax slightly at her words, giving a sheepish smile and nodding.

“Here, have some water. I saved it earlier.”

“Oh? Thanks.”

Han-byeol pulled a water bottle from her pocket and handed it to me. I reached for it without thinking, but Yu-jeong suddenly smacked it away, sending it back to Han-byeol. Stunned by the sudden action, I heard Han-byeol’s sharp voice.

“What was that for?”

“You’re giving him the one you drank from? We’ll get oppa a fresh one. Drink that yourself.”

“What are you two…”

Before I could finish, Yu-jeong stood up briskly and headed to the kitchen. I heard her rummaging around, followed by clattering sounds as she prepared something. Turning back, I saw An-hyeon’s awkward expression and Han-byeol staring coldly at the floor. Caught off guard by the situation, I cleared my throat and quickly changed the subject.

“Have the others eaten?”

“…Yeah, hyung. We ate earlier. We were starving… haha.”

“No, you did the right thing. Waiting around aimlessly would’ve been foolish.”

An-hyeon scratched his head with an apologetic look. As I responded, a fresh water bottle was placed in front of me with a soft thud. Yu-jeong had already returned and set down a plate neatly. I almost doubted this was the same Yu-jeong I knew. The plate held crackers topped with canned tuna, arranged with visible care. She even opened the water bottle for me, speaking in a deliberately cheerful tone.

“Ta-da! Presenting Yu-jeong’s special crackers!”

“Oh, looks tasty. Let me try one… ugh!”

An-hyeon, swallowing hard, reached for a cracker, but Yu-jeong’s lightning-fast hand slapped his away. He rubbed his reddened hand with a disgruntled look, muttering under her glare.

“That’s stingy. Getting possessive over food?”

“I made it for oppa, not you. And who taught you to grab food before he’s even had a bite?”

“Tch.”

“Oppa, try it. I guarantee it’s good.”

“Uh, yeah. Thanks. I’ll eat well.”

I chuckled at An-hyeon’s grumbling and Yu-jeong’s dramatic huff as she turned away. Picking up a cracker and swallowing it, the cheap tuna and biscuit flavors spread in my mouth. It wasn’t gourmet, but it was decent enough, especially since I wasn’t picky right now. I chewed slowly, savoring it.

The atmosphere had lightened considerably from earlier. As I reached for another cracker, the intense stares made me feel I should say something. I couldn’t exactly admit to taking down over twenty Deadmen, so I planned to spin a slightly altered version. After praising Yu-jeong’s crackers, I began recounting how I lured the monsters in the forest.

“Hyung, so you almost got bitten back there?”

“I was zigzagging through the trees to shake them off. I didn’t expect one to leap out right beside me. If my left hand had been just a bit closer, I’d have been bitten for sure. Thinking about it still gives me chills.”

“Whoa… so we almost lost you for real.”

“Pfft. Hyung, you should’ve seen Yu-jeong before you got here. She was a mess—grabbing her sword, shouting we had to save you, saying you might still be waiting. She was ready to stab someone!”

“You wanna die? I wasn’t *that* dramatic.”

“See? You’re admitting you did it.”

“Ugh, shut up!”

Watching An-hyeon and Yu-jeong bicker and laugh, I felt a sense of relief. Just as I let out a quiet sigh in the softened mood, I caught sight of Han-byeol’s face, frozen in a cold expression. Her icy gaze, so different from before, sent a chill through me. I had thought it was no big deal, but the memory of her earlier shout stirred an instinct that I shouldn’t brush it off lightly. I decided to talk to An-hyeon privately as soon as this gathering ended.
