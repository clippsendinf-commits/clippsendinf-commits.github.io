# Memorize - Chapter 54: Our Oppa Has Changed

While I was sleeping soundly, I felt someone shaking my body. Groaning softly, I opened my eyes to see An-sol’s clear gaze looking down at me. The dim dawn landscape of the Black Forest came into view. The chill of the forest’s heart crept over my entire body. I circulated my mana briefly to awaken my senses, then raised my stiff body. My head felt refreshingly clear, putting me in a good mood.

“Everything okay?”

“Yes, nothing unusual. Did you sleep well, Orabeoni?”

When we’re with others, An-sol calls me “Oppa,” but for some reason, when it’s just the two of us, she insists on calling me “Orabeoni.” It’s a bit embarrassing, but not so cringeworthy that I’d make a fuss about it, so I let it slide. Seeing Sol bow politely with impeccable manners, I couldn’t help but think she must have been raised with excellent upbringing.

I responded to her greeting with a gentle smile and turned to wake An-hyeon and Yu-jeong, but I felt a tug on my sleeve. Turning back, I saw Sol hesitating, her lips moving as if she wanted to say something. With the softest voice I could muster, I spoke.

“Yes, Sol? Is there something you want to say?”

“Orabeoni… I…”

At my question, Sol avoided my gaze, staring at the ground. But then, biting her lip firmly, she lifted her head with a resolute expression. I had no idea what she was about to say, but I braced myself, waiting for her next words.

“…I need to pee…”

“…”

“It’s too scary to go alone… I want to go with you, Orabeoni.”

“Go ahead.”

I shook my head with a deflated expression. But this time, Sol didn’t back down. Despite my firm refusal, she clung to my sleeve, her lips tightly pressed together. Just as I was about to scold her for acting childish, I noticed her trembling eyes.

In the end, I decided to give in this once. But I couldn’t help feeling a bit skeptical about An-sol. She’d been in the Hall Plane for over three months, which meant she was a 20-year-old adult. Sure, she looked young for her age, but sometimes her behavior was so childish it was hard to believe. It wasn’t just me who found her actions odd. To an outsider, it might not be noticeable, but both Yu-jeong and I, having spent time with her, could tell something was off. Once, Yu-jeong had directly asked An-hyeon about it, but he dodged the question. It seemed like he was hiding something about Sol. I resolved to ask him again later and started walking with Sol away from the campsite.

“This should be far enough.”

“…”

“Sol?”

“Orabeoni… you won’t go anywhere and leave me, right?”

“I’ll stay right here. Don’t worry, go do your business.”

“You promise? Really, really promise?”

After making me swear multiple times, Sol finally let go of my sleeve with an anxious expression. As she slipped into the bushes, I pulled a cigarette from my pocket and lit it. As I took a drag, I heard the rustling of clothes being removed from the bushes, followed by the faint sound of Sol relieving herself. It felt awkward. Did she not feel embarrassed doing this with a man nearby? Or did she not even see me as a man? Neither possibility was particularly pleasant, so I puffed on my cigarette aggressively.

As the cigarette burned down, the sound of her urinating gradually faded. Then, I heard the soft crunch of grass as she walked back. Seeing me still standing there, Sol’s face visibly brightened, and I felt a small sense of relief.

“Thank you!”

“Ugh, you’re such a baby sometimes. You can’t keep acting like this.”

“Hehe, sorry!”

I lightly scolded her as she giggled, not sure what she found so amusing. As I turned to head back, Sol suddenly threw herself into my arms. Caught off guard, I dropped the cigarette I was holding. Why was she suddenly being so bold? She seemed to find my startled expression amusing, rubbing her face against my chest with a gentle smile.

“Orabeoni.”

“Y-Yes?”

“Honestly… yesterday, you scared me a little.”

“…Did I?”

So that was it. Stabbing that vagrant’s throat without hesitation must have seemed cruel to her. Still, she wasn’t trembling in my arms now, so I quietly waited for her to continue. After savoring the moment in my embrace, Sol spoke cautiously.

“But… Orabeoni is always strong and kind. If it weren’t for you, I…”

Unable to finish, she trailed off and closed her eyes. I sighed inwardly. Holding her now, I felt an odd sensation. The woman in my arms would later awaken as the Priest of Radiance, a renowned user. Her fame was so great that rumors spread of the Odin Clan, a group of the continent’s top users, personally recruiting her.

I had worked hard in my own way, but in terms of fame or raw ability, I couldn’t compare to her. Back then, An-sol was a user on an unreachable pedestal, yet here she was, clinging to me and relying on me. The surreal feeling washed over me.

Drawn in by that sensation, I instinctively wrapped my arms around her. Sol gasped in surprise but soon relaxed, her face warming. My left hand rested on her back, my right gently stroking her dark hair as I whispered softly.

“Should I have let that female vagrant live…? Did that scare you?”

Sol shook her head vigorously. Her movement tickled my chest, but it was the reaction I’d hoped for, so I gave a subtle smile. She seemed to enjoy my touch, her earlier anxiety gone, replaced by a soft, rustling smile as she spoke.

“No… I won’t be scared. Hyeon-oppa said we need to be like you to survive, Su-hyeon hyung. That we need to stay sharp. He said we’d all be dead if it weren’t for you… that we should stick close to you and do exactly as you say. So, I’m going to trust you, Orabeoni. Please… don’t abandon me.”

So that’s what An-hyeon said. Quite insightful of him. His words meant I’d firmly established myself in their hearts. If their reliance on me before was blind, entering the Black Forest had turned it into solid trust.

“I won’t abandon you. But Hyeon’s wrong about one thing. I don’t want you to just follow orders. I want us to think together and work hard together. This kind of clinginess…”

“I know, I know. But… just for a moment, I want to stay like this.”

I wanted to hold her a bit longer, but I wasn’t so weak as to lose control. I gently began to pull away, but Sol, undeterred, dove back into my arms, nodding energetically.

“I’ll work hard too! I’ll work so hard you’ll be proud, Orabeoni… so…”

“So?”

“Can we stay like this just a little longer?”

“…”

“And keep stroking my hair. Hurry!”

Taking my silence as agreement, Sol rubbed her face against me again, urging me on. I shrugged and obediently raised my hand. From today, it felt like Sol’s perception of me had distinctly changed.

“How’s your body feeling?”

“Light as a feather. I checked this morning, and my endurance stat went up by one! My recovery is insane—it doesn’t even feel like my body. I feel more flexible too.”

“Ha, as a melee fighter, keep an eye on your endurance. Otherwise, you’ll end up with a glass body.”

“Heh heh.”

An-hyeon was clearly pleased about his stat increase, chuckling happily. Yu-jeong, standing nearby, pouted, but she seemed in good spirits too. Seeing Hyeon like that, I felt a twinge of envy. I wanted to boost my stamina too…

If you sustain injuries far beyond your stat limits, your endurance can drop. But if the injuries are just slightly beyond or at the edge of your limits, and you recover fully, you can increase your endurance. It’s like a bone that, when broken cleanly, heals stronger. The body adapts to a certain level of damage.

Leaving An-hyeon, who was twirling his spear to show off his vigor, I packed up the campsite. After a quick breakfast, we set off again toward the Alchemist’s Dungeon.

I was certain the tracks we saw at the edge of the Black Forest didn’t belong to vagrants. I was following their trail now, and since the tracks hadn’t faded, it seemed they’d ventured deep into the forest. The latter half of the Black Forest was a place even seasoned users couldn’t take lightly. Yet, they’d pushed deeper, suggesting there was something significant. I suspected it was the dungeon of the ancient alchemist, Vivian.

“It feels like another horde’s gonna swarm us today. So creepy.”

An-hyeon, on guard duty, stepped forward to speak, likely recalling yesterday’s battle with the wolf pack. Noticing he didn’t let his guard down even while talking, I responded.

“That fight was definitely the most dangerous. Hordes like that are rare, though not unheard of. Anyway, when we finish this expedition, let’s get you some gauntlets.”

“Gauntlets? Oh, armor? I’m wearing the basic armor from the User Academy…”

“That’s just leather; it doesn’t offer much protection. As a spearman, chainmail or scale armor would be better than plate mail for mobility.”

“Oh, I don’t know much about armor, only weapons. Thinking back to yesterday’s fight, armor does sound useful. I could swing my spear more if I didn’t have to focus on dodging… but isn’t that stuff crazy expensive?”

I nodded at Hyeon’s words. High-quality armor from reputable sources is often unaffordable for novice users. Most struggle just to survive day-to-day. The fact that we’d acquired new weapons for this expedition was already a luxury by rookie standards.

“Yeah, unless we hit a jackpot, even veteran users aren’t guaranteed steady income. We’ll have to save up and gear up gradually.”

“If it comes to it, we’ve got the GP from the Rite of Passage.”

“No way. I told you before, that’s a last resort. Save your GP—it might come in handy later. For now, let’s work with what we’ve got.”

“Ugh, money’s always the problem, isn’t it?”

I chuckled at Hyeon’s grumbling, which sounded oddly mature for his age, and nodded. Among our group, An-hyeon was the most adapted to the Hall Plane. His comment about needing armor due to weak defenses and his long-term thinking were commendable.

After a brief chat with Hyeon, I activated my detection and Third Eye abilities. The tracks of the earlier group were growing stronger, meaning we’d likely catch up to them by tomorrow, or the day after at the latest. I had no intention of joining them. If we got lucky and found the dungeon first, I’d claim the rights. Established users would respect the first-discovery rule. But even if they found it first, I wasn’t worried.

*I heard they stumbled upon it but failed and all died. Well, “died” might not be the right word. Three of them? No, maybe just one. What do I mean? Well…*

The Alchemist’s Dungeon wasn’t supposed to be discovered yet. I remembered it being found a few months after I uncovered the Cave of Screams, two years from now. But if the caravan ahead found it now and my guess was correct, they’d likely be wiped out soon. They probably failed to conquer the dungeon and perished inside.

If they found it first, I’d step back. We could set up near the dungeon, wait a few days, and then enter to find their corpses. They might even clear some traps or monsters at the entrance, making our job easier. Plus, we could loot their gear for a decent profit.

With these calculations in mind, I quickened my pace. I wanted to clear the dungeon quickly and move on to the Ruined Laboratory and Cave of Screams. The others, unaware of my plans, simply followed my lead.
