# Memorize - Chapter 88: The Ruined Laboratory

After the fierce battle, I decided to take a short break. It might have seemed a bit early, but the kids were utterly exhausted from the fight. At my decision, Yu-jeong let out a delighted squeal and plopped down, only to scream and jump back up immediately.

“Ugh… this is awful.”

The area around us was littered with the corpses of the dead. Even if I was unfazed, Yu-jeong and Sol, who still had weak stomachs, were eager to move elsewhere. Meeting their expectations, I led us toward the room the dead had come from. It might feel a bit unsettling since it was where those creatures had been crawling about, but it was still better than a place filled with bodies.

I had expected something like a laboratory, but the room’s interior defied my expectations. The space was surprisingly cramped. It was hard to believe so many of those dead had come from such a small area.

I saw worn-out, broken beds and bookshelves. Nothing could be overlooked, no matter how trivial. While the others rested, I scoured the room, searching for anything that might provide information.

As the group sat quietly and I explored alone, Ha-yeon, letting out a soft sigh, joined me. Seeing Shin Sang-yong get up as well, the others hurriedly followed suit. But by then, I had already finished most of my search using the Third Eye.

“Leader, did you find anything?” Shin Sang-yong asked, his eyes gleaming with curiosity. His usual stuttering vanished when something intriguing came up.

I shook my head. “No, I checked thoroughly, but there’s nothing noteworthy.”

I showed them about 30 gold coins and a record written in ancient script.

“Only 30 gold? That’s harsh,” An-hyeon grumbled. Having just fought a tough battle, he seemed to be comparing this to the lucrative haul from our previous goblin fight in the clearing. Yu-jeong and Sol also looked disappointed, but Shin Sang-yong was different.

“Not bad. Thirty gold for one room. Haha. Oh, could you show me the record? I can decipher ancient script.”

“Of course.”

As expected, he’s useful. I handed over the record, and he adjusted his dusty glasses before diving into it. His ancient script deciphering ability was rank D-, but that was decent enough for a regular user.

After about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, I swallowed the jerky I’d been chewing and spoke as he returned the record. “Did you learn anything? Any important info?”

“Hmm, no, nothing like that. The record is written like a diary. It seems this room was used by one of the residents back then. Nothing significant, but… there’s a lot about spears. Things like not being able to practice with a spear today or disposing of failures with a spear. I couldn’t find any clear connection to the laboratory, though.”

“Spears?” I echoed.

Failures, huh. An-hyeon raised his spear, questioning, and Shin Sang-yong nodded. Hearing his response, a thought sparked in my mind, and my eyes lit up. It could just be about spears, but it might also be a clue related to the Ki-Gong Spearmaster. It wasn’t certain, but even a possibility made thoroughly exploring this dungeon worthwhile.

Starting with the record, Shin Sang-yong and I discussed the laboratory. The others listened while resting, and Ha-yeon seemed content to just hear him out. Though she surpassed him in combat, Shin Sang-yong clearly excelled in dungeon exploration.

“My guess is the laboratory has at least three floors, based on the exterior. We don’t know the full size of the first floor, but if we assume the hall we were in is the center, there are likely paths branching out in four directions—north, south, east, and west. Excluding the way we came in, there’s probably a staircase to the second floor in one of the other directions.”

“Right. Hmm. It might be better to clear the first floor completely before heading to the second.”

You never know where the Ki-Gong Spearmaster might be. Unaware of my thoughts, Shin Sang-yong nodded enthusiastically at my suggestion to play it safe.

“That’s a wise choice. Even clearing the first floor will take at least a day. This place is bigger than it seems. The second floor might have even nastier creatures. In the worst case, securing a safe zone before moving up is the better option.”

Shin Sang-yong often used the word “minimum” when speaking. People who use that term tend to unconsciously plan for the worst-case scenario, preparing countermeasures accordingly. It might seem overly cautious to others, but it’s a habit that definitely aids survival.

The kids looked glum at the idea that clearing the laboratory in one day would be tough. Sol, in particular, shivered at the thought of possibly sleeping here. Noticing her unease, Shin Sang-yong spoke cautiously.

“Alternatively, we could clear the first floor and return to the city to regroup before tackling the second floor. That’s the safest option, though it’ll take more time.”

I shook my head firmly. If it were just me and Vivian, I was confident we could conquer this place in half a day—no, six hours. Returning was out of the question. Shin Sang-yong didn’t seem to mind continuing either, showing no signs of complaint.

Clear each floor thoroughly, then move to the next. Even if it takes a few days, we’d conquer it all before returning to the city. As the group listened quietly, no one openly objected. I took a water bottle from Ha-yeon, finalizing our initial exploration goals for the laboratory.

Normally, I limit breaks to five or ten minutes, but this was a longer rest. The initial battle was so intense that I wanted everyone fully recovered before continuing. As we ate our supplies in silence, I noticed Ha-yeon, who had been sitting with her eyes closed, slowly opening them. Her gaze was fixed on me. I met her eyes, and we exchanged a silent look.

As I peered into her deep eyes, Ha-yeon’s lips parted slightly.

“Su-hyeon-ssi.”

“Yes?”

“I have a question.”

“Go ahead.”

“Are you really a zero-year user?”

“Yes.”

Her calm face rippled slightly at my brief responses, but she quickly composed herself, her elegant eyes narrowing. Normally, such an expression might annoy me, but with Ha-yeon, it felt refined and graceful.

“Sorry, but I need to say this. I don’t know how you’ll take it, but… it’s hard to believe, even seeing it with my own eyes. Those monsters we just fought weren’t something a zero-year user could handle alone.”

Her tone carried more astonishment than suspicion, but she seemed to be thinking about how I’d single-handedly held off the dead at the front. This time, though, I didn’t feel flustered or think about how to deflect. I planned to reveal my skills gradually anyway, and stumbling over my words here would only raise more suspicion.

“Really? I didn’t find it that difficult.”

“How did you fight them?”

“Simple. Their only advantage was numbers. They could’ve used coordinated formations or rotating attacks to capitalize on that, but they just rushed in recklessly. So, I countered, deflected, and used their attacks against them. I focused on defense.”

“Is that… as easy as it sounds? I don’t get it. Did you learn swordsmanship back in the modern world?”

I nodded honestly. “I did, but I don’t think that’s relevant. I just assess the situation, think of the best solution, and act on it.”

“You must be a genius.”

“I don’t know about that. I’ve never thought of myself as one. I just worked hard.”

“Hehe. The leader’s amazing, no doubt about it,” Shin Sang-yong interjected. “And Ha-yeon-ssi, let’s drop it. There’s nothing wrong with the leader being strong. You can check a zero-year user’s status at the User Academy, and we’re all here as witnesses, right?”

At his mediation, Ha-yeon flushed and lowered her head. “I’m sorry. I got carried away and sounded like I was interrogating you. I hope you’re not too upset. Your abilities are just so astonishing.”

“I was a bit annoyed at being called a genius. I’ll let it slide this time, but please don’t judge my hard-earned results by your own standards.”

Ha-yeon bowed her head, looking embarrassed, clearly understanding the sting in my words.

“Ahem.”

As expected, the kids didn’t catch the depth of our conversation. If Kim Han-byeol were here, she might’ve understood and shot back at Ha-yeon. Hearing my praise, though, Yu-jeong and the others straightened up proudly. Wait—why are they acting smug when I’m the one being praised?

Ignoring my thoughts, Yu-jeong puffed out her chest and spoke, her curves prominently displayed, making Shin Sang-yong turn away awkwardly. His occasional coughs confirmed my suspicion—he’s definitely a shy one.

“Hoho! Unni, you don’t know how amazing our oppa is! Did you go through the User Academy too?”

“Of course,” Ha-yeon replied.

“Our oppa was the top of his class—number one overall! You know how hard the instructors tried to recruit him? They even switched his dorm supervisor to a female user to sweet-talk him. It was hilarious.”

“Oh my, really? That impressive?” Ha-yeon’s eyes widened as Yu-jeong boasted excitedly. Being number one at the User Academy was indeed a notable title. Sol chimed in, backing her up.

“Yes, it’s true! Even the famous Golden Lion Clan made two offers to Oppa. Ahem.”

“The Golden Lion? Wow, they don’t usually offer new users.”

“Hehe, that’s because our oppa is the best!”

Okay, that’s enough. I’m getting embarrassed.

“Why did you turn down the Golden Lion Clan? I’m just curious, no other motive,” Shin Sang-yong asked, his voice full of admiration.

Before I could respond, An-hyeon answered for me. Seriously, give me a chance to speak!

“Because of us. We’ve been together since the Rite of Passage. They didn’t offer us, only Hyung. In a way, we held him back, and I feel bad about it.”

“No, you don’t need to feel bad. You did well,” Ha-yeon said suddenly, drawing everyone’s attention. She looked a bit flustered, as if she’d spoken reflexively.

An-hyeon tilted his head and continued. “Anyway, I think he didn’t want to leave us behind. Like Sol said, he rejected their offer right in front of us on graduation day.”

“I almost cried,” Yu-jeong added. “Thinking back, Oppa was different even during the Rite of Passage.”

“Yeah, if it weren’t for Su-hyeon Hyung, we might not have made it through. Whew.”

Ha-yeon looked at me with renewed curiosity. An-hyeon and Yu-jeong were practically gilding my reputation, but flattery gets old fast. As it dragged on, I started feeling increasingly awkward.

I cleared my throat and announced the end of the break. We’d rested enough, and the tense atmosphere had eased—it was time to resume exploring. Given the laboratory’s size, we needed to move quickly.

As we left the room, the group fell silent again. Stepping over the scattered corpses of the dead, we ventured deeper into the laboratory.
