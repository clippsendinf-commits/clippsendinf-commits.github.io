# Memorize - Chapter 126: A Small Rebellion

Her tank top was so tight that pulling it down just a bit seemed like it would make her chest spill out. Noticing my gaze, Go Yeon-ju rubbed her chest lightly with her hand, sending a provocative glance my way. Drawn in by her look, I reached out toward her chest. She flinched slightly at my touch but soon gave a coy smile, leaning her upper body forward slightly as if inviting me to do as I pleased.

And, meeting her expectations, I swiftly grabbed the handle of the dagger nestled between her cleavage and pulled it upward.

“…”

“It’s been bothering me for a while,” I said.

Go Yeon-ju’s face went blank for a moment before she burst into a giggle. Ignoring her laughter, I gently touched the blade. The dagger, still warm from the heat between her breasts, seemed to radiate a faint glow. Watching me, she spoke in a teasing tone.

“Why don’t you give it a sniff? I put on something nice today—it’s probably fragrant.”

“I’ll politely decline.”

“We’re alone here. Couldn’t you be a bit bolder?”

She was trying to steer the conversation in a strange direction again. I placed the dagger, which I’d been caressing, onto the table. The sharp edge felt like it wasn’t an ordinary dagger.

Now it was time to answer her question.

“The reason I told the Shadow Queen such important information…”

“Hmm…”

She let out a soft hum in response. I paused, glancing around. The table was littered with half-eaten food and empty liquor bottles. Picking up a bottle with some leftover alcohol, I filled two empty glasses and continued.

“I wanted your evaluation.”

“An evaluation… from me?”

I nodded at her question. Handing her a glass filled to the brim, I noticed she didn’t drink right away. Her pale gray eyes seemed to demand further explanation, as if that alone wasn’t enough. I decided to test her a little.

“I wanted to hear how someone who’s reached the <Ten Strongest> would evaluate my plans. Especially if that someone is the Shadow Queen.”

Her lips curved into a smile at my roundabout words.

“If we set aside the many uncertain factors, it’s a formidable plan. If those factors become reality… one Secret and two Rares. If that actually happens, the surrounding clans would be salivating, wouldn’t they? And to justify it with the Free Mercenary’s traits and mission operations… Well, it’s good. Honestly, I hadn’t even considered a Mercenary Clan in the Hall Plane until I heard your story. But…”

After her long speech, she downed her glass in one gulp. I waited for her next words. Savoring the taste of the liquor, she licked her lips slightly before speaking again with a deep smile.

“User Kim Su-hyeon, you’re not very good at lying, are you?”

I felt a sting inside but kept a calm face outwardly. When I didn’t respond, she let out a light laugh and continued.

“Oh, maybe ‘lying’ is a bit harsh. It’s more accurate to say that’s not the only reason.”

“Why do you think that?”

“When you’re being honest, you always look the other person straight in the eyes. But just now, you poured the liquor and handed it to me, using that as an excuse to avoid my gaze.”

I gave a wry smile at her speculation.

“That’s just a guess. What if I simply wanted a drink at that moment?”

“No, I’m certain of it. I can tell from your eyes.”

Her response came almost frighteningly fast. The usual softness in her expression vanished completely. A shadow fell over her face, and a heavy, sticky aura began to emanate from her. In an instant, her demeanor shifted, sending a thrill through my body. This was the Shadow Queen from the first cycle, a sight I hadn’t seen in a long time.

Go Yeon-ju stood up slowly, picking up the dagger I had taken. Step by step, she closed the distance between us.

Her gait was peculiar. At a glance, it might seem seductively swaying, but I knew it was her unique footwork, designed to close the distance with an opponent as quickly as possible in a straight line.

Instinctively, tension rose within me, and I began to sharpen my senses. Unfazed, Go Yeon-ju placed a hand on my chest and started circling me slowly.

When she had gone about halfway around and stood behind me, her quiet voice broke the silence.

“I came to the Hall Plane a long time ago. It’s been about five years now.”

“That’s what you said earlier…”

Before I could finish, she gently embraced me from behind. Her left hand slid across my chest, quickly searching my inner pocket. Soon, she pulled out two cigarettes and rested her chin on my shoulder, placing one in her mouth. I stayed calm, igniting a small flame at my fingertip to light her cigarette. She then offered the other one to me, placing it in my mouth.

“Hey, use this for the light.”

She grabbed my flaming finger and lowered it gently. Then, she brought her cigarette closer to mine. I exhaled deeply through my nose and tilted my head to align the tips of our cigarettes.

*Chik. Chiiiiik.*

A cigarette kiss. With a satisfied look, Go Yeon-ju exhaled a long plume of smoke. Savoring the cigarette’s aroma for a moment, she spoke in a low voice.

“Ever wonder why I act this way?”

“A little.”

Her soft chuckle came from beside me as I admitted it.

“I remember your first words, User Kim Su-hyeon. You said the clan you’re building aims for survival and return. That hit me hard.”

“Don’t you want to go back to Earth?”

“I want it desperately.”

I once described her as a flower laced with poison, one that could sting. Her reaction back then was unusual, and I thought I’d made a mistake. But now, it seemed she had her own story. Then again, who doesn’t have a story? Still, I felt a bit stifled.

“What kind of person do you think I was on Earth? Not User Go Yeon-ju, but Go Yeon-ju from South Korea.”

Her sudden question made me think. She was likely in her mid-to-late twenties, too old to be a college student. She didn’t seem like a career woman either, given how often she used her charm to entice men.

When I didn’t answer, she continued in a lonely tone.

“You know what I’m thinking, don’t you? Yeah, I was a bar girl.”

“…”

“Not that I was particularly dirty or depraved. But working in that world, sometimes you have to use your body, whether you like it or not. Clinging to men old enough to be my father, acting cute, deliberately spilling drinks on myself.”

“Everyone has their circumstances,” I said, struggling to respond.

Her hair brushed against my neck as she shook her head.

“Sorry, but I had no circumstances. No family troubles, no coercion. I went into that world willingly—for money and to satisfy my desires. So, how do you evaluate someone like me, User Kim Su-hyeon?”

I stayed silent. It felt like I should just listen. But she, too, stopped speaking, as if reluctant to continue. She didn’t want my response but wanted me to hear her—a contradictory emotion.

Instead of sugarcoating, I decided to speak honestly, sensing that’s what she wanted.

“Everyone has one or more jobs they do,” I began calmly. “And… being a bar girl doesn’t exactly have a great image.”

“…Heh.”

She let out a soft laugh and released her embrace. Her body slipped away from mine, and she began circling me again.

“Know what the best thing about coming to the Hall Plane is?”

“There’s nothing good about the Hall Plane,” I replied immediately.

She wagged her finger at me.

“No, there is for me. That user, Ha-yeon, earlier… she had such a clear, pure face. Probably lived diligently in the modern world, maybe in college or something. Unlike me. Honestly, I got upset earlier partly because of her attitude, but mostly because of her eyes—her gaze.”

She had called my words a lie, citing my eyes as evidence. I felt the need to listen more closely.

“When she looked at me with those clear eyes, all judgmental, it really got to me. I hate those kinds of looks. So I deliberately tore my clothes to expose myself.”

“What kind of look was it?”

“Like I was something cheap.”

Cheap. At that moment, I glimpsed the heart hidden within her. She was comparing her life in the Hall Plane to her life on Earth—a sense of inferiority, perhaps. And now I understood why I was slightly drawn to her in the first cycle. For some reason, she felt disappointed in people and couldn’t fully trust them. If I was right, we had something in common.

“The Hall Plane is fascinating. Someone who was an elite in the modern world can become a beggar here. Conversely, someone who was a nobody on Earth can become a celebrity in the Hall Plane.”

She circled halfway again and stopped. Standing in front of me, her body was turned so I could only see her profile.

“And a woman who worked in a bar, looked down on by others in the modern world… in the Hall Plane, she can become the Shadow Queen, revered by users.”

Finishing her words, she turned halfway to face me directly. Step by step, she closed the distance again, pressing her body against mine. I remained still, sharpening my senses, but found no threat in her demeanor.

She placed both hands on the back of my head, resting her head diagonally against my chest. From a distance, we might look like lovers embracing, but what I felt was far from that. With her face buried in my chest, she continued.

“I always look at people’s eyes. They tell me what someone thinks of me, at least roughly.”

Her Unique Ability, <Eyes of Seduction>. I had thought it was simply a power gained as the Shadow Queen. Acquired Unique Abilities are incredibly rare, after all. But her words made me think it might be something else.

“Lately, things have been too noisy, and I wanted a break. I also wanted to avoid troublesome matters. So I came down to Mul and opened an inn. Who would’ve thought the famous Shadow Queen would be running an inn here?”

“…”

“I hid my identity, recalling the past. I wore provocative clothes on purpose, swayed my hips as I walked, and openly flirted. As expected, male users’ eyes gleamed with desire, while female users gave me disdainful looks. It was bittersweet but also kind of fun. On Earth, I was always on the receiving end, but here, I could turn the tables. But…”

She paused, tightening her grip on my head, pulling it down while tilting her own head upward. Our eyes met—hers looking up, mine looking down. We were very close. Her shadowed face was right in front of mine—her sharp eyes, delicate nose, and pretty lips. As she exhaled softly, the sweet scent of liquor and the fragrant aroma of the cigarette mingled.

Her eyes meticulously scanned mine before she spoke softly, dropping the formal tone.

“You were different.”

“How so?”

“Nothing. Your eyes are empty. No matter how much I tempted or teased, I only saw two emotions in your eyes.”

Had I ever shown emotion in my eyes? Curiosity piqued, I let a smile tug at my lips. Go Yeon-ju was truly an intriguing user.

“One was that you found me annoying.”

She had been a bit bothersome at times. I nodded once or twice and immediately asked about the other.

“And the other?”

A brief silence followed. Her lips were tightly shut, but she didn’t avoid my gaze. We stared into each other’s eyes for a while.

Finally, her lips parted slowly.
