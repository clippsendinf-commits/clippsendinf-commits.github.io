# Chapter 89: The Ruined Laboratory

Instead of heading straight to the second floor, we decided to thoroughly clear the first floor before ascending. While speeding up the攻略 process would be ideal, I changed my mind after Shin Sang-yong read the ancient records. If we could find a Ki-Gong Spearmaster, investing not just two or three days but two or three months would be far from a waste.

To be honest, I was a bit skeptical. We had just recently found a Chimera Alchemist, so would another rare find appear so soon? Was I being too greedy? Secret and Rare Classes don’t just pop up as I wish, do they?

Yet, I couldn’t shake a strange sense of anticipation. Right now, I was riding a wave of momentum. Life works like that sometimes. In my first cycle, when things went downhill, they plummeted to rock bottom—literally to the deepest pits of Hell. But just as you can fall endlessly, you can also rise to the very top when the tide turns. I felt that upward surge now, and though I didn’t know how long it would last, I wanted to ride this flow and lean into it as much as possible.

Standing in the center of the hall, I activated my Third Eye again. It’s been incredibly useful.

“Leader, which direction should we head first?” someone asked, prompting me to decide our path.

I combined my detection skills with the Third Eye to scan the surroundings. As Shin Sang-yong had noted, the hall served as the central hub of the first floor’s structure. Excluding the corridor we entered from, there were three possible directions to proceed. Given that this was a laboratory, there were countless obstacles, but only a few rooms or spaces seemed worth entering: six rooms and one staircase to the west, four rooms to the north, and one room with another staircase to the east. The staircases likely led to the second floor.

“Let’s head this way first,” I said, turning toward the western corridor.

Better to get the toughest part over with first. The west had the most locations to explore, so it made sense to start there. If we were exhausted, I might have chosen the east with its single room, but our stamina was fully restored after resting.

Naturally, I took the lead. Typically, the caravan leader or a ranger would take point, but with no ranger in our group, I filled the role alone. I silently hoped our next recruit would be an archer as I guided the party forward.

The leader’s role is critical. You must be prepared for sudden ambushes and make decisions that can either make or break the caravan. Without a ranger, Shin Sang-yong or Jeong Ha-yeon would normally take point, but putting mages up front wasn’t an option. My proven leadership, far surpassing that of any ranger, had earned the group’s trust, and they followed without complaint.

I walked down the corridor without hesitation, maintaining a steady pace. At first glance, the laboratory’s layout seemed complex, but it was fairly straightforward if you distinguished between rooms worth entering and those to skip. Apart from the single figure we encountered in the initial corridor, I sensed no other presence in the hallways. This meant we only needed to be cautious of the rooms or spaces themselves.

Of course, there was no guarantee the second or third floors would follow the same pattern, so this assumption was limited to the first floor.

Soon, we reached the first space. It was the outermost area along the western corridor, according to my detection. The rooms we’d passed on the way south resembled hospital wards, but this space felt entirely different. The heavy iron door and walls bore faint, dark red bloodstains. And from within… I sensed something alive, breathing. What could it be? How was it still alive after all this time?

I stopped in front of the door and turned to the party.

“Before we reached the central hall, when we opened a door, monsters poured out, and everyone panicked,” I said, pausing to glance at Yu-jeong. She was the culprit who’d flung the door open, exclaiming, “What’s this?” She lowered her head sheepishly. I clicked my tongue inwardly and continued.

“There aren’t many presences inside this room, but we shouldn’t retreat recklessly like last time. It’s better to fight with the door as a chokepoint. The creature inside seems aware of us, so don’t let your guard down when we open it.”

Tension spread across the party’s faces. After watching them prepare, I stepped toward the door.

“I’ll open it. An attack might come immediately. Sol, cast a binding spell right away. You two mages, restrict its movements with your spells. An-hyeon and Yu-jeong, move slightly forward in the formation. And don’t neglect the flanks, just in case.”

No one responded aloud, but they nodded silently, following my orders. I added one final note.

“No matter what’s inside, fighting at the door gives us the advantage. Here we go…”

I reached for the handle. Behind me, I heard Yu-jeong whisper, “I hope it’s just an empty room,” and An-hyeon reply, “Hyung said something’s in there.” I ignored them. My hand gripped the handle, and I pulled with a grunt. The door was heavy, too much for an ordinary person, but my strength stat made it manageable.

*Creak.*

The long-sealed door groaned as its rusted mechanisms were forced open. With a bit more effort, I yanked it fully open. A shattering sound accompanied a foul stench that assaulted my senses. And then—

“ROOAAAR!”

A massive fist swung toward me. But we weren’t caught off guard.

“Shackle!” Sol’s spell rang out, and a white light shot past me.

I mentally cheered at her perfect timing, but the next moment was far from ideal.

“Grr… AAARGH!”

The arm, momentarily halted, twitched and broke free, ignoring Sol’s binding spell. It swung at me again. A spell with a magic stat over 80, resisted? Shocked but focused, I raised my scabbard to block the attack.

“Su-hyeon, watch out!” someone shouted.

*Thud! Crash! Boom!*

“Kelrek! Kelrek! Kelrek!”

The force was impressive. I hadn’t used my full strength, but the impact pushed me back half a step. Drawing on a technique I’d used against a boss monster during the Rite of Passage, I applied the principle of *Four Ounces Moving a Thousand Pounds*. Combining the creature’s momentum with my own strength, I redirected the force back at it.

The creature’s right hand exploded from the impact and was flung backward, crashing loudly as it fell in agony.

“…A giant,” I muttered.

“A g-giant. It’s my first time seeing one in person,” someone stammered.

The creature clutching its hand was indeed a giant. Its towering height, over five meters, was a spectacle, but it wasn’t a pristine giant. Mechanical devices and artifacts were grafted onto its body—or perhaps “implanted” was the better term.

Now I understood why Sol’s spell hadn’t worked. Giants in the Hall Plane have blood that naturally resists magic. Normally, it would have reflected the spell entirely, but this giant was visibly weakened, so it only resisted. The attached devices and artifacts likely extended its lifespan but had eroded its innate traits over time.

“Grr… Grr… Hff, hff.”

“Everyone, focus. It’s a giant, but it’s heavily weakened. Its magic resistance is still intact, though, so Sol and the mages, step back for now.”

“Even if direct help is tough, I can assist indirectly,” one of the mages offered.

“I won’t stop you. Yu-jeong, take the keeper role. An-hyeon, Vivian, behind me.”

“Support, Hyung?” An-hyeon asked.

“Yeah.”

An-hyeon rushed forward, thrilled to be chosen. Vivian, understanding why I called her despite being an alchemist, moved to my side. As we swiftly reformed our formation, I turned back to the giant. It was struggling to stand, using its remaining arm to push itself up.

Our eyes met. This giant was likely another victim of the residents’ experiments. Its gaze burned with unmistakable hostility, but that was all. I hadn’t conducted the experiments, so I felt no guilt or pity.

Giants are naturally powerful, with formidable racial traits. In my first cycle, their leader was nearly a demigod. Despite their honest and simple nature, they make reliable allies. But I had no intention of befriending this one.

I heard Vivian muttering a spell behind me. The giant’s expression grew more menacing, sensing her magic.

*Whoosh.* Its remaining left arm swung at me. The blow lacked the raw power I’d expect from a giant, but it still carried significant force. I tilted my head back to dodge, unwilling to let the opportunity slip. Raising my sword with my left hand, I lightly grazed its fist with the blade’s flat side. As intended, the moment they connected, I unleashed my mana.

The result was spectacular enough to draw gasps from the party. In my first cycle, to compensate for my inferior strength and mana compared to top-tier users, I developed a sword technique based on the concept of *Taiji*—emphasizing softness and flow over brute force. Though the giant’s fist only touched my blade, its arm was pulled along as I guided it. I tugged left, then right, like a cat toying with a string. The massive creature, over five meters tall, was reduced to a flailing puppet.

An-hyeon didn’t miss the opening.

“Hah!”

With a spirited shout, he thrust his long spear at the giant’s torso, aiming to land a hit while it was off-balance. But even a weakened giant retained its instincts. Despite its swaying, it accurately tracked the spear’s tip and swatted the shaft with its free right arm.

“Urk…!”

The force tilted An-hyeon downward. The clash was loud, fueled by mana, but his attack was too direct. Aiming for a blind spot would have been wiser.

At that moment, the giant roared, and I felt the mana connecting my sword to its hand snap. I raised an eyebrow, impressed but unbothered—I’d only been playing lightly. More importantly, An-hyeon and I had bought enough time for Vivian to complete her spell.

As if on cue, her clear voice echoed through the room.

“Come forth, Imprison! The steel binder who rules the 49th Legion!”

A familiar magic circle appeared, and pale smoke filled the room. The circle glowed brightly, signaling the spell’s activation. Sensing danger, the giant instinctively backed away to create distance.

As I watched, Vivian’s calm voice called out from behind.

“Su-hyeon, I’ll have Imprison focus on support. You and An-hyeon land the critical hits.”

“You’re binding it? A giant’s blood won’t make that easy.”

“Hmph. My chimeras are personally enhanced. Just watch—I’ll show you whose power is greater.”

“I’m looking forward to it.”

Vivian and I exchanged words casually. Her confidence was palpable, a smirk playing on her lips. Imprison—what would it show us this time? Seeing An-hyeon grip his spear tightly, still frustrated from his failed attack, I readied my stance.
