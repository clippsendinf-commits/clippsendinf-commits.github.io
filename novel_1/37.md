# Memorize - Chapter 36 (36/1068): To the Hall Plane!

The teleportation was nothing special. Having experienced it hundreds of times before, it felt routine. After arriving at the Inn of Beginnings, I stepped out into the second-floor hallway and noticed a commotion coming from downstairs. For now, it was time to wait for the existing Users who had already entered the Hall Plane to guide the newcomers. Usually, everyone stayed quiet, tense with anticipation, so this noise was unexpected.

Once the new Users completed their setup and the teleportation process ended, the barrier surrounding the inn would lift. As soon as it did, veteran Users would enter to guide the newcomers. Back in the day, I used to resent those assigned to guide us. Their attitudes were often arrogant, like corporals fresh from basic training looking down on new recruits. Of course, they were survivors of the Rite of Passage themselves and had once been in our shoes. I acknowledged their effort in surviving.

Listening to them talk was quite a spectacle. As they adapted to the Hall Plane, they’d see new Users and think, “I was like that once,” puffing up with pride. For the record, the User who told me that died three months later.

Regardless, I didn’t like it, but there was no other choice for now. Listening to their explanations and quietly enrolling in the User Academy was the best course of action. Speaking of which, the User Academy was a brilliant idea. I don’t know who proposed it, but they must have been sharp. Unlike the chaotic, haphazard methods of the past, the academy significantly reduced the number of new Users dying senselessly in the early stages.

Anyway, after reuniting with the others, I was thinking about what to say. Lost in various thoughts, I walked down the second-floor hallway until I reached its end. Just as I thought about opening the door in front of me, a voice stopped me.

“Damn it!”

Even if it was a lie, I wanted to clear up any misunderstandings with the group after meeting them. But I froze, my hand pausing on the door. From the first-floor staircase, familiar voices echoed through the gap, one after another.

“Don’t bark like that, you bastard!”

“You idiot, I told you, I saw it with my own two eyes!”

“Your eyes are the problem! Watch your mouth!”

“Crazy girl! Was I the only one who saw it? Bo-rim saw it too! The crossbow was snapped in half!”

Hearing the name “Bo-rim,” I could guess who was behind the coarse shouting. The troublemaker, Park Dong-geol. I hadn’t expected him to make it to the Hall Plane alive. Honestly, after parting ways, I hadn’t cared whether they lived or died. Still, I decided to think positively. I remembered how they’d annoyed me early on, so maybe I’d get a chance to deal with them later.

The high-pitched voice was unmistakable—it was Yu-jeong, always clashing with Dong-geol. They must have some serious bad blood. Clicking my tongue, I quietly opened the door.

“Shu—!?”

The creaking door swung open, revealing a crowd of people. Yu-jeong, about to yell “Shut up,” stopped mid-sentence as she heard the door and looked up. I gave her an awkward smile.

As expected, I was the last to teleport among the Users. The moment I stepped forward, countless eyes turned toward me. A quick count showed over forty people packed into the inn—survivors. Back in my time, we barely had twenty. Excluding the high level of Users, defeating the boss monster on the sixth day must have made a difference. Normally, more than half of these people would have died by the final day.

Descending the stairs step by step, I offered a light greeting.

“Looks like everyone made it. Glad you’re all safe.”

Of course they made it. I’d sent them through the warp gate like precious cargo. Despite my casual greeting, there was no response. Just as I started to feel awkward, Yu-jeong stumbled toward me.

“Oppa…?”

“Yeah.”

She raised her arms, touching my face and gently brushing my cheeks. Her eyes and lips trembled, as if overwhelmed with shock and emotion. It wasn’t just her. The faint hope they’d clung to had become reality before their eyes. An-hyeon’s group, along with Woo Jeong-min, who seemed to have pieced things together, stared at me in disbelief.

Yu-jeong spoke in a choked voice.

“Oppa… Is it really you, Su-hyeon oppa? Not someone else?”

“What, do I look like a doppelgänger? Ow, don’t pull so hard. That hurts.”

“Congratulations on surviving. I didn’t think you’d make it… That’s impressive.”

As I pried Yu-jeong’s hands off my cheeks, a husky voice came from the side. Turning, I saw Woo Jeong-min and his group, as expected, among the survivors. He looked like he wanted to say more, but I shook my head slightly. He seemed to catch my signal and closed his mouth. I briefly locked eyes with Won Hye-su, who turned away sharply in response.

An-hyeon’s face was filled with joy, Yu-jeong’s a mix of happiness and sadness, and Sol-i looked like she was about to cry. For a moment, An-hyeon’s group and I just stared at each other. They kept moving their lips, wanting to say something, but no words came out.

When words fail to come, it doesn’t matter much. But I wanted to escape the weight of all these stares. It was already overwhelming, and if Sol-i started bawling in front of this crowd, I’d be mortified.

Trying to soothe Sol-i, who looked ready to burst into tears, I deliberately moved to a corner. Meanwhile, Park Dong-geol, completely ignored, glanced at us sitting at a table before storming off with Lee Bo-rim to the opposite side.

After some time, the attention on us lessened, and the group seemed to have calmed down. The only issue was Sol-i, who had glued herself to my side, clutching my sleeve tightly.

I shot a pleading look at An-hyeon, who gave an awkward smile before speaking.

“Hyung, I still can’t believe it. You’re like an immortal.”

“Haha, immortal’s a bit much. I just got lucky.”

An-hyeon shook his head at my words. But seriously, do something about her. She’s not a toddler—why is she clinging to my sleeve? Sol-i, oblivious to my thoughts, spoke in a trembling voice.

“No, it’s like witnessing a miracle. While waiting at the bottom of the stairs, I kept hoping… Every time, oppa…”

Her grip on my sleeve tightened as she spoke, trailing off into sobs. I felt awkward but also knew I’d have to lie soon, so I gave a wry smile inwardly.

“Anyway, I’m glad we’re all here, alive.”

“If you’re alive, you should’ve come sooner! Always making us worry… No, sorry, oppa. I know you didn’t mean to…”

Yu-jeong’s scolding turned into an apology, then tears. I tilted my head, surprised at how much they cared but also feeling a bit proud. She clenched her fist, wiping away tears, and continued.

“Oppa, tell us. That jerk said your crossbow was found snapped in half near the warp gate. You were gone, and so was the monster.”

Here it comes. Burning the boss monster’s body beforehand was a stroke of luck, but failing to dispose of the crossbow was my mistake. I wanted to brush it off, but a cold gaze stopped me. It was Kim Han-byeol. If I glossed over this, I sensed trouble brewing with her later.

Since arriving at the inn, Han-byeol hadn’t said a word. Her expression barely changed, except for a fleeting moment when she first saw me. I met her gaze briefly, and a slight pang of unease hit me as I read her emotions.

Overall, there was relief, but I caught a faint trace of distrust and suspicion in her eyes. Han-byeol wasn’t ordinary. In some ways, she was like me—never fully swayed by emotions or circumstances, always leaving room for reason. I might never fully grasp her true nature, but one thing was clear: she was starting to doubt me.

The inn wasn’t as noisy as before, nor was it silent. Survivors’ hushed conversations filled the air. I sighed inwardly, feeling like I’d been sighing a lot lately. Rather than making up a clumsy story, I decided to claim I couldn’t remember much.

“Yeah, that’s true. I tried to dodge the monster’s attack, but it might’ve targeted the crossbow. It snapped in half instantly. It was pretty grim.”

“Is your left arm okay?”

Han-byeol spoke up immediately. It sounded like concern, but to me, it was, “Weren’t you wearing the crossbow on your left arm?” Smacking my lips, I answered quickly.

“It attacked with its tail. I instinctively raised my arm, but it just grazed the crossbow.”

“And then what happened?”

“Well, honestly, I don’t remember much. It’s like my mind went blank. I thought I was done for. The monster was stomping like crazy, and I was rolling on the ground like a madman…”

I spoke quietly, heavily editing my actual experience and talking in circles. The gist was that I used the dust cloud to escape, rolling toward the forest’s lowlands with all my strength. Everyone nodded—except Han-byeol. Anyone who’d faced a boss monster head-on for over three minutes would know my story was full of holes.

Han-byeol seemed lost in thought and didn’t press further. Maybe because she hadn’t been there, or because the mood was focused on celebrating my survival, she stayed quiet. But her suspicious gaze lingered. I decided to hold back for now. Talking in circles was meant to buy time, after all.

By now, the barrier outside the window had significantly faded.
