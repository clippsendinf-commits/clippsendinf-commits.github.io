# Memorize - Chapter 75: A Bumper Crop of Mages

The moment I reached out to Vivian with greedy eyes, a memory flashed through my mind. That fleeting recollection struck my head with force, resonating deeply. Startled by the impact, I managed to pull back the rationality that had been overtaken by desire.

This wasn’t right. A feeling surged in my chest, telling me this was wrong.

Suppressing the lust that consumed me, I pushed Vivian away. Even though desire coursed through me, giving in to my instincts anywhere and everywhere would make me no better than a beast. I had deliberately lured her to a secluded place with ulterior motives, but that action itself was a mistake from the start. Taking a deep breath, I steadied myself and regained control.

I’m not a eunuch, nor am I a man uninterested in women. I’m a healthy young man with a natural interest in the opposite sex. But that’s separate from what I was about to do with Vivian. Acting on every whim, vowing to conquer a woman today—that’s not who I am. I’ve never thought of myself as that kind of person, nor have I lived that way.

One deep breath.

Lately, I’d been riding high, things going my way, and I’d started to take my surroundings lightly. While I’d regained some of my lost humanity, the sharp edge I once had was dulling in return.

Of course, there’s nothing wrong with being with a woman. Even now, I’m confident I could be with Vivian if I chose to. But as I said, letting desire control me is something I refuse. Desire shines brightest when tamed and restrained within my grasp, not when it’s unleashed recklessly—the kind of behavior I despise most. Thinking I *had* to be with a woman today? That thought alone was embarrassing. If I’d come back just to chase women, I’d be too ashamed to face Seraph again.

“Su-hyeon? What’s wrong? Are you okay?”

“…”

As I calmed myself and opened my eyes, Vivian spoke to me hesitantly. When I only stared in silence, she seemed unable to bear the quiet and continued in a cautious voice.

“No, it’s just… maybe it’s my imagination, but you seemed like a different person for a moment…”

“Did I?”

“Yeah. Don’t make that face again. It gave me chills…”

Vivian hugged her arms tightly. I quickly softened my expression and gave a faint smile. Seemingly reassured, she smiled brightly and stepped closer, linking her arm with mine. I gently pulled my arm free and started walking toward the inn. From behind, I heard Vivian’s whiny “Hiiing,” but I ignored it.

“Su-hyeon. Su-hyeon.”

“What?”

Despite my response, Vivian skipped ahead, turned around, and faced me. When I replied in a curt tone, she pouted visibly.

“So, I’ll be traveling with you guys from now on, right?”

“That’s what we agreed on.”

“Got it. Then… I have a little worry…”

“Ack!”

While walking backward to show off, Vivian tripped over her own feet and fell flat on her back. Her robe flew open, exposing her body completely. Rubbing the back of her head after hitting it, she noticed my gaze and hurriedly covered herself. Her face turned sullen.

“Pervert.”

“Why am I a pervert?”

“You’re lying. You saw everything.”

“I did see, but I didn’t lie. And it’s not like I flipped your robe on purpose. You tripped and fell, and it opened on its own. Why are you blaming me? Don’t accuse an innocent person of being a creep.”

Her eyes widened at my calm, logical tone, then she nodded awkwardly, looking flustered.

“Uh, yeah? You’re right. Sorry. But you didn’t have to be so serious about it. Now I feel embarrassed.”

Seeing her readily admit her mistake, I responded, “Just be more careful next time. You’re too careless sometimes,” and offered my hand. As she took it and stood up, I added, “Anyway, what’s your worry?”

“Well… we’re going to be traveling together, right?”

“I just said that. Get to the point.”

“…That Yu-jeong and An-sol, was it? I think they don’t like me.”

“Yeah, they probably don’t.”

I nodded immediately, and Vivian let out a sigh. But it was true—the kids didn’t like her. In situations like this, it’s better to be upfront about the reality and encourage her to improve her attitude rather than brushing it off.

“But they’re good kids at heart. Since we’ll be traveling together, if you’re patient and show your good side, you’ll get along fine.”

“Really?”

“Of course. I’ll talk to them separately, too. Don’t worry too much.”

“Thanks… But I have one more worry…”

I nodded for her to continue, and after hesitating, she spoke in a voice as soft as a mosquito’s buzz.

“My clothes…”

It seemed Jeong Ji-yeon’s robe was indeed too small for her. Seeing Vivian blush and fidget, I headed straight for the shop without delay.

*

After stopping by a clothing store to buy a mage’s robe, we headed straight to the inn we’d stayed at before, *The Modest Lady*. I figured there’d be a lot to do once we returned to Mul, but for now, I just wanted to rest. Most of the tasks were related to the kids, and rushing into things right after arriving wouldn’t do any good. It’s more efficient to rest properly when it’s time to rest and focus when it’s time to work.

As I pushed open the creaky wooden door and stepped inside, I saw that the inn was somewhat lively with users. Given the time of day, people were ordering snacks and beer, chatting noisily. Go Yeon-ju, bustling about, turned toward the sound of the door and spotted Vivian and me.

“Hello, User Kim Su-hyeon. You’re a bit later than the others.”

She greeted me with a gentle smile and an elegant bow. I returned a brief nod and asked if the kids had gone upstairs. Instead of answering, she pointed to a corner. There, the kids sat with glum faces, picking at a pile of food on the table with their chopsticks.

I let out a soft groan, and Go Yeon-ju chuckled, looking at the kids with an approving gaze.

“They must have been waiting for you, Su-hyeon. They’re rare kids these days.”

“Hmm. Thanks anyway.”

“Thanks? It’s all business. By the way, I see a new face…”

Her sharp eyes turned to Vivian, who stood awkwardly behind me. I pulled her forward and introduced her.

“She’s a new member of our party.”

“She looks like a mage. You’ve got quite the knack.”

“It’s nothing. You seem busy, though.”

“Oh, my head! I got distracted. See you later, then.”

Go Yeon-ju seemed eager to chat more, but since Vivian was still a resident and I wasn’t ready to fully introduce her, I politely deflected. She understood and stepped back, but her “See you later” hinted at a future meeting. Since she was also on my recruitment list, I wouldn’t mind talking one-on-one in a quieter setting.

The kids noticed me and brightened up, waving enthusiastically. I hurried to their table, sat down, and spoke.

“I told you to eat and rest. You didn’t have to wait.”

“Still, it didn’t feel right to relax while you and Vivian were out there,” An-hyeon said, scratching his head with a shy smile.

If I’d given in to temptation with Vivian back there, these kids would’ve been starving while waiting for me. Feeling a pang of guilt, I urged them to eat and picked up my spoon. Vivian, unfamiliar with chopsticks, grabbed a fork and stared at the lavish spread, pondering her choice.

“You ordered a lot.”

“I was so hungry. Hehe, sorry, oppa. I might’ve gone overboard,” Yu-jeong admitted with a playful grin, owning up to ordering too much. I liked her honesty and gave her a lenient smile.

“Well, we’ve got enough money. It’s not great to waste, but this much is fine.”

“Mm-hmm. Did your errand go well?”

“Oh, right… hyung, the temple…” An-hyeon mumbled through a mouthful of food, clearly starving.

An-hyeon was wolfing down his meal, An-sol was quietly focused on her food, and Vivian, touched by the taste of human food after so long, chewed with a blissful expression. I tore off a piece of bread, dipped it in spiced soup, and popped it into my mouth, savoring the warm, savory flavor.

“I stopped by the temple and the shop. Vivian needed new clothes.”

“Her old ones were pretty embarrassing, even to me. Nice choice. But you went to the temple for the expedition report, right?”

“Among other things. They’re too busy to take reports right now, so I got Vivian’s body healed and signed a contract. Nothing major.”

“Contract?”

The kids perked up at the mention of a contract, chewing their food and turning their curious gazes toward me. I briefly explained the situation and showed them the contract. Noticing Vivian watching me cautiously, I felt the need to add a bit more.

“As you can see, Vivian’s now a resident who won’t oppose us and will support us fully. I’d love to introduce her properly, but there are too many eyes and ears here…”

I paused and glanced around. Sure enough, I caught several users stealing glances at us—mostly at An-sol, Yu-jeong, and Vivian. It wasn’t hard to guess what they were thinking. After reducing the attention with a quick scan, I continued.

“So, she’ll be traveling with us from now on. She’s a skilled mage, so keep that in mind. We’ll do a proper introduction tomorrow, straight from her. I know how you feel, but try not to judge her too harshly. She’s trying to start fresh as a human, so… you get what I mean, right?”

An-hyeon nodded absently, likely expecting this since we left the dungeon together. An-sol pouted but nodded reluctantly at my earnest words, though her expression showed she’d need time to fully accept Vivian. Deciding time would resolve things, I turned to Yu-jeong. Her face bore a twisted smile.

“Hohoho. ‘Never oppose’ and ‘support fully,’ huh? Hohoho.”

Her dangerous smile lingered as she scrutinized the contract. Handing it back, she locked eyes with Vivian, who smiled awkwardly. Yu-jeong responded with a dazzling smile of her own. Watching quietly, An-hyeon spoke to me in a low voice.

“Hyung, don’t worry too much. I’ll keep an eye on things.”

“…Thanks. I appreciate it.”

“And… don’t you have something to ask us?”

Still eating, An-hyeon speared a large piece of meat. Catching his hint, I met his expectation.

“Right, I was just about to ask. What about the users we brought back?”

“They haven’t woken up yet. They’re breathing, so they’re alive. The man’s in our room, and the woman’s in Sol and Yu-jeong’s. We got slightly bigger rooms this time.”

“Good job.”

“What’s the plan?”

I paused to think. Their stats and dispositions were promising, but I’d need to talk to them once they woke up. The issue was Vivian. It wasn’t just me—everyone knew she was the dungeon’s spider master. Even if we made an offer, would they join us? I tapped the table habitually and spoke, feeling like every solved problem birthed another.

“Let’s wait until tomorrow. If it doesn’t work out, we’ll visit the temple again. We can’t keep taking care of them forever.”

“Got it, hyung.”

Satisfied, An-hyeon buried his face in his plate again. The food was high quality and delicious. I could eat more, but I wasn’t a big eater, so I set my spoon down. Seeing this, An-sol, who’d been watching, placed a large piece of meat on my plate.

“Oppa, you’re not well. Eat more.”

Her sparkling eyes met my bittersweet smile, and I picked up my spoon again. The tense atmosphere was starting to ease as we settled back into city life. I glanced out the inn’s window.

The sun had fully set, and dusk had settled over the ground. For now, I just wanted to sleep without a single thought.
