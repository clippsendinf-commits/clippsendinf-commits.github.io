# Memorize - Episode 30 (30/1068): Why Are You Acting Like That?

“After we found the cabin, Oppa said he was going to scout the surroundings and stepped out. That’s when we started talking about you among ourselves.”

“What did you talk about?”

“We talked about the other survivors we met today. There was that guy who threw a dagger at Yujeong-unni, right? And you shot an arrow through his hand, didn’t you?”

I nodded silently at Kim Han-byeol’s words. Back then, I was preparing for the worst-case scenario. If Woo Jeong-min and Seon Yu-un had come at us with everything they had, unless I revealed my full strength, at least one or two of us would’ve died. That’s why I was ready to take one of them down first if things went south.

“And An-hyeon-oppa blocked the dagger with his shield.”

“That’s right.”

“Everyone was praising An-hyeon-oppa, saying he was amazing, thanking him. But do you know what they’re saying about your actions today?”

“…”

I had a vague guess about what was coming, but I didn’t want to hear it. Before I could open my mouth, Kim Han-byeol spoke first.

“They’re not saying it out loud, but they’re clearly shocked. An-sol was so scared she was practically in tears. An-hyeon-oppa and Yujeong-unni looked shaken too. And that’s not all—they’re not happy about how bluntly you spoke to that woman today.”

“Hm. I see.”

When I nodded calmly, Kim Han-byeol’s face briefly flashed with exasperation.

“‘Hm. I see’? That’s not the point! Don’t you feel it’s unfair? You did it to protect Unni, but they’re acting like they don’t want to talk about it, pushing it onto me instead. Don’t you feel like they have no right to say those things?”

Was that how it was? I must’ve been too lost in thought to notice the subtle shift in the group’s mood. I felt a twinge of disappointment, but I didn’t want to dwell on it too much. After all, once we enter the Hall Plane, sooner or later, they’ll have to face killing someone themselves.

Seeing my calm demeanor, Kim Han-byeol spoke in a soothing tone, as if frustrated.

“You’re always thinking alone, worrying alone. You try to take on all the heavy burdens by yourself. I know you don’t have any bad intentions.”

“There seems to be a misunderstanding. Hold on…”

“It’s not about misunderstandings. Like I said before, your judgments have always been reliable. I believe in them too.”

Her words hit me like a stone dropping in my chest. Ever since we left the city, I’d noticed her watching me intently from time to time—especially when I was discussing plans with An-hyeon. I had brushed it off as nothing back then, but it seemed I’d seriously caught her attention today.

“That’s not true. We…”

“Oppa. Drop the formal speech.”

Her interruption left me momentarily flustered, stumbling over my words. When I looked at her with wide eyes, she glared back, her face full of dissatisfaction.

“Huh? What?”

“I’m telling you to speak casually. You’re so relaxed with the other unnis and oppas, so why are you so formal with me?”

“…Alright.”

For a moment, I was completely thrown off. Me, of all people—a ten-year veteran of the Hall Plane…

Let’s stop there. Whenever I see Kim Han-byeol, I can’t help but think of Han So-yeong, and it shakes me up. It’s not just her Unique Ability, Charisma. There’s something subtle in the way I look at her, a faint emotion. Her aura reminds me so much of someone from when we first met.

I cleared my throat and continued where I left off.

“I don’t always make the decisions. You, me, Hyeon, Sol—we all put our heads together and figure things out.”

“Don’t lie. At least you had the decency not to include Yujeong-unni in that.”

“Hasn’t Hyeon worked harder than me? He was impressive in the fight with those monkeys today.”

“There you go again. That might work on An-hyeon-oppa or Yujeong-unni, but not on me. Don’t try to change the subject so slyly. An-hyeon-oppa and I barely managed to take down two monkeys together. You handled two by yourself *and* helped Yujeong-unni in her fight.”

Her words pierced right through me. She really was like *her*. I couldn’t help but feel a sense of respect. Those occasional glances she gave me—were they her observing me all along? It seemed she came prepared for this conversation.

I sighed inwardly. I decided to hear her out a bit more, and if it came to it, I’d throw a fastball.

“It’s always been like this. In the forest, in the city, and even today with those strangers. You usually take a step back, but when things get dangerous, you’re always the one to step up. If we think of ourselves as a team, you’re the one leading us, the pillar holding us up—not An-hyeon-oppa. That’s why I’m upset. Why should *you* have to hear those things?”

*Is she worried about me?*

“Well, I see it differently. An-hyeon is genuinely impressive. He’s proactive, driven, and makes bold decisions. As for their words, I don’t think it’s worth overthinking. In the end, we’re all leaders in our own way, and the Rite of Passage is about teamwork.”

“Stop it. Why are you acting like this?”

“I don’t know what you’re trying to say.”

Even as I said I didn’t know, my conscience stung. I couldn’t bear to meet Kim Han-byeol’s calm, cold gaze any longer. A chill seemed to radiate from her, like a biting north wind. It was that intense.

“Don’t lie! You’re the one who makes the real decisions and takes the lead! You let An-hyeon-oppa handle the easy, visible stuff, but why do you quietly take on all the hard things alone? Why do people only thank An-hyeon-oppa and call him amazing? Why should they fear you, Su-hyeon-oppa, when you’re the one doing all the dirty work? And why are you trying so hard to hide it?”

“You…”

“If this keeps up, you’ll just keep doing the same thing in the same situations. And we might end up in this same mess again. The important thing is that, whether we realize it or not, we all rely on you a lot. No one would object. So please, be our team’s leader. If there’s a tough problem, whether you think it through alone or we discuss it together, let’s at least act together. If you’re the leader, everyone will follow you without complaint.”

Kim Han-byeol was practically pleading with me now. Honestly, I was still a bit stunned. If it had been Lee Yu-jeong in front of me, I’d have laughed it off as just her personality. But with Kim Han-byeol, I couldn’t quite get a read on her. Even in the midst of this, I was calculating why she’d brought this up to me.

The tense standoff continued, the early morning chill seeping into our bodies. But Kim Han-byeol showed no signs of leaving. No—she wasn’t going to let me go until she got an answer.

I bit my lip lightly and slowly opened my mouth.

“I…”

The morning of the sixth day dawned. An-hyeon, who had taken the last watch, woke everyone up and began preparing to move out. He looked exhausted, stretching his stiff joints. I’d barely slept, keeping my eyes open through the night, but my body wasn’t one to feel fatigue from a single sleepless night.

“Hey. Sleep well?”

I greeted them with a deliberately cheerful morning tone. An-sol jumped at my voice, then bowed her head with an anxious look before scurrying away. In the past, I might’ve chuckled, thinking she was just shy, but seeing her react like that to my face brought a bitter smile.

An-hyeon noticed An-sol’s behavior and scolded her, saying, “What’s with just nodding at your big brother like that?” She lowered her head again, on the verge of tears. Then Lee Yu-jeong stepped in, wrapping her arms around An-sol. As the two bickered playfully, An-sol looked flustered, unsure of what to do.

I stood a step back, quietly watching the scene. It was warm. Truly warm. They could’ve passed for three siblings. Their interactions were so lively and affectionate that they made you forget this was the hellish Rite of Passage.

But there was no place for me in that warmth. And I knew that better than anyone. I was fundamentally different from them. When I cut down a hundred Users in the past, I’d thought to myself—maybe I’m no longer human. Maybe I’d let myself get swept up in their warmth and forgotten who I was for a moment.

*If someone who knew the old me saw me now, they’d probably faint.*

I let out a self-deprecating chuckle. Recalling my dark past seemed to cast a gloom over the mood. Unaware of my thoughts, An-hyeon approached me with a bright grin. From the grumbling behind him, it seemed Lee Yu-jeong had lost their morning banter.

“Hyung, if we keep going today, we’ll reach that Warp Gate or whatever, right?”

“…Yeah.”

“Then let’s get there quick. This might be our last breakfast here, so how about we make it a big one? You should eat a lot too, Hyung.”

I gave a faint smile at An-hyeon’s enthusiastic suggestion, shaking my head.

“No, I’m good. You guys eat breakfast without me.”

“Huh? But…”

“I have a habit of skipping meals before important days. It keeps my senses sharp.”

An-hyeon nodded reluctantly, then turned to Kim Han-byeol. She was still staring into space with a cold expression. My conversation with her from earlier that morning flashed through my mind.

“Han-byeol, what about you for breakfast…?”

“I’m not eating.”

“Huh? Come on, don’t be like that…”

“I said I’m not eating.”

Kim Han-byeol cut An-hyeon off with short, sharp responses before he could finish. Even An-sol, surprised by the exchange, fidgeted nervously. An-hyeon glanced between me and Han-byeol awkwardly, then scratched his head with an embarrassed laugh. Lee Yu-jeong, watching from behind, didn’t dare challenge the tense atmosphere and spoke in a much softer tone than usual.

“Haha… guess it’s just us eating then.”

“Yeah, what can we do? More for us, I guess. Haha… ha. Oppa, Han-byeol, we’re really eating all this…?”

Naturally, neither I nor Kim Han-byeol responded. Even the usually bold Lee Yu-jeong seemed shocked by our silence, pursing her lips like a chicken’s beak. I felt Kim Han-byeol’s gaze on me, but I refused to turn my head, avoiding her eyes. The atmosphere grew even colder.

A lively sixth-day morning.

That morning began with breakfast, where three of us were tiptoeing around the moods of the other two.
