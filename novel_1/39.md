# Chapter 38: To the Hall Plane!

After reactivating the voice amplification magic, he raised his head to face the new users. When he had turned it off earlier, no one except the intended recipient could have heard his words. In stark contrast to his earlier interaction with Park Dong-geol, he now wore a calm, composed expression, devoid of hostility, and spoke quietly.

“I understand you’ve heard some explanations from the angels. I’m also aware that you must have many questions beyond that. However, addressing all your curiosities here and now would take more than a week of sleepless nights.”

*Of course*, I thought, nodding inwardly with conviction. I was eager to enter the User Academy as soon as possible. As if reading my mind, Park Hyeon-woo continued with a string of encouraging words.

“Moreover, having just passed the Rite of Passage, you must be physically exhausted. Since we’ve secured everyone’s agreement, I’ll briefly outline the next steps.”

He cleared his throat and continued without pause.

“In the great city of Barbara, there’s a place called the User Academy. Have any of you new users heard even a little about it from your guide angels?”

He emphasized the word *guide*. The users exchanged glances, and soon, one by one, they began raising their hands. There was a slight murmur, but the number of raised hands steadily grew.

At a glance, it seemed more than half had raised their hands—no, almost everyone except a few. This showed how highly the angels regarded the User Academy. Judging that enough had responded, Hyeon-woo signaled for them to lower their hands and continued.

“Good. This might feel like a repeat for some, but since it’s so important and not everyone has heard it, I’ll explain once more. The User Academy is, as the name suggests, a training institution designed to help new users adapt to and survive in the Hall Plane more easily. Its effectiveness has been recognized, and it’s one of the few official missions granted the authority to award stat points, a first in user-established systems.”

Whoever created it, I had to admit it was impressive. It was rare for a user-created system, not one set by the angels, to gain such recognition.

Hyeon-woo began with the history and purpose of the User Academy, then detailed the training process and the benefits of graduating. To summarize the key points:

The User Academy’s training program lasts three months. Early on, a user’s stats tend to rise quickly. The Academy offers efficient training tailored to each user’s stats and class, far surpassing haphazard self-training in stat growth. Trainees receive a weekly stipend of 20 silver coins. Those who complete the three-month program earn a mission reward of 4 stat points.

Honestly, I was mainly in it for the 4 stat points, but for other users, the package was quite appealing. They’d feed you, house you, train you, and pay you—a fourfold benefit.

After explaining for a while, Hyeon-woo concluded with a note about stat limits. Raising stats depended on personal effort, but each user had a ceiling that varied individually. The stat points earned as rewards were one of the few ways to push past those limits, so it was wise to use them sparingly. With that, he wrapped up his explanation of the User Academy.

“That concludes the basic overview. Originally, we planned to move directly to the Academy’s dormitories after this, but since some of you still seem curious, I’ll take three or four questions.”

The moment he finished, a female user from the ranged combat group swiftly raised her hand. Her urgency piqued my curiosity about what she’d ask. When Hyeon-woo nodded, she stood and spoke cautiously.

“Um… can we… go back home?”

It was a disappointing question, far below my expectations. *That’s all she’s got?* I clicked my tongue at her naivety and glanced at Hyeon-woo. As expected, he looked visibly irritated.

Her question was akin to dismissing everything he’d just explained. With an exasperated sigh, he responded in a dry tone.

“I made it clear earlier that we’re not here to send you back home. If I could, do you think I’d be standing here? That’s something you new users will need to figure out as you navigate the Hall Plane.”

Feeling his disdainful gaze, the woman flushed and quietly sat down. A brief silence followed, but soon a male user from the magic talent group raised his hand. He had a neatly cropped sports cut and an intelligent demeanor. When Hyeon-woo nodded, he stood.

“I understand this world is called the Hall Plane, and we’re called users. It seems this city is Barbara, but are users like us only in this city?”

Hyeon-woo shook his head and answered promptly.

“No. As the angels likely told you, the Hall Plane is divided into four continents. Barbara is the only major city in the Northern Continent. Beyond that, there are four regular cities and eight smaller ones in the Northern Continent, all inhabited by users like us. While the Northern Continent isn’t entirely safe, the areas around these cities are effectively under the control of Korean users.”

“You mentioned Korean users. Does that mean there are users from other countries…?”

“Yes. The Hall Plane isn’t exclusive to Korean users. The Eastern Continent is under Japanese users, the Western under American users, and the Southern under British users. There’s some interaction between continents, but broadly speaking, that’s how it’s divided.”

This question wasn’t entirely useless. As the man bowed slightly and sat, Hyeon-woo scanned the new users with an impassive face. Having said he’d take three or four questions, this might be the last. Most seemed hesitant to speak up.

Then, Hyeon-woo pointed at someone. Turning my head, I saw a female user with her hand raised. When she stood, and I saw her face, I couldn’t help but gasp inwardly. It was Kim Han-byeol. Her calm, cool expression locked onto Hyeon-woo. Knowing her sharp wit, I was gripped with intense curiosity about her question. The boredom I’d felt vanished instantly.

Her delicate lips parted, and a beautiful voice flowed out.

“I heard everyone here will train at the User Academy. What’s the *actual* purpose of our training there?”

The moment she spoke, a murmur rippled through the crowd. Many frowned, thinking it a pointless question. But those who grasped the intent behind her words—only a few—lit up with realization.

I, too, was inwardly impressed by Han-byeol’s piercing question. Even Hyeon-woo, sharp as he was, reacted differently than he had to the first woman’s question. Licking his lips repeatedly, he seemed flustered.

Her question was calculated. *Reason* and *purpose* differ, and *purpose* versus *actual purpose* shifts depending on perspective. She wasn’t simply asking, “Why do we have to train?” She was probing the true intent behind training us and, beyond that, the broader purpose of the User Academy itself.

Hyeon-woo opened his mouth, hesitated, and closed it again—a stark contrast to his earlier confidence. The crowd, sensing his odd demeanor, fell silent. Finally, he spoke in a slightly uneasy tone.

“…I’ve already explained the utility of the User Academy. Are you dissatisfied with the training?”

“I’m not expressing dissatisfaction. I agree with joining the Academy. What I want to know isn’t its justification. Is it *truly* just a training space for helping new users adapt?”

I saw Hyeon-woo’s mouth clamp shut. Her words from the Hall Plane hut echoed in my mind: *“You’re doing it again. That might work on An-hyeon oppa or Yu-jeong unni, but not on me. Don’t try to subtly change the subject.”*

He’d tried to sidestep, but Han-byeol’s direct question left him speechless. After a long silence, chewing his lips, he gave a wry smile—the first genuine emotion I’d seen from him in the Hall Plane. Had her question struck that deep a chord?

“…You’ll naturally find out in time, whether you like it or not.”

He wet his dry lips and continued in a low voice.
