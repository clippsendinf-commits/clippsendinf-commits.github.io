# Chapter 115: Interesting

The time had come. After lingering on her chest for a while, I slowly released the soft mound I had been savoring. As I drew my head back, her pale breast, now flushed a distinct reddish hue, came into view. The hardened peak, glistening with my saliva, reflected the light dazzlingly.

I shifted my gaze downward. Both she and I had long since shed all our clothes, bare as the day we were born. When I gently grasped her tightly closed legs, the tension in her thighs began to ease. And there, between her beautiful hips, her most precious place was finally revealed.

Her intimacy wasn’t lascivious but rather exuded a refined, almost delicate charm. Neatly trimmed hair, a tightly sealed valley, and delicate, dew-like threads seeping through the crevice.

“Su-hyeon…”

Ha-yeon’s pleading voice reached my ears, and I nodded once before positioning myself in front of her. The foreplay had been more than enough. No further prelude was necessary. She wanted me, and I wanted her.

Spreading her legs further apart, I slid my own beneath her thighs, wedging them into the gap of the bed. As I did, her tightly closed valley parted slightly, and I guided my hardened self toward it.

This wasn’t my first time. In fact, I had considerable experience from my first cycle—love shared with another, paid encounters, and even forceful acts, though those were only with vagabonds. That experience hadn’t gone anywhere, and I found her entrance with ease, without fumbling.

“Gently… please.”

“You might feel a bit of pain. The more you tense up, the more it could hurt, so try to relax as much as possible.”

Perhaps sensing my arousal brushing against her lower abdomen, Ha-yeon gazed at me with an anxious expression. I soothed her with a languid voice, grasping her slender waist with both hands. At the same time, I applied gentle pressure to my arousal at her entrance.

“Hnng…!”

The tip of my arousal breached her just slightly. Savoring the smooth sensation of her inner walls, I refrained from pushing further. I waited for her to adjust. Ha-yeon tightened her thighs around me with force before exhaling deeply and relaxing once more.

I kept my eyes on her the entire time. Perhaps feeling my gaze, she lifted her face and gave a faint nod, signaling she was alright.

My heart was pounding now. To my surprise, I realized it wasn’t the thrill of battle but this physical act that was making me feel this way.

“Why…?” Ha-yeon asked, her voice breaking the moment, and my racing heart calmed instantly.

Tilting my head slightly, I slowly pushed my hips forward, beginning to enter her.

“Ah… ah…!”

The deeper I went, the more Ha-yeon instinctively twisted her hips. Her passage was tight, almost constricting, but I pressed forward calmly, parting her warm, smooth flesh. It clung to me tightly, and in that moment—

“Oh…”

“Hng…”

I faltered, pausing as my arousal met resistance. A thin, flexible membrane barred further entry. I swallowed hard. This was… her maidenhead. I called her name softly.

“Ha-yeon.”

Her thighs gripped my waist tightly. Her face contorted in pain, her lips bitten hard. After a moment, she exhaled heavily once more.

“Su… hyeon.”

She answered by calling my name, her expression filled with longing as she gazed at me. Her trembling lips parted, and she spoke with difficulty.

“Me, too… Can I… become one of your precious people?”

Her earnest question left me momentarily stunned. After a brief pause, I responded in a husky voice.

“I’m not as good a person as others might think. At least, that’s how I see myself.”

Ha-yeon listened, her eyes trembling. I took her hand, which lay draped across the bed, and continued.

“But I’m not so heartless as to push away someone who likes me, supports me, or wants to rely on me. I don’t care about those who dislike me or others who don’t matter. I’m too busy looking after those close to me. Is that so bad?”

“No. It’s good. It’s okay,” Ha-yeon said, shaking her head gently.

Emboldened by her response, I spoke with more conviction.

“If you hold on to this feeling, I’ll always cherish you, Ha-yeon. If you truly become one of my precious people… I’d stake my life for you.”

She wasn’t yet one of my precious people—just someone under my protection. Realizing I’d let myself get carried away by the earlier excitement, I sighed inwardly and steadied myself.

But Ha-yeon seemed moved by my words, her face glowing with emotion as she murmured.

“Thank you… Now, come to me.”

“It’ll hurt.”

“I feel like I can endure any pain right now.”

Her words stirred a desire to comfort her. I reached behind her, slipping my hands under her back. Slowly, I lifted her body, though she was still slightly on her toes. In response, Ha-yeon gently wrapped her arms around my head.

“Just… all at once. I think that’d be better.”

I understood her perfectly. Her body was trembling.

In our seated embrace, I carefully lowered her hips. Slowly, cautiously. My arousal, already partially inside, began to push through the delicate membrane. Feeling its elasticity, I pressed her hips down firmly while thrusting upward with force.

Ha-yeon’s body jolted, her arms tightening fiercely around my head and back. Her face, lips bitten so hard they might bleed, came into view. I held her fragile frame close, driving myself deeper. Her weight pressed down from above, and my upward response allowed me to reach her deepest point.

At last, we were one. The pain must have been immense—Ha-yeon’s tear-filled eyes bore it bravely. When I moved my hips slightly, faint ripples spread across her swollen breasts.

“Ah… ah… ugh… ah…”

She tried to relax as I’d advised, but the pain made her tense again, repeating the cycle. Her inner walls, twitching and enveloping me, brought an indescribable comfort—warm and soft.

Savoring the sensation, I began to move my hips gently. Her tightness was evident, but she was trying her best to accept me. When I pulled back slightly and looked down, I saw my arousal, slick with crimson traces. Moving again, her walls clenched tightly, sending waves of intense pleasure through me.

“Hnng… ah… ah…”

Her ragged breathing filled the air, barely able to catch her breath. Each time I thrust, her jet-black hair swayed like waves.

Her slightly parted lips exhaled sweet breaths. I leaned in, kissing her deeply. As our mouths opened, her warm breath flowed into me. Savoring her lips, I gently slipped my tongue inside.

She responded instinctively, her tongue meeting mine. Our tongues entwined, exchanging sweet saliva. Ha-yeon reacted passionately, as if trying to forget the pain in her lower body, eagerly wrapping her tongue around mine.

*Slurp, smack, gulp.* The lewd sounds of our tongues and swallowing filled the quiet room. After soothing her with kisses, I slowly withdrew my tongue and parted our lips. A thin silver thread of saliva stretched between us before snapping.

With that as my cue, I thrust my hips upward with greater force.

The dim morning light filtered through the window, brushing against my face. I opened my eyes slowly. Lifting my head reflexively, I saw Ha-yeon, peacefully asleep with a serene expression. She was holding me tightly, as if cradling a child, making it difficult to move.

I reached out quietly, stroking her hair. Sensing my movement, she stirred slightly, pulling me closer into her embrace. The soft friction of her skin against mine made me draw a gentle breath. We had fallen asleep naked, wrapped in each other’s warmth through the night.

After carefully extricating myself from her arms, I gazed at her lying on the bed. Exhausted from our intimacy, she hadn’t cleaned up and had simply fallen asleep. The sheets bore red stains from her first blood, along with patches of dried, whitish fluid—likely my release mixed with her blood.

Seeing the traces of our night together, I gave a wry smile. It wouldn’t matter much to leave it as is, but just in case, I carefully tidied up around her, taking care not to disturb her. The rest could be handled by Yeon-ju when Ha-yeon awoke. I covered her with a blanket as she breathed softly, then grabbed my sword and left the room.

As I descended the stairs to the first floor, I tilted my head, noticing a strange sensation. Yesterday, I’d felt a subtle fatigue lingering in my body, but today, I felt oddly refreshed.

That wasn’t all. The Fire Essence within me pulsed vigorously, and I felt a surge of vitality coursing through my veins. My endurance and stamina were high—72 points in Hall Plane stats were far from low—so a strong recovery was expected, but this felt different, almost inexplicable.

“Could it be… pent-up frustration?” I muttered, the thought of my night with Ha-yeon flashing through my mind before I shook my head vigorously.

Reaching the first floor, I saw Yeon-ju bustling about with an empty plate, despite the absence of any users. It seemed odd for her to be so busy with no one around, but it wasn’t my concern.

*Thud, thud.*

The sound of my footsteps echoed through the lobby. Hearing someone approach, Yeon-ju turned and began to greet me—then stopped.

“You’re up late today… Oh? What’s with that expression?”

“What?”

Her sudden shift in tone caught me off guard, and I responded with a question. Narrowing her eyes, she continued in a languid voice.

“Your face is practically screaming, *‘Why’s she so busy when there’s no one here?’*”

She’s sharp as ever. I shook my head, denying it.

“It’s probably a misunderstanding.”

“Probably? Not *definitely*?”

“Maybe.”

With a cryptic expression, I shrugged and pulled out a chair at a nearby table. As I sat, Yeon-ju’s sharp gaze lingered on me. Ignoring it, I spoke calmly.

“A-course.”

“Really, like this?”

“The others will be down soon, so add six more portions.”

“Hmph.”

She bit her lip slightly at my words, then spun the plate she was holding with force. Catching it deftly with her fingertips, she twirled it skillfully and spoke in a slightly raised, but still soft, tone.

“Hmph. I was about to share some good info since you’re a regular, but…”

“A regular, huh? What’s the info?”

“Forget it. Time’s up. I’m *really* annoyed now.”

I gave her a deadpan look, pulling two cigarettes from my pocket. She moved to stop me, but I tossed one to her, silencing her protest. While still spinning the plate, she caught the cigarette in her mouth with impressive skill. Truly befitting the Shadow Queen. I responded to her flair with a flick of my fingers.

*Snap.*

A faint spark ignited at the tips of our cigarettes, flaring briefly before fading. In that fleeting moment, I caught a glint in Yeon-ju’s eyes.

“Thanks. But one cigarette isn’t enough to soothe my irritation.”

“Alright.”

Her brow furrowed at my curt reply, but she soon let out a languid laugh and continued.

“This info’s a big deal… I don’t share it with just anyone…”

She trailed off, leaving an opening, but I ignored it, taking a deep drag from my cigarette. Undeterred, she pressed on.

“But since you’re a favorite customer… If you say, *‘Please tell me, big sis!’* in a cute voice, I might consider it.”

“…Sigh.”

Realizing she’d keep talking endlessly if I let her, I exhaled a sharp puff of smoke through my nose. After a moment, I spoke in a flat tone, my eyes likely sinking into a deep calm.

“Halo.”

“…What?”

Her face flushed with sudden panic at the mention of Halo. Sighing, I spoke again.

“SSUN. Vagabond extermination.”

The moment I finished, she dropped the spinning plate. It shattered with a loud crash, and I gave a faint smile.
