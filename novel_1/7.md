# Memorize - Episode 6 (6/1068): Using the Special Privilege

As the Essence of Fire slid down my throat, it burned. The moment it reached the mana flowing gently within my body, the Essence reacted for the first time.

*Whoosh! Whoosh!*

The Essence, sparked by the mana, transformed into a fierce blaze, swelling with uncontrollable momentum. Its energy was pure and potent, carrying the unmistakable scent of flame—so intense I could feel it in my bones.

*Boom…!*

The initial reaction was relatively mild. Even so, my body convulsed, bulging outward as it spewed fiery energy. It was clear my body couldn’t fully contain this sudden surge, forcing the excess outward. Each twitch sent sparks flying in all directions, my body jerking intermittently.

From somewhere nearby, I faintly heard Seraph chanting a spell. I barely managed to raise a hand toward her, signaling her not to interfere.

Seraph wasn’t wrong. Controlling the Essence’s energy with my current abilities was a distant dream. I might succeed by using the Ancient Priestess’s Stigma, but I had no intention of relying on it yet. No, more accurately, I never planned to suppress the Essence with the stigma in the first place. The stigma’s role was to provide a space for the Essence’s energy, my future companion, to reside—nothing more, nothing less.

What I sought wasn’t suppression or control. What human could possibly contain a power rivaling the flames of hell itself?

But if I reframed it as borrowing that power, the situation changed.

I cracked my eyes open and caught a faint glimpse of Seraph. She was stomping her feet in agitation. The sight of an angel so flustered was oddly refreshing, but I quickly grimaced. I knew this was merely the prelude, and the real challenge was about to begin.

Comparing the Essence’s explosions to ordinary ones would be a mistake. These weren’t physical blasts but eruptions of pure energy, accompanied by incomparable power and pain. And now, the Essence began its true rampage within me.

*Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!*

“Urgh. Grrk.”

The successive explosions made my eyes roll back involuntarily. The pain from this full-scale onslaught was beyond imagination. In my ten years in the Hall Plane, I’d endured countless wounds and agonies, but they felt like child’s play compared to this. The dread of even greater pain to come sent chills down my spine, but I gritted my teeth harder with each wave.

In my mind, I repeated endlessly: *I am Kim Su-hyeon, a user who has seen the end of the Hall Plane.* Those ten years of relentless endurance, the pride of holding the Zero Code—none of it was earned through mere bravado.

Was the sound of explosions leaking out, or was Seraph speaking? The surroundings were a chaotic blur, barely audible. With every passing moment, the Essence steadily amplified its energy. As it prepared to unleash another explosion, I summoned all my strength, channeling my vast mana—nearing 90 points—to bolster its power.

As my mana surged into it, the Essence paused its impending explosion, if only for a moment. In that fleeting instant, I allowed myself a faint smile. My mana had seamlessly merged with the Essence’s energy.

A pure embodiment of fire. An eternal flame. The Essence was a sentient force, akin to ego equipment that chooses its master, yet distinct in its autonomy. It could wield its power at will or withhold it entirely. Though it lacked a self-aware ego, it possessed emotions. And now, through the fusion of my mana, I was communing with its fiery spirit.

The Essence’s current emotion was bewilderment. Typically, one would try to suppress a force wreaking havoc within. But I was doing the opposite, facilitating its rampage, extending a hand in partnership. I wasn’t trying to subdue it but to borrow its strength as an equal. With desperate sincerity, I called out in my heart:

*I need you. So go ahead, unleash your power. Judge for yourself if I’m worthy to be your partner, and show me the result.*

At that, I earned a brief respite. I exhaled a scorching breath, flames flickering from my nostrils.

*Alright. I understand.*

Finally, I had the Essence’s consent.

After steadying myself, I guided the eager, almost playful Essence to its next destination. The first targets were my arms. I swiftly directed its energy down both limbs, guiding it along the pathways of my meridians and blood vessels. The Essence surged forward like a tidal wave, occupying every inch down to the tiniest capillaries in my fingertips in an instant.

*Bubble! Bubble!*

*Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!*

A pleasant ache coursed through me as my blood vessels seemed to burst open. The sound of clogged pathways clearing was exhilarating. Even forcing them open, the effect was profound—clearing even the finest meridians in my fingertips, something my past Master-level body couldn’t achieve.

At the same time, yellowish pus and dark, viscous liquid seeped from the skin of my arms, only to evaporate in the heat. The impurities and waste hidden deep within my body were incinerated, deemed obstacles by the Essence’s passage. Normally, I’d have rejoiced, but there was no time for that now.

Even just channeling it into my arms left me dizzy, but I gently coaxed the energy back toward my core. Thankfully, the Essence, having lost interest in the now-cleared arms, followed my will obediently. As the energy drained from my arms, they went limp, sensation lost to the overwhelming shock.

A fleeting worry crossed my mind—would I lose my arms?—but I had no desire to turn back. Soothing the impatient Essence, I hurriedly guided it toward my legs. As it neared its destination, I gave it a gentle nudge, and it surged downward like a wild wave once more.

*Bubble! Bubble!*

*Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!*

The process was no different from my arms, and the result was the same. As the Essence’s energy withdrew from my legs, they too lost sensation, collapsing powerlessly beneath me. With my current endurance, stamina, and mana stats, it seemed my body could barely maintain its form without breaking apart.

But the Essence, like a fish in water, continued its gleeful rampage, triggering explosions within me. I was on the verge of losing my mind. The pain pounding through my body made me want to pass out, but superhuman endurance kept my consciousness tethered, if only by a thread.

*Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!*

Each explosion sent my heart racing and my blood boiling. Sensing the Essence’s urging—*No more places to play?*—I steeled myself and asked it to gather more energy. The next destination, the final hurdle, was my head.

For the first time, fear gripped me as I faced my head. This wasn’t a fear that could be tamed. Whether I succeeded or failed in clearing this pathway, the pain would be unimaginable. Then, I heard it.

*If you don’t want to, shall we stop? You don’t have to go all the way to your head. What you’ve done is already enough.*

It was as if the Essence whispered slyly in my ear. For a moment, I nearly nodded, but I shook my head firmly. My reason screamed to stop, but instinct drove me to guide the energy upward toward my head.

*You fool. You might die.*

“With just this much?”

I was ready to proceed.

*Don’t do it. Don’t do it. Don’t do it.*

My mind begged me to stop, but I ignored it, acting on instinct alone. With a final, desperate shout, I sent the Essence toward the pathway to my head.

“Don’t underestimate me!”

I hadn’t meant to speak, but my will was clear. The energy at my core began to spin vigorously, gathering strength before surging downward to my dantian, just below my navel, where it paused.

Summoning every ounce of strength, I propelled the energy upward. As the Essence charged toward my throat in a spectacular explosion, I gasped.

“Guh!”

*Spurt!*

Dark red blood sprayed from every orifice—nose, mouth, ears, eyes. My instincts screamed a warning; this felt like death itself.

*Whoosh! Whoosh!*

The Essence’s energy, blocked at my throat, raged fiercely. An explosion here would bring a horrifying reality. Dizziness overwhelmed me, my body plummeting into an abyss.

I knew this was the end. In my haze, I gathered the energy swirling at my throat and pulled it back to my dantian. Miraculously, it obeyed.

*I have to break through, no matter what.*

One… two… three… ten times, I spun the rampant energy, taming it. With a final resolve, I sent it soaring toward my head, heedless of the pain to come.

*Bang!*

A violent shock rocked my body. The pathway through my throat cleared, and the Essence’s energy flooded my head in an instant, enveloping it entirely.

*

My vision went blank. That was all. In that moment, my sight flickered out, leaving the world a blinding white. I felt nothing, saw nothing—a state as if my memories had been severed and stitched back together.

*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*

I barely registered the situation. The Essence’s energy rampaged through my head, as if sulking for my resistance. It felt like my brain was melting.

Pain? When the pathway first opened, there was a fleeting sense of clarity, like a dam bursting. But as my vision slowly returned and sensation crept back, I felt it—a pain I never wanted to experience again in my lifetime.

*Haaaaaaa!*

If I could scream, I would have roared until my lungs gave out. This was a stimulus beyond what any ordinary human could endure, a sensation from another dimension. Was this what it felt like to plunge my head into a blazing furnace? To douse myself in oil and leap into flames? Despite all my battles—on land, sea, air, and in cities—this moment made me genuinely wish for death.

A massive surge of energy engulfed my entire body, a blast unlike any before. The eternal flame, starting from my head, claimed my insides bit by bit, as if declaring, *You’re mine now.* Where its energy touched, every cell sizzled, yet the pain began to feel oddly warm.

After some time, my vision cleared slightly. My body remained immobile. Lifting my impossibly heavy eyelids, I saw Seraph staring down at me, her face pale with shock.

*Is he even alive…?*

If I had to endure that pain again, I’d rather die.

The final task—compared to opening my head—was relatively straightforward. I gently guided the Essence’s energy, now spread throughout my body, toward my heart. Whether it approved of me or not, the Essence complied willingly.

Only then did the Ancient Priestess’s Stigma activate. Satisfied with its rampage, the Essence settled into my heart. The moment I felt it take root, I lost consciousness, too overwhelmed to even feel relief.
