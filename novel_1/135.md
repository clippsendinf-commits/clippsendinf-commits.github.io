# Memorize - Chapter 134: Growing Even More Mature

“Hoo.”

“Hoo~.”

Go Yeon-ju and I sat side by side on the stairs, exhaling smoke at the same time. Her face had a sullen expression the entire time she smoked her cigarette. It seemed like she had genuinely tried to hide this time, but since I easily saw through it, she was reacting this way. If it weren’t for my Third Eye, or if I were the me from my first cycle, I probably wouldn’t have noticed so quickly.

We were both puffing away at our cigarettes in silence. Go Yeon-ju didn’t seem inclined to speak first. So, after flicking off some ash, I quietly broke the silence.

“Why exactly were you hiding there?”

“When I felt such a strong mana fluctuation on the second floor, how could I not go up and check?”

Her tone was sharp in response to my question. Mana fluctuation—did she mean mana detection? I nodded once and continued.

“Well, then you could’ve just taken a quick look and left, or come out when you saw me. There was no need to hide.”

“Tch.”

This time, she didn’t have a comeback and clicked her tongue, conceding defeat. Her reaction brought a faint smile to my lips. Alright. Once we finish these cigarettes, I’ll head up to the special room…

“You know, if you think about it… User Kim Su-hyeon, you’re kind of clueless, aren’t you?”

Just as I was thinking the day would end on a good note, Go Yeon-ju launched a new counterattack. Her words made me let out a wry chuckle. Me, clueless? Me, who’s survived ten years rolling through the muck of Hall Plane? Clueless? It was such absurd nonsense that I couldn’t help but let out a silent smile, not even worth responding to.

But Go Yeon-ju didn’t seem to think so. Seeing my chuckle, she gave me a dumbfounded look and said, “What’s with that incredulous laugh? Don’t tell me you actually think you’re not clueless?”

“It’s just amusing, that’s all.”

“So, you’re saying you think you *are* perceptive.”

“Probably. I’d say I’m a lot better than most users.”

Go Yeon-ju tilted her head, looking at me like I was completely off the mark. Then she turned slightly, placing a hand on my shoulder, and began speaking in a serious tone.

“Look, User Kim Su-hyeon. I’m sorry to say this, but you’re *really* clueless. I’m not talking about the kind of perceptiveness you use in combat or other practical matters. I mean the kind of perceptiveness a man has toward a woman. Got it?”

“Haha. That’s more An-hyeon’s thing, isn’t it?”

Her blunt response left Go Yeon-ju with a flabbergasted expression. She shook her head vigorously for a moment before raising her voice slightly. Seeing her flustered like this was a first, and it was kind of entertaining.

“No! That kid is *way* more perceptive than you, at least. Trust me on this. And you’d better work on it, or you’re going to get into real trouble.”

“Oh, come on. What kind of trouble? And I’ll say it again—I *am* perceptive. You don’t need to worry so much.”

“Haa…”

Go Yeon-ju placed a hand on her forehead and let out a long sigh at my words. Muttering to herself, “To think I’d discover a weakness like this… No, not a weakness, a flaw, maybe?” she flicked away her finished cigarette. Looks like the innkeeper doesn’t care much for her own inn. I took another drag from my remaining cigarette.

Even after finishing her cigarette, Go Yeon-ju didn’t get up. It seemed she wanted to talk more. She’s saying *I’m* clueless when I’m reading her intentions this clearly? I snorted inwardly and decided to wait for her to continue.

Sure enough, as I stubbed out my cigarette, her lips parted softly, as expected.

“So, you went to see her, huh?”

By “went to see her,” she meant Yu-jeong. Go Yeon-ju had been against me going, but I prioritized my own judgment and went to comfort Yu-jeong.

“Yeah, as you saw.”

“I didn’t see or hear anything. By the way, I told you not to go…”

As she trailed off, I took a moment to gather my thoughts. Dragging this issue out wouldn’t do any good. Whether she knew it or not, it’d be better to just lay out my reasoning clearly. So, in a calm voice, I spoke.

“Yes, you did. But I thought going was the right call.”

“Why?”

“Because we don’t have much time left.”

Go Yeon-ju immediately fell silent at my response. Those words carried a multitude of implications. I glanced at her. She was resting her chin in her hand, staring ahead, mulling over what I’d said.

“Not much time left… Hmm…”

Go Yeon-ju murmured to herself, tapping her cheek with one finger. Her elegantly poised fingers supported her face. Without realizing it, I activated my enhanced vision to observe her closely.

Beautiful.

Her smooth skin, like snow tinged with peach, and the faint blush on her cheeks. Her eyebrows were delicately arched, and her eyes, gazing ahead, seemed to draw me in with their deep intensity. Go Yeon-ju exuded a truly fatal charm.

“Hm…?”

Perhaps sensing my gaze, she blinked a few times and turned her head sharply. Her wavy hair swayed with the motion. The moment our eyes met in the air, she gave a faint smile. Her eyes curved into beautiful arcs, and her lovely vermilion lips parted in a gentle crescent.

“Why are you staring at me like that? Falling for me?”

“…Let’s say I almost did.”

Nodding in acknowledgment, she gave me a surprised look and said, “Ha, really? What’s with you today? Back when I was trying so hard to seduce you, you wouldn’t budge.”

“Who knows.”

I gave a vague reply, letting out an awkward smile. The reason I’d been momentarily captivated was that her appearance reminded me of Han So-yeong. Han So-yeong had a habit of resting her chin in her hand and tapping her cheek when deep in thought. Come to think of it, what was Han So-yeong doing right now?

Thinking of her brought a sigh to my lips. Go Yeon-ju, who had been watching me, slightly lifted her hips and scooted closer, leaning her head on my shoulder. In a soft voice, she spoke.

“Alright. I don’t fully understand what you mean, but I don’t think you’re clueless enough to miss my point entirely. I’m sure you have your reasons. Your actions will bear results soon enough, so I’ll keep an eye on things. But remember, this matter doesn’t depend on you—it depends on that little one.”

“That’s true. Thanks for the kind words, though.”

Her words implied that the request I’d made back then was still valid. Relieved, I let out a breath. If she changed her mind, Yu-jeong’s resolve could be for naught. Well, maybe not entirely for naught, but it might lose some of its shine.

At my words, Go Yeon-ju gave a sly smile and said, “Just words?”

“…?”

“I’ve lent you the inn, fed you breakfast, given you rides, kept an eye on things, and now I’m even going to teach the kid. Have you ever seen a tree that gives so generously?”

“Nope, haven’t seen one. But you’re not a tree.”

Even I thought it was a pointless jab. But the moment I said it, a glint flashed in Go Yeon-ju’s eyes. Did I mess up again? A wave of unease crept up, and I swallowed hard. She grinned mischievously and leaned in closer. I could feel her warm breath on my neck.

“That’s right, I’m not a tree. I’m a person—a user—so I think I deserve some kind of payment.”

“Didn’t we agree to settle the payment later?”

“In mutual transactions, a deposit is only common courtesy, dear customer.”

Our shoulders were already touching, and as she raised her head and leaned in, the distance between us shrank even further. Her relentless back-and-forth banter made me feel a growing tension inside.

Calming myself, I spoke in a steady voice.

“Please take good care of Yu-jeong for a while. She’s a user with a lot of potential.”

“If she comes to me herself, sure. And don’t try to subtly change the subject. You always dodge when you’re at a disadvantage. Hey, why are you already shifting? No one’s going to eat you! I’m not done yet. Where do you think you’re sneaking off to?”

“…The person who’s supposed to teach the kid starting tomorrow shouldn’t act like this.”

“Oh, I’m the kind of teacher who accepts bribes.”

“That’s not a funny joke. I’ll be heading up now—”

“—da.” Before I could finish, Go Yeon-ju’s face lunged toward me. It looked like she was aiming for a kiss, so I jerked my head back. That’s when it happened.

*Swish. Swish.*

As if she’d anticipated my move, her body vanished, leaving only an afterimage. I couldn’t sense her presence at all. It was a split second—one or two at most. The distance was too close to activate my Third Eye in time. I had no time to curse my mistake. Trusting my instincts, I quickly turned my head.

First, to the left. Nothing. Then…

“Hup.”

The moment I turned to the right, I gasped. A warm, soft sensation pressed against my lips. She’d timed it perfectly, her face appearing just as I turned.

“…”

In my first cycle, I’d once thought about what it’d be like to kiss her. Now, her lips were pressed against mine. Her face, grinning triumphantly, was right in front of me. Seeing my expression, she pulled back with a strong purse of her lips, making a smacking sound.

*Smack.*

“Ho ho. Finally got that kiss.”

“How did you… just now…”

I asked with a wry expression, and she wagged her finger playfully before speaking in an excited tone.

“I figured it out when we sparred before. I needed to close the distance first. If I gave you time to react, I’d definitely lose. So, it was a 25% chance—up, down, left, right. I went left first, then immediately to the right and waited. And as you turned, I just leaned in with my lips.”

“…Ha. All that calculation just for a kiss? That’s meticulous.”

“Why the sigh? Was kissing me that bad? Are you upset?”

As I sighed, she tilted her head and spoke. Her face was still smiling, but there was something odd in her tone. At that moment, I recalled a conversation we’d had before.

*“Yes, I was a bar girl.”*

*“What does User Kim Su-hyeon think of someone like me?”*

*“In the modern world, a woman who worked at a bar, looked down on by others…”*

*“Look at their eyes. You can tell what someone’s thinking by looking at their eyes.”*

“…No.”

The warmth of her lips still lingered on mine. I shook my head and stood up. Looking down at her, I saw her glaring at me playfully.

“So, was it good?”

“Honestly, it wasn’t bad. Kissing the famous Shadow Queen, after all.”

“Ho ho. Getting a bit honest now, are we?”

Seeing her mischievous grin, I took a bold step forward and grabbed her collar firmly.

“Eek.”

“For the record, I don’t do calculations for stuff like this.”

At my declaration, her eyes widened. I leaned forward, pulling her collar toward me.

“Eup…!”

It was a bit rough, but that enchanting sensation lingered on my lips again. Her breath and lips carried a faint cigarette scent. At first, she looked surprised, but soon she closed her eyes and leaned into the kiss.

This kiss didn’t last long. It felt like it could escalate to tongues if it went on, so I pulled back. But her lips were so soft that, even after just ten seconds, they clung to mine as if reluctant to let go.

I released her collar, adjusted her clothes, and spoke.

“…How was that?”

Go Yeon-ju didn’t answer right away. She opened her eyes quietly, looking at me with a calm gaze I’d never seen before. Then, she licked her lips lightly with her tongue.

After savoring the moment, she spoke in a low voice.

“If it were someone like An-sol or Yu-jeong, they’d be blushing and stomping their feet. But not me. If you thought you’d see me flustered by just this, you’re mistaken.”

“I see.”

“But I’ll take back what I said about you being clueless. You’re not a shy boy—you’re a sly fox. Hmph.”

“Hahaha.”

I let out a hearty laugh and turned around. It was time to head back. The thought of organizing my equipment list no longer appealed. I just wanted to return to bed or swing my sword.

As I climbed the stairs and reached for the door, Go Yeon-ju’s voice called out from behind.

“But… why did you kiss me back? Because I got you, so you wanted to get me back?”

She emphasized the word *back*. I turned my head slightly, shrugged, and replied.

“Who knows. Maybe something like that. I guess I was curious what it’d feel like to kiss the Shadow Queen myself, rather than being kissed by her.”

Her expression turned subtle at my response. I didn’t add, “The me from my first cycle, that is.”
