# Chapter 125: A Small Rebellion

After a round of drinks where everyone quenched their thirst, I began my explanation. The clan I intended to create would have two defining characteristics: a small, elite group and the operational style of free mercenaries based on accepting requests. The concept of a small, elite group needed no further explanation, but Go Yeon-ju and Ha-yeon showed keen interest in the idea of free mercenaries.

The users listening to me were not naive children unaware of the ways of the world. Thus, I felt the need to provide a more detailed explanation of how the identity of free mercenaries would bring significant advantages moving forward. I calmly organized the events that would unfold in the future.

The partial success of the Vagabond Extermination Plan, though not a complete eradication, allowing some vagabonds to escape. The failure of the Golden Lion Clan and its allied clans’ expedition to the Steel Mountains, resulting in a loss of strength. Consequently, the weakening of control over the Northern Continent, including the major city of Barbara. The Golden Lion Clan issuing a summons, but some cities, excluding allied clans, declaring independence. The rise of vagabonds seizing this opportunity. The participation of some Western Continent users leading to the capture of western cities and Barbara. Ultimately, the dissolution of the Golden Lion Clan, with allied clans either disbanding or fleeing.

This was the sequence of events that actually occurred in my first cycle. After Barbara’s capture, other general city clans attempted to retake it but were defeated by the combined forces of Western Continent users and vagabonds. Only then did other clans realize the gravity of the situation, forming a coalition that eventually succeeded in recapturing Barbara.

I explained this series of events to everyone. Of course, I didn’t reveal everything. My focus was on emphasizing the high likelihood of the Steel Mountains expedition failing, the rise of the vagabonds, and the consequences these would bring. My companions and Go Yeon-ju let out deep sighs. The initial excitement in the room had vanished, replaced by a heavy silence that lingered over the table where we sat. Even for users familiar with the state of the Hall Plane, my words carried too many uncertain factors to be taken at face value—a point I acknowledged. In short, while my explanation made sense, the critical events I described inevitably prompted skepticism: “Would things really escalate that far?”

But Go Yeon-ju’s presence here was a masterstroke (though not intentional on my part). As a fifth-year user, one of the <Ten Strongest>, the Shadow Queen with a Secret Class, and known as a walking information hub, her evaluation of my plan was crucial. Her judgment would serve as a gauge of whether my words held realistic potential or were mere fantasy.

Shin Sang-yong tilted his head with a puzzled expression. The scale of the discussion seemed too grand for him to grasp fully—a pure scholar type who didn’t quite mesh with such topics. Ha-yeon’s reaction was similarly ambiguous. She understood my words but found it hard to accept them outright. However, since I was the one speaking, she refrained from challenging me directly.

I had anticipated their reactions. I hadn’t planned to reveal this much initially, but Go Yeon-ju’s presence prompted me to share more about future events. I turned to her, and seeing her serious expression, I smiled inwardly.

With a frown, Go Yeon-ju smacked her lips, then grabbed an entire bottle of liquor from the table. Parting her pretty lips slightly, she brought the bottle to her mouth. Before anyone could stop her, she tilted it back and downed it in one go.

*Gulp, gulp.*

Shin Sang-yong stared at her, dumbfounded, as she chugged the full bottle. Streams of liquor spilled from her mouth, running down her neck and soaking her chest. Finishing the bottle cleanly, she placed it back on the table, letting out a sweet, satisfied sigh as if her parched throat had finally been soothed.

Go Yeon-ju let out a hollow laugh before speaking, looking at me. “Goodness… I came here thinking I’d just listen to some casual talk, but this is like a bolt from the blue… User Kim Su-hyeon.”

“Hm,” I responded with a nod. She opened her mouth, her expression suggesting she was struggling.

“You’re a terrifying user,” she said. Her words could be interpreted in various ways, but at least she didn’t dismiss my claims as absurd. As one of the <Ten Strongest>, her presence here suggested she wasn’t thrilled about the expedition either. Taking advantage of that, I spoke quietly.

“In what way?”

“For a zero-year user to predict such scenarios is astonishing. Even I couldn’t foresee these events. Or rather… what’s scarier is that you’re planning to exploit those gaps. Not just a combat type, but a strategist too? Or perhaps both?”

Slightly tipsy, Go Yeon-ju shook her head and sank into her chair. Seeing this, Ha-yeon cautiously spoke up. “User Go Yeon-ju… how do you evaluate Su-hyeon’s claims?”

Go Yeon-ju glanced at me with half-lidded eyes before responding in a weary voice. “I don’t know… It’s ambiguous. Honestly, the parts of his claims that can be objectively verified are likely correct. Many clans are already dissatisfied with the Golden Lion Clan, so if their expedition fails, plenty will be clapping in delight. Yes, if the Golden Lion Clan’s control weakens, some clans might show rebellious movements. But…”

She partially endorsed my words. For a <Ten Strongest> user, especially the Shadow Queen renowned for her information-gathering, to lend even partial credibility to my claims was significant. Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong widened their eyes at her words, but she wasn’t finished.

“The part about the vagabonds is something we can’t judge yet. For User Kim Su-hyeon’s claims—and for the clan he plans to create to thrive—the vagabonds need to move exactly as predicted, without a single misstep. Will they really do that?”

“Most likely,” I replied.

“As far as I know, the vagabonds are gathering in large numbers this time. But no matter how it plays out, if we’re talking victory or defeat, it’s 100% the established users’ win. With the extermination plan in place, they’ll aim to wipe out the vagabonds entirely. And you’re saying the vagabonds will escape to the Western Continent, rally its users, and launch an invasion?”

I gave a faint smile at her words. To put it bluntly, the Vagabond Extermination Plan ends in the first phase. They achieve a major victory in the initial battle but grow complacent and shift focus to preparing for the expedition. Of course, the users suffer significant losses too. SSUN, the representative clan of the western city Halo—one of the Golden Lion Clan’s allies—takes a massive hit.

In other words, the surviving vagabonds band together, flee to the Western Continent, gain their support, and attempt an invasion using the western route. I organized my thoughts briefly before speaking.

“With their attention consumed by the Steel Mountains expedition, do you think they’d bother chasing down fleeing vagabonds? These aren’t the type to be easily caught—they’re skilled at survival.”

“…Fine. What about the Western Continent’s support? I know what kind of people they are, but I’m not sure they’d risk crossing continents.”

“With Halo as the battleground, the only place to flee is the Western Continent. Crawling back into the Northern Continent would be suicide. Crossing once is tough, but I don’t think the vagabonds will just flee quietly. They’ll be hell-bent on revenge, likely carving out a path to connect the continents—or creating a route. It’s not like there’s no precedent for crossings. If the Northern Continent’s vagabonds sacrifice themselves to secure a route, don’t you think some among them would see it as a viable opportunity?”

“Hmm…” Go Yeon-ju nodded, her expression suggesting she found my words plausible, and tapped her lips lightly. I promptly offered her a cigarette, naturally taking one for myself as well.

*Whoosh, exhale.*

After exhaling a puff of smoke, she spoke again. “So, the key to your claims about the vagabonds’ movements is the early termination of the extermination plan. Given their nature… *chuckle*, a user who calculates both user and vagabond tendencies. You’re getting scarier. But there’s definitely some plausibility. If that happens, the Northern Continent will fall into chaos, and a clan with free mercenary traits would have a vastly expanded range of activity. I’m really looking forward to seeing what kind of user you’ll become. But I have a few more questions.”

She said all this rapidly. Though she appeared calm, her slightly disjointed speech suggested her mind was racing. Honestly, I wasn’t calculating anything—I was just recounting events that happened in the future. Still, it seemed she was acknowledging one part and reserving judgment on another. I waited quietly for her next words.

“Will your clan really be able to build a reputation? Even with your impressive achievements for your years, joining a newly formed clan carries a lot of uncertainty.”

“That’s why I said it’d be a small, elite group. We have no intention of accepting just anyone.”

“Arrogant, aren’t you?”

“That arrogance is backed by factors that make it viable. One Secret Class, two Rare Classes, and skilled or promising users. Who could ignore such a free-moving force?”

At the mention of one Secret Class and two Rare Classes, I saw Go Yeon-ju’s eyes waver. Her expression hardened instantly, and she fell silent.

She spoke again only after I’d finished my cigarette. Muttering “Secret… Rare Classes…” to herself, she opened her mouth with a complex expression. “I’ve heard your explanation. Can I ask one more thing?”

“Go ahead.”

“Why are you telling me all this? I get why you’d tell those two—they’re your companions. But I’m just an unrelated user.”

I didn’t answer immediately. Instead, I turned and looked steadily at Shin Sang-yong and Ha-yeon. Understanding the meaning of my gaze, they hesitated briefly but soon rose from their seats. Shin Sang-yong spoke first.

“Leader, I don’t know how you’ll take this, but I really like the idea of your caravan. And I don’t want to lose my mentor. If you’re okay with it, I’d like to stay with you moving forward.”

“Su-hyeon, I’ve already told you my feelings before. I don’t fully grasp everything you said today, but since I’ve chosen to trust you, I’ll continue to do so.”

After confirming their intent to join, I nodded with a gentle expression. “I originally wanted to discuss this more slowly, but it seems we need to settle some things first. I wouldn’t have brought up these matters if I didn’t intend to accept you both. So, I look forward to working with you. And thanks for your hard work today.”

“Hard work? Every day’s been fun,” Shin Sang-yong said with a hearty laugh. I chuckled and continued, “Then I’ll see you both tomorrow morning.”

“Yes, we’ll head out now,” they replied, bowing lightly before walking away. Just before leaving, Ha-yeon glanced back at me and Go Yeon-ju with a worried expression. I signaled that it was fine, but she mouthed, *“Be careful,”* before cautiously closing the door.

Now, only Go Yeon-ju and I remained in the room. She had been silently listening to our conversation, and with a deep smile, she slid closer to me.

“Finally, just the two of us, huh?”

“Seems so. But could you stick to one form of address? You use informal speech with others but formal with me. It’s confusing.”

She giggled at my words, pressing herself closer with a flirtatious gesture. “Can’t help it. My personality flips back and forth. You think I act like this with just anyone? Men usually love it when I speak formally in private~”

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

“Don’t you feel the same? A <Ten Strongest> user acting coy and speaking formally right in front of you. Doesn’t it secretly thrill you?”

Her expression was less serious than before, but I instinctively felt the need to tread carefully. I gently pushed her away and adjusted my posture. She pouted playfully and glanced at the door.

“That bold girl from earlier was giving you some intense looks. Even I felt a bit touched watching her.”

“…You’re getting off track. Let’s get to the point.”

I could tell I’d get swept up in her pace if this continued, so I steered the conversation back. At my firm tone, she pursed her lips and spoke in a low voice. “Hmph. No fun. Fine, I’ll ask again. Why are you telling me all this?”

“I…” I paused, my gaze dropping to her chest, where a dagger was still deeply embedded in her cleavage.
