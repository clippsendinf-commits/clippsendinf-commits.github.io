# Chapter 40: Make an Offer

The day after entering the User Academy, the instructors fired the starting shot for grueling training. Within the first week, the Northern Continent’s User Academy proved its notorious reputation. Out of 130 trainees, over 10%—a staggering 17 users—dropped out, unable to endure the regimen. Notably, 15 of them were melee or ranged combat users.

To reiterate, the Northern Continent is under the jurisdiction of users from South Korea. One key distinction from other continents is its mandatory military service system. As a result, many adult male users, including reservists and those with military backgrounds, are not uncommon.

Perhaps because of this, the Northern Continent’s User Academy, the first of its kind across all continents, strongly reflected military culture. Beyond the harsh training, daily life—including meals, sleep, and basic activities—was tightly controlled, often stifling personal freedom.

Saying “the training is tough” would be an understatement, but sheer grit might allow one to persevere. What truly broke the new users, however, was the content of the training. The intensity made military boot camp exercises seem like child’s play. Most users who had proven their qualifications couldn’t stomach the training, with many vomiting on the first day and eventually giving up.

The highlight—or rather, the most infamous part—was the special training held only on weekends. The Hall Plane follows Earth’s calendar, and the weekend training on Saturdays and Sundays was the real reason so many new users fled the Academy. It also explained why most dropouts were combat users.

This training pitted users against each other in one-on-one combat.

Of course, mages and priests were exempt. Mages operate by drawing out and manifesting magical power, but beginners struggle to control it, and the breadth of knowledge they need to master is immense—13 weeks barely suffice to grasp the basics. Priests, similarly, focus on healing and support magic with little offensive capability, so they too were excluded.

If you think this combat training was polite sparring, you’re gravely mistaken. Users were handed sharp weapons and required to fight until they inflicted a certain level of injury on their opponent. While vital areas like the head and heart were protected with sturdy armor, other parts of the body were left exposed, forcing users to fight without restraint.

Naturally, precautions were in place. Renowned users served as instructors, ready to intervene in case of a fatal strike, and skilled priests stood by to heal injuries.

Even so, this mock combat training was far from ordinary. Most users called it insane, cursing its brutality. Yet, I held it in high regard. This training addressed the one concern I had for An-hyeon’s group during the Rite of Passage.

In the Hall Plane, no one knows when, where, or what might happen. Step far enough outside a city, and nowhere is safe. Traps, monster ambushes, or attacks by vagrants are constant threats. Even in areas under user influence, danger looms—let alone in uncharted regions.

Such situations demand split-second judgment and reflexes. Survival often hinges on how quickly one reacts. Hesitating to strike a human opponent or fumbling in confusion can lead to disaster. Thus, this training was critical, conditioning users to stab, be stabbed, and endure wounds as second nature.

My only concern was that I absolutely couldn’t afford to get injured in these mock battles. In other words, I had to win every fight. It was unlikely that novice users could breach my endurance, but I still felt some pressure.

Weak opponents were no challenge, but defeating stronger ones was trickier. For example, I once faced Woo Jeong-min. He focused entirely on defense, making the fight a stalemate, but I seized a momentary opening to land a counterattack and win.

This inevitably brought me some fame. It wasn’t much, given I was just a new user, but among instructors and peers, word spread that this batch of new users was strong, with Kim Su-hyeon standing out as particularly skilled and promising. Since this level of attention was acceptable, I didn’t mind.

There’s a saying, *nangjungjichu*: a person of great talent will naturally rise to prominence. Initially, old habits and paranoia made me think I had to hide my abilities completely.

“If you keep acting the same way, Oppa, you’ll end up repeating the same mistakes. And we might face the same situation again.”

“User Kim Su-hyeon, you cannot do anything alone.”

Han-byeol’s and Seraph’s words shook me to my core. I didn’t want to lose Yu-hyeon Hyung or Han So-yeong this time. I wanted to step into the light, help them openly, and see a happy ending together, not a tragic one.

In the Hall Plane, strength is measured by the number of trustworthy comrades you have. History and my own experience prove this. Even the unparalleled user with 101 Strength points fell to the combined might of an alliance. To gather such comrades, one needs both ability and reputation.

I realized my mindset had shifted from when I first arrived. I was ready to act when necessary. From that moment, my behavior changed.

No matter how tough the training, I tackled it without complaint, with fervor. Even when instructors enforced strict control, I complied politely. My excellent performance earned me favor among the instructors. (As a side note, the instructor assigned to my lodging became my errand-runner in no time.)

As word of User Kim Su-hyeon spread, my relationships with other users improved. More and more wanted to befriend me or build good ties. Instead of leaping forward recklessly, I climbed steadily, showing potential for growth. In other words, I advertised myself as someone with promise.

Humans adapt to their environment. The time it takes varies, but adaptation is significant. The survival rate of adapted users far surpasses those who can’t adjust.

In weeks two, three, and four, dropouts continued, but by weeks five, six, and seven, the numbers dwindled. By week eight, not a single user quit. Those who remained were the cream of the crop.

Of course, staying doesn’t guarantee survival, nor does leaving mean certain death. The Hall Plane is too unpredictable to judge life and death solely by the Academy. It’s a matter of probability.

Clans often list graduating from the User Academy as a condition for recruitment. I’ve even heard that some clans on other continents give bonus points to Northern Continent Academy graduates.

Those who dropped out will likely regret missing the four ability points awarded upon graduation if they survive the next two years.

An-hyeon’s group overcame my initial worries admirably. Not one, including Sol-i, dropped out, thanks in part to their experience enduring the forced march after leaving the city in the Rite of Passage.

Contrary to my expectation that An-hyeon would choose a sword and become a Swordsman, he picked a spear and became a Lancer. His high physical stats made any weapon viable, but I felt a twinge of regret. When Sol-i was in danger in the clearing, he threw a sword to sever a Deadman’s arm, showing great potential as a swordsman. I could have guided him toward Sword Master if he’d chosen that path, but he found the spear more interesting, so I let it be.

Curious, I asked why he chose Lancer. His answer was amusing.

“When I thought you were dead, Hyung, I lost it. Those guys pissed me off. They kept dodging my questions about whether you were alive and pushed me to set up my user profile or whatever. They told me to be a Swordsman, but I told them to get lost. In a fit of anger, I said I’d wield a spear.”

Sol-i, listening nearby, added that An-hyeon initially insisted on being a mage, startling the angel. She giggled, saying it was the first time she’d seen an angel flustered. I sighed inwardly at their casual banter.

Sol-i met my expectations by choosing Priest. According to An-hyeon, while it took him a long time to select his class, Sol-i chose hers in half that time. She disliked wielding weapons or harming others, making Priest a perfect fit.

Yu-jeong chose dual daggers, specifically two-handed ones, and proudly declared herself a Mercenary. Her balanced stats meant she’d excel in any melee class. I might have recommended Assassin, but Mercenary, with its versatility, was a solid choice.

As new users gained access to their stats, it became common at the Academy to ask about each other’s abilities. I gathered my group and strictly instructed them not to share their stats or abilities with anyone, including instructors—especially Sol-i, whom I warned repeatedly. She just smiled cluelessly, not understanding why.

I noticed a subtle shift in how the group treated me after the boss monster encounter. An-hyeon, Sol-i, and Yu-jeong subtly showed pride in my growing reputation, as if my achievements were their own, indicating they no longer saw me as an outsider. Han-byeol, however, was an exception.

She began distancing herself from us. When I asked what class she chose during our first training meetup, she replied coldly, “Didn’t you just tell us not to share our information with others?”

I meant detailed stats, not classes, which are inevitably revealed. I gave an awkward smile, but her words stung. Sensing my discomfort, she later mumbled that she’d chosen a mage class. I nodded, not activating my Third Eye to check, as I could guess her talent lay in magic.

Han-byeol often skipped our group meetings. Mages have a heavy study load, but so do other classes. We only met once a week for an hour or two, yet she frequently claimed, through Sol-i, that she was too busy.

“Don’t bother with her, Oppa,” Yu-jeong said. “She doesn’t share a room with Sol-i or me, and she barely talks. Let her do whatever. Honestly, I never liked Kim Han-byeol from the start.”

“That’s a bit harsh. Still…”

“Harsh? I heard she was seen talking to that guy—the one who explained things at the inn. Sounds like a traitor.”

I gave a bitter smile as Yu-jeong called Han-byeol a traitor. My initial bad feeling seemed to be coming true. Receiving an offer from the Golden Lion Clan wasn’t something to condemn—by week eight, I’d secretly received offers from over five clans, including them.

Still, her distancing behavior bothered me. She rarely spoke during the few meetings she attended, except once when she asked what I planned to do after graduation. I brushed it off, saying I was still thinking about it.

After that, I began separating Han So-yeong from Kim Han-byeol in my mind. I decided not to dwell on her anymore. I’d welcome her if she stayed, but I wouldn’t chase her if she left. I’d let those who leave go and carefully vet those who join. I aimed for a small, elite group, not a large, unwieldy one.

There’s a concept called *inyeon*—fate or connection between people. I believe *inyeon* isn’t just chance; it’s something you can forge. I’ve seen the power of bonds formed through *inyeon*. I decided to treat Han-byeol as a matter of *inyeon*. If our paths aligned, we’d meet again; if not, I’d let her go. I had the ability to form new connections, and clinging to an uncertain one was foolish.

Once I shed Han So-yeong’s shadow, I saw things more rationally. Coldly speaking, banking on Han-byeol’s potential was less worthwhile than securing users already proven in my first cycle. There were surely other new users with similar potential out there.
