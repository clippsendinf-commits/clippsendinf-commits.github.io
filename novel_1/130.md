# Chapter 129: Temporary Alliance

“Cough! Cough! Ack, cough… Unni, I’m so sorry…”
“…”

The water An-sol spat out had splashed onto Yu-jeong’s face. Yu-jeong, eyes closed, fumbled around the table with her hand. Ha-yeon rummaged through her pocket for a moment before subtly offering a clean piece of cloth. Yu-jeong cracked open her eyes, stared at the cloth briefly, then snatched it with enough force to make a sound.

Carefully wiping her face, Yu-jeong spoke up.  
“Sol, you and I need to have a little chat later.”  
“Hic… I didn’t mean to…”  

At Yu-jeong’s sharp tone, An-sol immediately bowed her head. But only for a moment. Soon, she began stealing glances at Go Yeon-ju. Perhaps finding An-sol’s sneaky looks endearing, a faint smile curved Go Yeon-ju’s lips. Sensing her amusement, An-sol flinched and averted her gaze. Go Yeon-ju’s smile deepened, growing richer and more pronounced.

“Little one, do you know who I am?”  

At Go Yeon-ju’s question, An-sol nodded slightly instead of answering, seemingly hesitant to speak. But Vivian, sitting beside her, poked An-sol’s side with a sullen expression. An-sol jumped with a yelp.  

“An-sol, what’s the deal with this Shadow Queen thing?”  
“I-I’ll tell you! Just stop poking me…”  

Vivian’s tone was curt, and An-sol pleaded in a teary voice. Vivian’s lower lip jutted out, likely still stewing over something I’d said earlier.  

I hadn’t meant to dismiss Vivian. The gap in strength between her and Go Yeon-ju was undeniable. Vivian, with her Rare Class and solid stats, was impressive, but Go Yeon-ju held a Secret Class with even better stats. Moreover, Go Yeon-ju had a clear advantage in compatibility. Based on my experience facing her in the first cycle, even in peak condition, the Shadow Queen had over a 70% chance of defeating the Chimera Alchemist. In an unprepared combat scenario, Vivian’s odds would plummet further.

After rubbing her side for a while, An-sol cautiously spoke up under Vivian’s persistent prodding.  
“Well… at the User Academy…”  
“Huh? They didn’t teach me anything like that.”  

Yu-jeong cut in sharply, but An-sol shook her head and continued.  
“N-no, probably not. When you look at the gender ratio, there are slightly more female users among priests due to the job’s nature… During a theory lecture, the instructor mentioned something in passing, and I remember hearing it.”  
“Oh? What did you hear? Tell me more, I’m curious.”  

Go Yeon-ju leaned in with an intrigued expression, but her eyes glinted like a hawk eyeing prey. Poor An-sol, unaware she might become the prey, hesitated before answering.  
“They mentioned a few famous female users in the Hall Plane… The Clan Lord of Istantel Rowe, the ‘Field Maestro.’ The ‘Princess of Execution’ from the same clan. And the mysterious free user, the ‘Shadow Queen,’ among others…”  
“Hmm…”  

The moment the words “Princess of Execution” were uttered, a chilling killing intent flickered in Go Yeon-ju’s eyes. It was fleeting, but I caught it. There seemed to be a longstanding grudge between her and the Princess of Execution. Curiosity stirred about what had happened between them, but since I couldn’t know now, I tucked the thought away for later.  

Noticing my gaze, Go Yeon-ju quickly smoothed her expression and flashed a soft smile.  
“So, I’m that rumored Secret Class, the Shadow Queen. My name’s Go Yeon-ju. Twenty-six years old. No boyfriend. For the record, if he’s a decent guy, I wouldn’t mind a married man with a string of kids.”  

She finished her introduction swiftly and shot me a sidelong glance. I, mid-bite of stew, froze at the unexpected jab. I hadn’t anticipated her retaliating like this. This time, there was no escaping the group’s notice. The sharper ones likely caught the implication in her words.  

Just then—  
*Clink.*  

Ha-yeon, who had been quietly listening, took a sip of water and set her cup down on the table with a noticeable thud. A bit of water splashed around. It wasn’t overly forceful, but for someone as composed as Ha-yeon, it was unusual.  

With a faint smile, she spoke.  
“I heard your introduction. Shall we introduce ourselves as well?”  
“Sounds good. We can’t just sit here quietly, can we?”  

Yu-jeong, wiping her mouth with the cloth, chimed in to support Ha-yeon. It was a rare moment of conversation between them, though not exactly a full exchange—more like Yu-jeong piggybacking on Ha-yeon’s words. Still, it hinted at the possibility of mending their strained relationship.  

But I couldn’t quite grasp what Yu-jeong meant by “we can’t just sit here quietly.” Go Yeon-ju, however, responded with a relaxed smile and a slight nod, as if daring them to try. Their gazes seemed to spark with a fierce intensity.  

One by one, the group began introducing themselves. Go Yeon-ju’s reactions varied distinctly with each person, particularly in how she addressed them.  

She called An-hyeon “Sir,” An-sol “Little One,” and Yu-jeong “Kiddo.” Surprisingly, Yu-jeong didn’t protest the nickname, though she shot a fierce glare upon hearing it—likely her strongest act of defiance in the moment.  

Her demeanor could come off as arrogant, but no one openly challenged her. The reputation of the Shadow Queen gave her the clout to act this way without question.  

After the others finished, it was Vivian’s turn. In an unusually cold tone, she introduced herself.  
“Vivian la Clarté. Mage-type Rare Class. Twenty-four years old.”  

When Vivian finished, Go Yeon-ju’s eyes lingered on her. The fact that Vivian was an ancient resident, not a user, seemed to pique her interest. They locked eyes briefly before turning away simultaneously.  

Finally, Go Yeon-ju turned to me, addressing me as “You.” The group’s expressions shifted subtly at that.  
“You’re Kim Su-hyeon, right? A Secret Class, you said?”  
“Kim Su-hyeon. Sword-user Secret Class. Twenty-four years old. But you already knew that.”  
“No, there’s one thing I don’t know. You mentioned Secret Class, but what’s the class name?”  

I snorted at her sly question. While starting a clan would inevitably reveal some details, there was no need to share everything with her now. Especially since, in rare cases, someone might deduce a Secret Class’s abilities from its name. I intended to be cautious unless absolutely necessary.  

When I stayed silent, Go Yeon-ju pressed again.  
“Come on, just spill it! You know all about me. Doesn’t that seem unfair?”  
“Nope. Doesn’t feel unfair at all. The Shadow Queen’s been active long enough to be well-known. We’re not. And you probably have a good guess already.”  
“I don’t. So tell me.”  
“No way.”  

At my firm refusal, Go Yeon-ju pouted and glanced at the others. Their faces looked forlorn, as if something precious had been taken from them. Honestly, it was all fine except for Ha-yeon’s crestfallen expression, which was hard to bear. I sighed inwardly.  

“Hmph. Fine, don’t tell me. I’ll be sticking close from now on—plenty of chances to find out.”  

Her emphasis on “sticking close” gave me pause, but I responded quickly.  
“Do whatever you want.”  
“Heh. Who says I need to get it directly from you?”  

As she spoke with a suggestive tone, I stiffened and looked up. Staring straight at her, I saw her flinch and whistle innocently.  

I gazed at her steadily before speaking in a calm voice.  
“Just so we’re clear—if I catch even a hint of you using Lure Eyes on the kids or anyone in the group, things will get very unpleasant.”  
“Oh, come on, that’s a bit oversensitive. It’s not even that harmful…”  
“Lure Eyes is a form of mental contamination, a type of mystic eye. Once it takes hold, it opens the door for other curses to slip in. If you so much as touch a hair on their heads, I’ll consider our deal null and void.”  

My warning shifted the group’s mood again. Moments ago, they’d been bristling at Go Yeon-ju’s blatant flirtation, but now they straightened up proudly as I stood up for them. Facing a member of the Ten Strong, our caravan’s leader holding his ground seemed to give them a sense of vicarious satisfaction.  

Yu-jeong and An-sol, who had been anxiously glancing between me and Go Yeon-ju, now nodded with relieved expressions. Amidst it, I heard someone mutter, “That’s my dad!” (At the same time, Go Yeon-ju let out a stifled laugh.) I swore to myself I’d find the culprit and give them a good scolding.  

“Tch. Talk about unfair,” Go Yeon-ju said with a mock-wounded tone. But a sly smile played on her lips, and she didn’t seem too bothered.  

It suddenly struck me that she might have orchestrated this situation on purpose. In a way, she was the new stone rolling into our group, and she seemed to be using me to subtly reassure the established members.  

If my hunch was right, Go Yeon-ju was laying the groundwork to blend into our group with the seasoned finesse of a veteran user. Of course, this was all contingent on my theory being correct.  

After that, Go Yeon-ju and I hashed out some finer details. When I mentioned that the reorganization would take at least two weeks, possibly up to four, she let out an incredulous laugh. Essentially, I was asking her to close her inn for nearly a month and a half.  

But it seemed Go Yeon-ju had little attachment to running the inn. She’d closed it without hesitation the moment I brought it up the previous night, and as expected, she didn’t protest my request.  

To my surprise, she extended an unexpected kindness—not just to me, but to the entire group. She seemed to have taken a liking to us and offered the use of her inn freely, an incredibly generous condition.  

The Modest Lady inn was by no means small. In fact, with access to the first, second, and third floors, it could solve our long-standing issue of finding a proper training space. I welcomed her offer enthusiastically. The first-floor lobby alone, once the tables were cleared, could serve as an excellent training ground.  

With such a magnanimous gesture, the group could no longer object to her joining, and the underlying tension noticeably dissipated. Impressed by her calculated approach, I decided to make one more request.  

It might seem shameless, but we might never see this user again after two months. Ideally, I’d recruit her, but if that wasn’t possible, she was someone I’d have to eliminate eventually. So, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to get as much out of her as I could now. Of course, this was a request, not a demand.  

“The reorganization period won’t be short. You might get a bit bored.”  
“Hmm?”  
“To be blunt, would you consider teaching one of the kids? I’m not asking for much—just the basics of dagger techniques.”  
“I’m expensive, you know. Secret Class and all. Pay me a fitting fee.”  
“I’ll pay based on the student’s progress later.”  

Go Yeon-ju burst into laughter at my words. An-hyeon, hearing this, fidgeted anxiously, clearly eager. But I had no intention of pairing him with her—he seemed the most susceptible to her charms. I quickly continued.  

“Honestly, it’s rare to meet a user as skilled with daggers as you. But if you’re not up for it, no worries. It’s just a request.”  

At my gentle tone, Go Yeon-ju’s eyes flicked to Yu-jeong. After studying her for a moment, she tossed out a casual remark.  
“Well, I won’t be bored for a while, at least.”
