# Memorize - Chapter 100: Su-hyeon’s Madness

Thanks to An-sol’s unintentional antics, the group’s mood lightened considerably. The person in question had flushed cheeks and teary eyes, but what could we do? It was genuinely amusing. Feeling a bit refreshed, the group was able to rest more comfortably. I wanted to rest too, but with An-sol tearfully rushing into my arms, that plan fell apart.

Leaving the fallen Wraith Knight behind, we resumed our exploration.

The other areas on the second floor were a paradise for the undead. Every time we opened a door, undead experiments from the laboratory lunged out, and each time, Vivian’s eyes blazed fiercely. Honestly, I couldn’t quite understand why she was so angry when her own actions weren’t much different from those of the laboratory’s researchers.

Moving clockwise, we reached the northern gate second. When we opened it, we found an empty space with nothing inside. I had hoped the northern gate would lead to stairs to the third floor, but my expectations were off. Since we had already rested enough in the room with the Wraith Knight while soothing a whimpering An-sol, we headed straight for the final eastern gate on the second floor.

Upon opening the eastern gate, we were greeted by none other than a Mummy.

The Mummy itself wasn’t particularly tricky, but it had a regeneration ability. Each time An-hyeon and Yu-jeong slashed at it, the bandages they cut would immediately regenerate, relentlessly threatening them. The bandages I cut didn’t seem to regenerate, but new ones soon emerged from within, putting us in a tough spot.

In the end, there was only one solution. I raised my left hand, adorned with a ring.

“Anti Magic.”

A white light surged from the ring on my left hand, and seizing the moment, Jeong Ha-yeon cast her specialty: an applied spell.

“Target: Monster Mummy. Overlap.”

The white light from my hand enveloped the bandages wrapping the Mummy. The bandages, bathed in white light, began to fade rapidly.

It seemed Jeong Ha-yeon hadn’t learned high-level spells like Dispel, but given the right situation, her applied spells could compensate for that. Yu-jeong’s dagger sliced through the Mummy’s bandages, and a piercing scream echoed. Not to be outdone, An-hyeon thrust his spear deep into the Mummy’s abdomen, while I swiftly slashed its neck with my sword. The Mummy let out one final horrific scream before collapsing.

As the others cheered and moved closer, I quickly grabbed them by the scruff of their necks and pulled them back, far from the fallen Mummy.

*Boom!*

The group struggled briefly but fell silent as the Mummy’s corpse exploded, releasing a foul stench. Some of them shivered, realizing they would have been drenched in toxic liquid had they approached. After confirming the Mummy had turned into tattered rags, I gently released the others.

“Good work. Jeong Ha-yeon, your magical application was impressive.”

“Compared to the close-combat warriors risking their lives up front, it’s just a small trick. Don’t flatter me too much.”

Jeong Ha-yeon responded humbly, but a faint smile suggested she wasn’t entirely displeased. Nearby, Vivian and An-sol, with her still-puffy eyes, were pouting. However, having witnessed Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong’s skills firsthand, they said nothing. Since the two mages joined our caravan, especially after the second floor, Jeong Ha-yeon’s contributions rivaled Vivian’s.

Inside the eastern gate’s room, we found stairs leading to the third floor. As I stared at the stairs, Shin Sang-yong approached me.

“Leader, are we heading to the third floor now?”

“We should. How’s everyone holding up?”

Turning my head to ask, the group each showed their readiness with distinctive gestures. However, An-hyeon kept glancing back with a hint of disappointment.

“An-hyeon.”

“Oh, yes, hyung. I’m fine.”

He flinched and nodded when I called him. Guessing what he was hoping for, I shook my head.

“Don’t be too upset if we didn’t find any items on the second floor. What we’ve already obtained is more than a jackpot.”

“Yeah… but, hyung, couldn’t I use the items that skeleton knight had?”

“No, it’s better to leave them.”

I was about to say, “Hmm, should we grab them?” but Vivian beat me to it. As An-hyeon’s gaze turned to her, she shook her head, mimicking me.

“Those items, used by something barely even undead… they’re likely to harm regular humans if used. Weapons meant to protect the user could end up threatening your life instead.”

“Hmm. Master, couldn’t purification solve that?”

“Idiot. Items with dark attributes—do you think they’d withstand purification? They’re already worn out and don’t look durable.”

“Oh, I see. As expected from Master!”

Her explanation wasn’t entirely baseless, so I nodded in agreement. Despite her clear reasoning, An-hyeon still seemed reluctant to let go, but seeing my approval, he sighed.

“We still have the third floor. Everyone, stay sharp. Let’s head up.”

Vowing to gift An-hyeon something if he became a Ki-Gong Spearmaster, I started up the stairs to the third floor. The group quietly followed, climbing the steps one by one.

---

Opening the third floor’s door revealed a single space. Despite the passage of time, it seemed to preserve the tragedy of the past, holding onto a horrific scene. If I had to describe it, it was a pile of ashes—literally a space reduced to ashes.

Had a small war been fought here? The scattered fragments and rusted debris left the group speechless.

But my silence had a different reason.

The third floor was steeped in eerie stillness, but a rustling sound broke it as a figure rose. At the same time, the chair it had been sitting on crumbled with a *crack*.

“Well, well, humans after so long…”

The figure slowly turned to face us. Its skin had a dark blue hue, horns protruded from its forehead, and demonic wings fluttered behind it. It was a Demonic Being.

The group flinched at the sight. They likely hadn’t expected to encounter a Demonic Being so soon. Neither had I. I knew we’d face one eventually, but I never imagined it would be *him* here.

“No words from humans I haven’t seen in ages. How dull.”

It was him, no doubt. That arrogant face, those condescending eyes, and the habit of ending sentences with “how dull.” How desperately I’d wanted to meet him again. The things I wanted to do, the words I wanted to say—they surged within me, awakening desires I’d buried deep in my heart as I returned. They crept through my entire being.

I rubbed my eyes and stared at him again. This was real. Part of me wanted to pinch my cheek to confirm it. Gripping my sword, I felt my chest swell. The weighty handle felt unusually satisfying today.

“Why so silent? Say something. It’s been a while since I’ve seen humans…”

“Su, Su-hyeon-ssi.”

“Hyung.”

My heart pounded fiercely. The blood coursing through my veins surged, burning hot. I felt the old me, lost while living with the others, returning. In a seething voice, I spoke.

“Nice… *chuckle*… to meet you.”

“Hmph. An ill-mannered human. I told you to speak, but shouldn’t you kneel and show respect first, you lowly thing?”

Madman.

“I am Belphegor, a proud Demonic Being holding the rank of Count in the Demon World. I say again—kneel.”

“Oh, shut up. A Count, huh? That’s a pain.”

Vivian muttered, frowning. Belphegor, the Demon of Sloth. He could be classified as an upper-tier demon. Not quite top-tier, but with the potential to become one, his power was considerable in its own right.

“Understand? Watch your words and actions from now on. Hmph… even as the Demon of Sloth, being trapped here for ages without going anywhere was unbearable. Since it’s been a while, I’ll show mercy just this once.”

At his words, the group’s expressions grew uneasy.

I despise Demonic Beings. More arrogant, more cunning, and more untrustworthy than anyone. They’d stop at nothing to fulfill their desires—vermin. Yet their schemes and power were formidable. Because of their vile tricks, I lost someone precious to me. And Belphegor…

“Stop your nonsense. I’ll kill you, you lunatic.”

He was the one who sparked *that incident*. Seeing Belphegor here, one of the mysteries I’d carried unraveled. His presence in the Ruined Laboratory was surprising enough, and I still didn’t know how he got here. But I began to understand how one of the events from my first cycle came to be.

Recalling that moment, rage surged again. I sneered, raising my sword. I felt several gazes turn toward me at my intense reaction, but I didn’t care. Right now, my priority was to crush the creature before me as brutally as possible.

Even with strength surpassing my first cycle, victory wasn’t guaranteed. He was, after all, an upper-tier demon. But I wasn’t afraid. If anything, I felt exhilaration.

Belphegor looked at me with an intrigued smile before speaking in a polite tone.

“Humans are amusing. Heh. I’ve decided—you’ll be my chair.”

“That’s your last word, huh?”

“Human, even for vermin like you, this is irritating. I’ve humored your antics enough. But I can be merciful. If you apologize now, I’ll let you and one other male human die cleanly. Of course, you’ll serve as my chair for life.”

“Oh? And the female humans?”

I smirked, and Belphegor responded with a matter-of-fact expression.

“Isn’t it obvious? They’ll serve this great me. The wretched humans here once pulled some pathetic stunt, trapping me in this building. It’s been boring, but now some fine female humans have arrived. They look top-notch—very satisfactory.”

His words visibly twisted the faces of the group, especially the female Users. After glancing at them, I spoke in a mocking tone.

“They don’t seem eager to serve you.”

“They’re just ignorant. Don’t worry. My ‘tool’ is thick and long enough to satisfy them. Female humans should consider it an honor to serve Belphegor, the great Count of the Demon World.”

“Lunatic.”

“I told you to watch your mouth. Don’t like the role of a chair? Kneel and beg now, and I might reconsider.”

“No need to hear more. Everyone, prepare for battle.”

At my command, the group drew their weapons. Belphegor looked down at us with boundless arrogance before speaking in a bored tone.

“Humans always shut up after a show of force… how dull.”

As he finished, dark blue flames erupted before him—Dark Fire, one of the flames Demonic Beings wield. Naturally, it was several levels below Hwa-jeong. Still, it was formidable in its own right.

“When I was first summoned here, it was fine. But the offerings were lacking. They presented half-baked, worthless things…”

“So you weren’t fully summoned. Perfect. That’ll make crushing you easier.”

At my words, Belphegor’s eyes glinted.

“Heh heh. You’re right, human. The power I have here is less than seventy percent of my true strength… You seem to know something. But.”

He paused, snapping his fingers with a *click*. The dark flames surged toward me. With a leisurely smile, he continued.

“You’re too irritating. No more leniency, human. Burn to ashes before the great Demonic Being’s flames. Writhe in agony! Hahaha!”

Amid his maniacal laughter, I slowly awakened Hwa-jeong’s power as the flames hurtled toward me. A searing heat rose within me, and I raised my sword overhead.

Seeing this, a thick smile spread across Belphegor’s face.
