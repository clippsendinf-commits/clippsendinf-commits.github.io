# Chapter 9: Kim Su-hyeon Begins the Rite of Passage

“Ugh… I can’t stand this stifling atmosphere anymore!”

“Eek!”

Park Dong-geol, who had been scanning the surroundings, seized the moment to raise his voice and step into the center of the clearing. Startled by his sudden outburst, Lee Shin-u let out a sharp, hoarse yelp. In that fleeting moment, I caught Park Dong-geol flashing a satisfied smirk at Lee Shin-u. It was, in polite terms, an attempt to assert dominance—or, more crudely, to show off.

“Hey! Don’t you guys know *anything* about this damn situation? Huh?”

An-sol was trembling, buried in An-hyeon’s arms. The two women I hadn’t yet identified wore contrasting expressions. One maintained a relatively calm demeanor, while the other clearly disapproved of Park Dong-geol’s commotion, her eyes narrowing as she glared at him. Curiosity tugged at me to check their user information, but I decided to focus on the man’s antics for now.

“Is everyone here mute? Stop clamming up and say something, anything!”

‘He’s acting tough.’

Was he trying to flaunt his temper or prove his masculinity? Park Dong-geol’s aggressive gestures culminated in him kicking a fist-sized rock with force. The rock sailed through the air with surprising speed, vanishing into the forest. His impulsive action cast an awkward silence over the seated group. But I noticed something: there was no sound of the rock hitting the ground.

*Growl.*

A low, guttural sound echoed through the quiet forest. Though the rock’s landing was silent, everyone clearly heard the growl. A flicker of unease crossed their faces. I couldn’t recall every detail from ten years ago, but faint memories began to resurface, stirring in my mind.

I remembered what had happened in this place back then.

“Damn it! Who’s got a problem? Step up if you do. You? Or you?”

Park Dong-geol targeted those who seemed weaker, like a coward picking easy prey. Lee Bo-rim and Lee Shin-u, pale with fear, shook their heads frantically. Then, the woman who had been glaring at him stood up, her breathing heavy with pent-up frustration.

“Sir, can you stop? You’re acting like a child despite your age!”

“What? *Stop*? *My age*? You talking to *me* like that?”

“Yeah, I am. What’re you gonna do about it? Aren’t you embarrassed? We’re all in the same mess here, so why are you bullying them?”

“Now you’re dropping honorifics? What kind of upbringing did you have to talk back to an adult like that? Did your parents teach you to be so rude?”

“Rude? Oh, please. So your parents taught you to pick on kids half your age, you piece of trash?”

I couldn’t help but chuckle inwardly at the woman’s sharp retort, refusing to back down. Park Dong-geol let out a hollow laugh, stunned, but his face soon flushed red with rising anger. With a sharp huff, he stomped toward her, his expression menacing.

“Hey, you little brat. What did you say about my parents? Say it again.”

Most people would’ve flinched under the intimidation of an angry adult man, but whether she was fearless or just stubborn, the woman didn’t budge. She met his gaze head-on and scoffed.

“Funny. You think I’m scared of you? I said, did your mom and dad teach you to act like this, you bastard?”

“You little—You’re asking to die!”

Genuinely enraged, Park Dong-geol’s fist slowly rose into the air. Yet the woman didn’t even blink. Just as he poised to swing, a voice cut through.

“Hey, sir. That’s enough.”

An-hyeon, who had been silent until now, finally spoke. Park Dong-geol, mid-swing, turned to him with a dumbfounded expression. I saw An-sol tugging at An-hyeon’s sleeve, but he pressed on.

“She’s not wrong. We’re all in the same situation here. Why are you picking on them? What did they do?”

“You… you little punks…”

Humiliation crept into Park Dong-geol’s expression as he bit his lip. Feeling the weight of everyone’s stares, he slowly lowered his fist. The woman gave a faint, mocking smirk, and Park Dong-geol let out a furious roar before turning away. He plopped back down, muttering curses, clearly fuming that things hadn’t gone his way.

“Damn it, what’re you staring at? Look away!”

Unable to contain his frustration, he lashed out at Lee Shin-u, who was sitting quietly nearby. Lee Shin-u, with an aggrieved look, shifted to another spot. Then it came again.

*Growl.*

The same growl we’d heard before rang clearly in our ears. And with that, I could finally piece together the vague memory.

Back then, we’d wasted time like this, bickering, only to be scattered by a sudden attack. The cause? Park Dong-geol’s kicked rock and the shouting match with the woman.

That was all I remembered about these people. I didn’t know what happened to them afterward, but since I never saw them again in the Hall Plane…

‘Did they all die in the Rite of Passage? Well, maybe not An-sol.’

If we kept wasting time like this, we’d likely repeat the same mistakes from my first cycle. No, we *would* repeat them.

I decided to offer a little help—not direct intervention, but just enough to nudge them into action and cooperation. I picked up my crossbow.

*Click!*

“What are you doing…?”

Everyone was on edge, their gazes snapping toward the small sound.

The woman who’d just held her own in the argument spoke to me. Despite her earlier fire, she addressed me politely, unlike her exchange with Park Dong-geol, who seemed to have thoroughly gotten on her nerves.

“It’s unsettling, isn’t it?”

“That crossbow’s making me more uneasy.”

“Well… where do you think we are right now?”

“Huh?”

Her eyes widened, sharp but framed by a pretty face.

“On my way here, I experienced things that defy explanation. Haven’t we all?”

“Well… yeah…”

People nodded slowly. The Summoning Room, the angel, the teleportation—they’d all seen and been through it. What they needed now was to accept this reality, even if it felt impossible, and approach the Rite of Passage with a mindset geared toward survival. I began loading an arrow into my crossbow. Though smaller than most, its detachable wrist-mounted design was quite convenient. Noticing the earlier growl and my actions, the others began picking up their own weapons, one by one.

Soon, everyone except those who’d arrived empty-handed was armed. Preparations were roughly complete. I surveyed the surroundings, sinking into thought.

We were in a clearing at the heart of the forest, surrounded by trees and dense foliage. I started moving in the opposite direction of where Park Dong-geol had kicked the rock.

After just a few steps from the clearing, the atmosphere grew noticeably darker. The trees and grass ahead seemed to carry a gloomy hue.

The growl had likely instilled some unease in them. I could sense people beginning to follow me, their presence growing as they moved. Just as I thought their initiative wasn’t bad, my plan hit a snag.

“Hey, An-sol. Get up. We need to follow that guy.”

“Nooo… I don’t want to go into the forest… It’s scary…”

“What, you’re just gonna stay here? You’ve been saying you’re uneasy, that something feels off. So why the sudden change?”

“Ugh…”

Hearing the siblings’ exchange, I felt my eyes narrow. With her 100-point Luck stat, An-sol might be sensing something instinctively. But it was just a hunch. She seemed unable to overcome her fear, refusing to budge from the ground.

*Growl! Growl!*

As they bickered, more growls echoed, growing louder and closer. The others, initially patient, began showing signs of restlessness.

“Um, can we just go ahead? I’ve been feeling jittery for a while now…”

“Yeah, let’s go! Just leave them behind. What’s with these noises all of a sudden…?”

Lee Shin-u’s voice carried a grim determination, and Park Dong-geol quickly agreed.

Whether she overheard or sensed their urgency, An-hyeon’s expression grew more desperate as he tugged at An-sol.

“Come on, get up. I’m right here with you. Please, just listen.”

“B-but… my legs won’t move… Waaah…”

An-sol burst into tears. Meanwhile, Lee Shin-u and Park Dong-geol kept shooting glances, clearly eager to escape this unnerving place. I had no intention of abandoning the siblings. In fact, sticking with them would be far more advantageous than staying with the others.

“Let’s just go already! Why are we standing around?”

“Come on, hurry up…”

As the group’s murmurs grew, An-hyeon’s face hardened. He forcefully shook off An-sol’s grip on his sleeve. Startled, she looked up, her lips trembling.

“O-oppa?”

“Fine. Stay here alone then. I’m leaving.”

He was bluffing, but it was a decent act. An-hyeon grabbed his sword and shield, turning away sharply. As he strode toward us, An-sol, shocked, stammered apologies. Hearing him say, “Sorry for the delay. Let’s go,” she began to sob openly. Ignoring her, An-hyeon urged us forward, pretending to lead the way into the forest.

“Waaah… Oppa… Don’t go…”

“An-sol, get up *now*. Get a grip, please.”

“I’m sorry… Don’t leave me again… Don’t go… Waaah…”

“Get up *right now*!”

An-hyeon finally raised his voice, glaring. It seemed to work, as An-sol, still crying, slowly began to stand. But then—

*Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!*

‘Damn, we took too long.’

Frustration hit me—not from fear, but from the possibility that the future might shift and I could lose An-sol here. The growls were now unmistakably close, their source nearly upon us. An-sol, just starting to rise, froze in place.

“O-oppa…”

The distance between them widened. Despite An-sol’s outstretched hand, An-hyeon remained resolute—or at least pretended to be. The sharp-tongued woman, unable to watch any longer, stepped forward, but An-hyeon raised a hand to stop her.

“Just leave her.”

“Oppa! Don’t leave me!”

“Then come to us yourself. It’s not too late. If you can’t even do that, you won’t survive.”

“Waaah…”

For a moment, An-hyeon struck me as resolute. His eyes held a firm conviction as he stared at An-sol. It seemed to reach her, as she gritted her teeth, looking ready to move. But it was too late.

*Growl! Growl!*

‘Those growls… Deadmen.’

Deadmen. Despite their ominous name, they’re weak by Hall Plane standards—barely considered monsters. They possess some intelligence and can infect others, but the infection is treatable with prompt care. (Not that treatment’s an option here.)

Another trait of theirs…

*ROAR!*

Normally, they shamble slowly, but when they spot prey, they charge at a sprint.

A Deadman burst from the forest, its gaping maw aimed at An-sol. Caught off guard, An-hyeon screamed and rushed forward.

“Sol!”

The screams weren’t his alone.

“Argh!”

“Eek!”

It was like a scene from a zombie movie. The creature, its torn flesh dangling, sent the group into chaos. A rock was lodged in its exposed chest—undoubtedly the one Park Dong-geol had kicked. It must have been struck and started lurking nearby.

*Growl! Growl! Growl! Growl! Growl! Growl! Growl! Growl!*

The group’s screams triggered more growls from beyond the forest, their numbers growing.

“Aaaaah!”

“Sol! Snap out of it! Sol!”

An-sol, who had just managed to stand, seemed to lose all composure at the sight of the Deadman. An-hyeon dashed forward, but the creature was closer. Realizing this, he drew back his sword arm and swung with force.

*Swish! Thud!*

‘Oh? A hit?’

The sword sliced through the air, cleanly severing the Deadman’s left arm. But that was all. The creature staggered briefly, then regained its balance and reached An-sol.

“Noooo!”

The Deadman’s jaws gaped wide.

An-sol stood frozen, eyes wide.

An-hyeon wailed in despair.

In that moment, I knew my actions had altered An-sol’s future. Without hesitation, I fired the crossbow I’d been readying.

*Ping!*

The arrow whistled through the air, piercing the Deadman’s head with a clean *thud*. Its weak point was the head. If a kicked rock could pierce its chest, an arrow stood no chance of being stopped. The Deadman collapsed, still gaping.

*Thump!*

“Crazy…”

“Huff… huff…”

The group’s reactions were similar, clutching their weapons reflexively as they realized the gravity of the situation. They’d known it vaguely before, but now the atmosphere was unmistakably dire.

Amid the chaos, An-hyeon moved quickly. He rushed to An-sol, who was still trembling and stammering, and helped her up, hurrying back to the group. He was breathing heavily, clearly shaken by the encounter.

All eyes turned to me. I stepped forward. Killing one Deadman was a start, but more were coming—their growls were multiplying. If they formed a encirclement, we’d be in serious trouble.

Without a word, I began walking.
