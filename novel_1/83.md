# Chapter 82: New Face

Shin Sang-yong could truly be seen as a user with an introverted personality. It had been over five minutes, and he still hadn’t gotten to the point, circling around the main topic, which was starting to feel a bit frustrating. Although I was listening patiently because of the many eyes watching, the kids were beginning to show bored expressions.

“Sang-yong-ssi,” Jeong Ha-yeon said in a low voice, giving him a subtle nudge.

Noticing her tone, Shin Sang-yong let out an awkward laugh. He took a deep breath, his eyes gleaming as he spoke again.

“Have any of you ever heard of a magic square?”

A magic square. Of course, I’d heard of it. But I sensed that what Shin Sang-yong was about to discuss wasn’t just an ordinary magic square—it likely had something to do with his True Name. My curiosity piqued, I focused even more intently. At the same time, I activated my Third Eye. I was eager to know what kind of abilities could lead to such a True Name.

“I don’t know how far everyone has developed their abilities, but I’m a bit different from most users. The thing is… I don’t have a Special Ability. It’s not that I never had one, but rather, my original Special Ability evolved into a Unique Ability—a rare case.”

“That’s…” I stared at him with intrigued eyes.

He met my gaze calmly and continued in a clear, deliberate voice, unlike before. “I’m sorry for revealing this so openly. But, you see, while I might be decent at studying, I’m terrible at interpersonal relationships or social maneuvering. I’m no good at deceiving others or being deceived. And since I’m about to make a bold request of you, Su-hyeon-ssi, I at least wanted to disclose my user information.”

“…That’s still a bit overwhelming.”

“No need to feel burdened at all. I revealed it on my own accord.”

I sighed and nodded. Honestly, the reason for my intrigue wasn’t that he lacked a Special Ability or had a Unique Ability. Though rare even in my first cycle, I had seen a few users like that. What really sparked my curiosity was what kind of power this “Magic Square of Harmony” held.

At my signal, Shin Sang-yong raised both hands. Naturally, everyone’s attention turned to his hands—except for one person.

Jeong Ha-yeon had been staring at my face ever since Shin Sang-yong began speaking. She was likely making her own judgments internally. I sharpened my focus on the hands he raised.

“I’ll now show you my Unique Ability.”

*Whoosh! Crackle!*

As soon as he finished speaking, I could feel Shin Sang-yong generating a faint magical energy. Flames appeared in his right hand, while ice formed in his left—two opposing forces. Could the Magic Square of Harmony mean…?

Before I could finish the thought, Shin Sang-yong clapped his hands together. With my Third Eye activated, I was astonished to see countless magical calculations unfolding between his palms. I quickly composed my expression, but in that moment, I noticed Jeong Ha-yeon’s eyes deepen beside me.

Shin Sang-yong carefully enveloped a single energy that impossibly combined ice and fire—two theoretically incompatible forces. Gazing at it with affectionate eyes, he spoke in a quiet voice.

“Pretty, isn’t it…? This is my Unique Ability, called the Magic Square of Harmony. Haha.”

Soon after, the fire and ice dissipated within his hands. A few gasps echoed around us; the visual was undeniably beautiful. Though I wasn’t sure of its exact power, the destructive potential from combining opposing forces was likely immense.

I couldn’t help but feel a strong desire for the Magic Square of Harmony. If I could combine Hwa-jeong, the Essence of Fire, with an opposing force of similar magnitude using this ability… I briefly entertained the thought but shook my head. The Ancient Priestess’s Stigma already embedded in my body was superior in rank and efficiency to the Magic Square of Harmony. Even so, it could only barely contain Hwa-jeong. If Hwa-jeong’s energy were used in the Magic Square of Harmony, it would probably shatter instantly.

Shin Sang-yong scratched his head with a shy expression at the kids’ gasps, then spoke again in a calm voice.

“Calling myself an inventor might be a bit grandiose. Back in Korea, I worked at a research institute. I love calculations and have a great interest in creating things. My favorite field, in particular, was magic squares.”

A magic square: a grid of natural numbers arranged in a specific order, starting from 1, with no omissions or repetitions, where the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is equal.

“The principle of magic squares today pursues harmony and balance. You may not know this, but there are many real-world applications of magic squares.”

The kids’ faces were growing bored again. An-hyeon and Yu-jeong, in particular, were openly pouting. Those brats. I sent Shin Sang-yong an apologetic look, and he waved it off with a good-natured smile.

“After coming to the Hall Plane, I became a mage. I wanted to be a priest, but my assigned angel strongly recommended mage. Honestly, being a mage suited me well. But… I’m a bit different from other mages.”

That was true. With no Special Ability and such a remarkable Unique Ability, his Potential Abilities were disappointing. Orthodox Magic was a given, as it’s essential for mages. But Alchemy Magic and Ancient Language Deciphering, which are useless in combat—what was he thinking when he awakened those?

His stats were decent enough to have survived somehow, but it was a shame he hadn’t utilized his class’s strengths more effectively. Even a higher rank in Orthodox Magic would have been useful, but both his Alchemy and Orthodox Magic were below B-rank. Pretending to know nothing, I kept a neutral expression and waited for his next words.

“As a mage in the Hall Plane, learning Orthodox Magic is standard. But, perhaps due to my nature, I was deeply interested in Alchemy Magic. People around me tried to dissuade me from learning it, but my personal ambition drove me to pursue it anyway. Haha. Pretty foolish, right? Chasing ideals in a world where survival is at stake.”

Yes, that’s foolish. I wanted to say it but instead shook my head calmly.

“But I don’t regret it. Without Alchemy Magic these past two years, my weak self might have gone mad… Oh, I’ve talked too long. Let me finally explain why I came to you, Su-hyeon-ssi.”

Shin Sang-yong let out a deep “Hoo.”

“I learned about the Ancient Alchemist’s Dungeon by pure chance. I shared the information with the Jeong sisters, Ha-yeon and Ji-yeon, whom I knew well, and we secretly formed a caravan. The Golden Lion Clan currently discourages exploration, you see. So, in a way, I bear a lot of responsibility for what happened to Ji-yeon. If I hadn’t mentioned it… I still regret that.”

I see. They didn’t just blindly enter the Black Forest—they had some information. I nodded, and Jeong Ha-yeon, who had been listening quietly, responded in a soft voice.

“There’s moral responsibility, sure. But by that logic, I’m responsible too. So is Ji-yeon herself. She didn’t come along reluctantly—she decided it was feasible. So…”

Hearing her bittersweet tone, Shin Sang-yong gave an apologetic look. Sensing she didn’t want to dwell on Ji-yeon, he quickly turned his head.

“Though we failed to conquer the dungeon, I haven’t given up my curiosity about ancient alchemy. I know it’s foolish, but if it weren’t for your group, Su-hyeon-ssi, or if I’d survived, I might have gone back to that dungeon. But now, there’s no need. Because…”

Shin Sang-yong paused, glancing at Vivian, who sat beside me with a blank expression. He folded his legs and knelt, bowing deeply with both hands on the ground before I could stop him.

“I know it’s shameless to ask for dungeon rewards or items. I have no such intentions. But when I heard there’s a living resident alchemist, I couldn’t stay still. Please, I beg you, let me learn under her.”

“Sang-yong-ssi, please get up.”

“No. I know this request is already brazen. Alchemy isn’t mainstream in the Hall Plane—it’s treated as an outcast even among non-mainstream fields. There’s no one to advise me, no clear path. I’ve only been fumbling through self-study… I don’t even know if I’m on the right track. For the past six months, I’ve felt stuck, like I’m hitting a wall. If this continues…”

Shin Sang-yong kept his head down, and I could hear a slight tremble in his voice. A memory suddenly surfaced, and I closed my eyes.

I understood his feelings better than anyone. I, too, had never received guidance. I reached the rank of Sword Master through sheer self-study, and recalling that process still brought waves of frustration.

The feeling of facing an insurmountable wall, knowing you have to climb it but finding it too solid to break through—the despair is indescribable.

For most users, by their second year, their stats are largely developed. Unlike the early days when stats skyrocketed daily, now it takes immense effort to gain even a single point. Feeling almost entranced, I spoke calmly.

“I once read something in a book that left a deep impression on me, and I still carry it in my heart.”

Shin Sang-yong seemed determined not to rise until I responded, but I could tell he was listening intently. Seeing a second-year user kneel before a zeroth-year user, showing such dedication, warmed my heart. I continued in a softer tone.

“When you face that wall, you wonder how you’ll ever overcome it. And you must surmount it with your own strength. But once you do…”

I paused briefly for effect before continuing.

“That wall becomes a solid foundation beneath your feet.”

“Ah…”

Shin Sang-yong finally lifted his head, seemingly touched by my words. I spoke again. His request—I hadn’t heard the details yet, so I couldn’t judge rashly, but it was undoubtedly a good opportunity.

“I…”
