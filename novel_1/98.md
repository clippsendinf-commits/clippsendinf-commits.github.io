# Memorize - Chapter 97 (97/1068): Can You Keep Up?

The signal to begin was Shin Sang-yong extending his left hand.

“Magic Square of Harmony.”

Unlike the small-scale magic square he had shown before, this was the full-fledged Magic Square of Harmony. The moment Shin Sang-yong softly chanted, a three-dimensional magic circle materialized above his left palm. Soon, a distinctly visible magic square rose, far more pronounced than before, and Shin Sang-yong and Jeong Ha-yeon fired their respective spells into it.

The fire and ice spells reached the magic square simultaneously, swirling together like a whirlwind before being absorbed into the circle. From this point, it was up to Shin Sang-yong’s skill. The first step had to be executed perfectly to ease the burden on Jeong Ha-yeon and An-sol, who would take up the baton next.

“───. ───. ───.”

Shin Sang-yong, sweating profusely, never ceased his muttering. His piercing gaze fixed on the magic square suggested he was internally performing intricate adjustments and arrangements. It didn’t take long. Fortunately, his expression brightened rapidly, as if he had found the correct configuration in record time.

Moments later, the spell that emerged above the magic square took on an impossible form, lingering in the air.

The spell they had created was encased in jagged ice crystals protruding outward, with searing flames swirling around them. It was a strong start. With a slightly strained expression, Shin Sang-yong glanced at Jeong Ha-yeon, passing the maintained spell to her.

Receiving his gaze, Jeong Ha-yeon licked her lips as she watched the spell float toward her. It had been a long time since she attempted a spell combination that pushed her limits. The moment she took control of the spell, she felt an intense burden flood her body. It was manageable, though. After briefly observing the spell, she poured every ounce of her strength into casting her next spell.

“Reverse!”

The moment Jeong Ha-yeon’s clear voice rang out, the spell they had crafted was enveloped in white light once more. This time, she chose to reverse the mana’s designated position.

“Hngh…!”

Jeong Ha-yeon let out a soft moan. Using mana interference to maintain the spell rather than dispel it caused a dizzying sensation in her head. The backlash from the reversal sent a massive surge of mana flowing back into her. 

Yet, she endured and successfully completed the reversal with perfect precision. The spell, now infused with Reverse, resembled its original form but was distinctly different. The key change was that the flames, previously swirling outside, now danced within the jagged ice crystals.

Watching from the side, An-sol gasped in awe at the seamlessly integrated spell. But a trace of anxiety crept in as well—she would soon have to take over this spell.

It wasn’t over yet. While the spell was already formidable enough to be unleashed, their opponent was a giant, one of the epitomes of magic resistance. Their blood inherently repelled magic. To overcome this, they needed to craft an even more potent spell.

Holding her reeling mind together, Jeong Ha-yeon cast another spell.

“───. Target Lock… Shackles Spell. Overlap.”

The Overlap spell, in some ways, resembled the Magic Square of Harmony, being a form of advanced applied magic. However, it operated within the laws of magical affinity, unable to defy them as the Magic Square could. Still, it was undeniably one of the higher-tier applied spells.

The spell they had created flowed into the Shackles spell cast by An-sol. The moment the divine spell met the magic, a brilliant white light flashed, filling the surroundings. The process of multiple spells converging into one was nothing short of breathtaking.

Now, the baton passed to An-sol. Everything had gone smoothly so far, but if An-sol, the final caster, couldn’t handle the burden, it would all be for naught. As Jeong Ha-yeon glanced at her with a hint of concern, An-sol grimaced but seemed to hold her own. Her current Magic stat was 86, while Jeong Ha-yeon’s was 87. Of course, Jeong Ha-yeon didn’t know this precisely—if she did, she might have fainted from shock. For now, she was simply proud of An-sol’s resilience in such a critical moment.

An-sol slowly raised her staff. The overwhelming concentration of magical energy, something she was experiencing for the first time since entering the Hall Plane, was daunting, but it also signified the spell’s immense power. Yet, she hesitated.

*…Can I really hit the target? I need to hurry. What do I do…?*

An-sol could only confidently use three spells: Shackles, Healing, and Protection. She could manage Detoxification and a few others with some effort, but she hadn’t mastered a Homing spell. Regret gnawed at her, but it was useless now. Noticing her hesitation, Jeong Ha-yeon spoke in a sharp tone.

“It’s okay. Fire it.”

“N-no, don’t…”

“Fire it! If you keep holding it, the mana will backflow, and the spell will dissipate.”

Whether her words were the trigger or An-sol was intimidated by Jeong Ha-yeon’s cold tone, she swallowed hard. Raising her staff and aiming at the Gigas ahead, she hesitated for a moment longer before finally speaking in a trembling voice.

“Shackles…!”

Confirming An-sol’s spell launch, Jeong Ha-yeon prepared one final spell.

---

While slashing through the air, I landed lightly on the ground. Before me, a Gigas panted, its body marred with long, jagged sword wounds. It was undeniably strong. Compared to giants or basilisks individually, the Gigas held a clear advantage. It had put up a decent fight.

But that was all. It wasn’t a boss monster, just a crafted creature, so I was confident of victory from our first clash. I had intended to use this fight as a warm-up before facing the demon on the third floor, so I was somewhat pleased by its appearance. For warming up, big, durable opponents like this were perfect.

It was time to finish things. I prepared to leap again, though I wasn’t sure what the others were doing. Judging by the Gigas twisting its body now and then, they were faithfully following my orders. I had instructed Vivian to act as a keeper, and she was cleverly restraining only its right arm. That was more than enough for me.

“Time to end this.”

Muttering to myself, I began to channel my mana. Just as I raised my sword to cleave it from head to toe, a sound rang out.

*Paang!*

The sound of a spell being launched came from behind, and it hurtled toward me and the Gigas at terrifying speed. I paused, knees bent for a leap. I had sensed the mages chanting something, but the spell now flying toward me gave off a vibe I didn’t want to get hit by. I considered dodging or cutting it down, but as if reading my mind, the spell shifted its trajectory, heading straight for the Gigas’s left arm.

“A Target Lock spell, huh.”

Jeong Ha-yeon’s handiwork, no doubt. My slight provocation had worked perfectly. Smiling faintly, I decided to wait. It would be rude to finish it off before they completed their spell, and I was a bit curious.

The Gigas, which had charged at me with such ferocity, now looked pale after taking a thorough beating. I hated when monsters got cocky, so I had deliberately struck it with the flat of my blade instead of cutting it.

A brief lull settled in, and I could feel the others swiftly retreating. They were a mixed bag—sometimes impressive, sometimes not. If only they were this reliable outside of combat. The more we fought, the more An-hyeon and Yu-jeong showed their growth.

As I paused my onslaught, a fleeting look of relief crossed the Gigas’s face. But it was merely a momentary reprieve before death. After observing the spell, I planned to finish it off, channeling mana into my feet. I had to be careful not to jump too high and crash through the ceiling.

The Shackles spell, glowing with white light, passed by me and sped toward the Gigas’s left arm. The creature didn’t react, merely catching its breath.

It seemed to make a feeble attempt to dodge, but with Vivian firmly restraining its right arm, it resigned itself to taking the hit. Unaware that its magic resistance would be its downfall, the Gigas only panted heavily.

As the spell grazed past me and soared upward, I caught a glimpse of it and was momentarily stunned. It was clearly a spell crafted through Shin Sang-yong’s Magic Square of Harmony. I wanted to activate my Third Eye for more details, but before I could, I saw the ice shards open wide, biting deeply into the Gigas’s left shoulder.

What followed was nothing short of spectacular.

*Paang!*

The Gigas’s left arm, likely due to An-sol’s spell, was bathed in white light. It flinched as the light enveloped its arm, its movements visibly slowing. And in that moment of hesitation—

*Crunch! Crack!*

The ice shards bit into the Gigas’s left arm again, top and bottom, spreading across it. The creature, startled, frantically shook its arm, but An-sol’s spell lingered, preventing it from shaking off the magic.

The final touch, likely Shin Sang-yong’s spell, brought the magic to its peak. The ice shards, burrowing into the Gigas’s tough hide, served as conduits. Like a syringe, the fiery energy trapped within the ice surged through the channels into the creature’s body. It was, in essence, injecting magic directly into the giant’s flesh—a ruthlessly effective method.

*Boom! Kaboom!*

“Rraaaagh!”

A tremendous explosion echoed from within the Gigas’s left arm, its skin bulging grotesquely. No matter how strong its magic resistance, it couldn’t withstand magic injected directly into its body. The Gigas roared in agony. The explosion sounded like a Burn Flare spell. That had to hurt.

I watched each step, but the entire sequence unfolded in just two to three seconds. I was struck by newfound respect for the trio. This spell was impressive enough to hold its own anywhere. Though it appeared as three spells, there was likely far more magical finesse woven in. An-sol probably didn’t think of this—Jeong Ha-yeon and Shin Sang-yong were the masterminds.

They were clever. Their spell looked two, no, three steps ahead. By sending an explosive spell into the body, they burned the blood in its left arm. While the blood’s magic resistance prevented it from being entirely consumed, it was enough to weaken the arm’s resistance significantly.

As proof, An-sol’s Shackles spell and Jeong Ha-yeon’s ice magic were regaining strength. The mages hadn’t aimed for direct damage but instead created an opening for me. Vivian restrained the right arm, and the three mages had successfully bound the left.

With both arms restrained, the Gigas was a sitting duck. It had displayed the greatest stamina and durability of any foe we’d faced, but our relentless assault had worn it down considerably. Missing this moment would undermine my authority as a leader.

Already prepared to leap, I pushed off the ground with force. Feeling the rush of wind, I soared into the air. The Gigas’s left arm was now tattered, resembling a torn rag. Normally, it would have swung both arms to block my approach, but now it couldn’t. Moving recklessly with the ice magic gripping its arm risked tearing it apart.

The Gigas’s face was a whirlwind of emotions—futility, anguish, and shock.

I leaped high, nearly grazing the ceiling, and used the momentum of my descent to aim my sword forward. I lowered my head. The Gigas, tracking my movement, tilted its head upward.

Our eyes met. As I plummeted, I swung my sword down toward its head.
