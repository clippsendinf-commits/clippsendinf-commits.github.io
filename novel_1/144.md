# Chapter 143: Mental Illness

The bat kept a tantalizingly elusive distance, just out of reach, and I swung my sword with utmost care to avoid further injury. The absurd chase went on for a while until it abruptly ended when we reached a certain spot. I stared blankly at the bat as it frantically flapped away into the air, a twinge of embarrassment washing over me.

With the bat gone, I figured I’d arrived at the place where those guys were up to no good. Should I charge in? Could it be a trap? Or did they have some other plan? My heart raced with anticipation as I waited for them to show themselves.

“…”

*Swish. Swish.*

A cold breeze rustled through the bushes and leaves several times. Minutes passed, but no one appeared. I was tempted to activate my mana detection or Third Eye, but I barely held back. Just as I was about to scowl in frustration—

“…!”

“*Huff… huff…*”

A faint moan carried on the wind reached my ears. It sounded like a cry, yet it had an oddly feverish tone, accompanied by heavy, ragged breathing. Drawn to the sound, I slowly moved forward. Pushing through the dense foliage, I caught sight of a small clearing up ahead.

The clearing was surrounded by large rocks and tall trees. I scanned the area, mentally mapping the terrain. Their strategy was crude, but they seemed to have a basic grasp of ambush tactics. I took a deep breath to steady myself, closing the distance to the clearing. And then, before my eyes…

“Aaah! No, stop! Please, stop!”

“*Huff, huff, huff, huff!*”

“Please… stop… I beg you… have mercy!”

“*Huff, huff!* Shut your mouth already!”

I stood speechless, staring at the scene unfolding before me. A strange, heated sensation coursed through my body. In the clearing, a male user was violently assaulting a female user.

The female user was on her hands and knees, pressed against the ground. The male user had grabbed her hair, forcing her head up. Tears streamed from her pleading eyes, and her mouth begged endlessly for mercy, but the man behind her showed no hint of compassion, relentlessly thrusting with fervor.

“Aaah! Aaah! No, please! Stop! *Mmph!*”

*Slap. Slap.* The lewd sound of flesh colliding filled the clearing. Annoyed by her moans, the man clamped his free hand over her mouth. He pulled back his hips and then drove forward with force. Her desperate cries slipped through the gaps of his fingers.

The man, grunting like a beast, moved his hips roughly for a while before finally pressing himself tightly against her, as if a signal had gone off. His body began to tremble violently.

“Ha… that was good.”

“*Ugh… sob…*”

Each shudder of the man’s body caused the woman’s to twitch intermittently. After what seemed like a moment of lingering satisfaction, he released her hair and straightened his knees. The woman collapsed immediately, her body crumpling to the ground. Between her slightly parted thighs, her reddened skin was visible, and a few streaks of white fluid dripped onto the earth. It was a pitiful sight.

I stood watching them silently and took a step forward.

“Who’s there?!”

As I deliberately made my presence known, the man, who had been smirking, whipped his head around and shouted sharply. Since it no longer mattered, I activated my Third Eye.

“You! How long have you been there?”

“Since it ended. By the way, what’s going on here…?”

After quickly scanning their information, I raised my sword. Noticing my wary glare, Kim Seung-beom immediately raised both hands and shook his head.

“Whoa, whoa, friend. Calm down and hear me out. Put the sword down first.”

“I don’t have anything to hear from a rapist.”

“Come on, it’s a misunderstanding. Let me explain how this happened…”

“Run away! This man’s a vagrant!”

Just as Kim Seung-beom tried to speak, Choi Ju-hyeon, who had been lying still as if dead, shouted loudly. She lifted her head sharply and continued.

“Don’t listen to him! He’s not alone! His allies are nearby… *Agh!*”

“Shut up, you crazy bitch!”

Kim Seung-beom kicked her without hesitation, striking her face. She screamed, clutching her face, while he stomped on her and growled in a low voice.

“Damn it… you’ve ruined everything. *Spit.*”

I wondered how he’d react if I said, “Alright, I’ll leave. Goodbye,” and turned away. But that wasn’t an option. With a tenser expression, I aimed my sword at him.

“So, you’re a vagrant after all. Despicable scum.”

“Hmph. Fine, I’ll admit it. I’m a vagrant. But I don’t want to fight you.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

When I narrowed my eyes and questioned him, I saw him swallow hard. Let’s hear what nonsense he’s about to spout.

“Aren’t you one of the users who left Mul a few days ago?”

“How did you—”

I widened my eyes, feigning surprise, and Kim Seung-beom tapped his foot on Choi Ju-hyeon with a knowing look.

“To cut to the chase, you were being followed. By her group.”

“Followed?”

“Yeah. Eight users formed a caravan and were secretly trailing your party. We weren’t after you—we were after her group. You could say we’re practically your saviors.”

“So, you’re saying her caravan was planning to ambush us?”

“Maybe. Or they were waiting for you to uncover a ruin so they could stab you in the back.”

After Kim Seung-beom finished, I looked at the woman with disbelief. She avoided my gaze, looking flustered, and I bit my lip hard. Noticing my expression, Kim Seung-beom continued in a smoother tone.

“Look, we’re not going to talk about debts between users and vagrants. Let’s just avoid a pointless fight. Honestly, taking down her group wasn’t without losses for us. We achieved our goal, and you got your tails cleaned up without getting your hands dirty. If you want a fight, I won’t stop you, but this way, we both come out ahead. So let’s part ways.”

“Hmm.”

I let out a low hum and slightly lowered my sword. Kim Seung-beom grinned and nodded, while Choi Ju-hyeon looked at me with conflicted eyes. Her lips slowly parted.

“Don’t fall for it! The vagrants with him aren’t that badly hurt. One or two at most. They overwhelmed us in an instant. Don’t let your guard down… *Ugh!*”

Choi Ju-hyeon couldn’t finish. Kim Seung-beom kicked her again. As she curled up, he spat out harsh curses. She looked so pitiful and wretched that I decided it was time to play along. Dragging this out any longer would just turn it into a farce.

“Enough, vagrant.”

*Clank!*

I raised my sword again, aiming it firmly. Kim Seung-beom, who had been kicking her enthusiastically (and, by the way, not faking it—there seemed to be some personal grudge), looked at me with sunken eyes.

“What’s that? I thought we were settling this peacefully.”

“They taught us at the User Academy: never compromise with vagrants.”

“Hah. This is why zero-year newbies are hopeless. No flexibility.”

A slip of the tongue. He didn’t need to mention “zero-year user.” That confirmed it—I could finally let go of any lingering doubts. There was nothing holding me back now.

“I don’t exactly have a high opinion of that user either. But you… you’re definitely an <enemy>.”

“Fine. If you’re so eager to get yourself killed, I won’t stop you… *Ugh?!*”

Kim Seung-beom shrugged and bent down to gather his clothes and gear. Just as his hand reached for a thin sword, his body lurched.

“You bitch!”

The moment I raised my sword again, Choi Ju-hyeon swiftly grabbed his legs with both arms. He fell dramatically with a loud thud, and she seized the chance to snatch his weapon and scatter his equipment.

“…Haa.”

I let out a quiet sigh. All that from just grabbing his legs? And the sword she picked up was unusually thin for a male user’s weapon. I decided it was best to stop thinking altogether.

Choi Ju-hyeon staggered to her feet, and I responded by slowly closing the distance to the man. Kim Seung-beom quickly scrambled up and leaped back. The sight of his dangling parts was far from pleasant.

For a moment, silence hung between me, Choi Ju-hyeon, and Kim Seung-beom. We held weapons; he stood naked, unarmed. Gritting his teeth, he spat out a clichéd line—“Damn it, you’ll pay for this!”—and vanished into the bushes. I moved to chase him, but a hand grabbed my sleeve.

“Don’t go! It might be a trap. He’s probably running to his allies.”

“…Hm.”

At her cry, I hesitated and relaxed my stance. Charging in now would play right into their hands, but why did she stop me? Was there another scheme? I cautiously turned to face Choi Ju-hyeon, who was covering herself with an anxious expression, and sneered.

“Tch, tch. What a tragedy. Why did you follow us in the first place…?”

I glared at her, and she opened and closed her mouth, speechless. Then, with a look of genuine regret, tears began to fall.

“I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…”

She nearly collapsed, apologizing repeatedly while covering her mouth and sobbing. Without prompting, she began rambling about what she’d done. For a woman who’d just been assaulted, her behavior seemed oddly composed.

She spoke of a harsh life, seeing new users arrive in Mul, and growing envious of their increasingly impressive equipment. While secretly tailing us, her group was ambushed by vagrants. Her companions were all killed, leaving her as the sole survivor, used as a tool to sate the vagrants’ desires.

Listening to Choi Ju-hyeon, I couldn’t help but feel a bit impressed. The one who lured me here and the one who planned this were likely different people. I was certain of it. Otherwise, they couldn’t have crafted such a meticulous scheme.

As Go Yeon-ju had said, there was a cautious one among them. They weren’t just after us—they were also eyeing potential gains, like ruins. That’s probably why they used Choi Ju-hyeon as bait. Of course, I could abandon her, but that would be as good as leaving her to die. They were banking on a zero-year user’s sense of justice. If I left her behind, I’d likely be ambushed on my way back.

They mixed truth with lies and lies with truth. The script was well-written, but they overlooked a few things: namely, that I was their opponent, and their actors’ performances were lacking. Those were their mistakes.

I was a ten-year veteran who’d been through every kind of battle—open fields, seas, skies, and cities. Most tricks were obvious to me at a glance. But if I were truly a zero-year user, or if it had been one of the others here instead of me, they might have fallen for it.

“The greed for money and equipment blinded me… *sob*… My companions are all dead, and the equipment we had… *waaah*…”

She broke off, weeping piteously. I looked at her quietly, then approached with a softened expression.
