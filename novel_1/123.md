# Chapter 122: A Peaceful Daily Life

“*Kek.* In the end, you and I are no different. Don’t think you’ve won.”

“Did you say your name was Kim Su-hyeon? Fine… you want to save them, don’t you? You probably can. And those women probably want you to save them too. They’ll likely tempt you to do so.”

“The barking of a loser. It might sound like that to you. But mark my words: in the end, you’ll be played by those women… *Argh…!*”

---

The sudden recollection of my first cycle sent a surge of heat through my chest. I quickly shook off the memories of Seraph. There was a time I trusted her. But, just as *they* said, nothing changed after I obtained the Zero Code. If anything, it was exactly as *they* had warned…

For now, there were no more places to visit today. The investigations into the reported expeditions were taking longer, which meant our stay in this city would be extended. Still, I decided it was best to stick to the original plan for now. Any issues caused by the delay could be assessed after returning from the Cave of Screams. I initially planned to head back to the inn, but on second thought, I decided to stop by the library first.

I clearly remembered the route to the Cave of Screams. Even so, it was necessary to show my party that I was reviewing the records. Even if it was just for appearances, it wouldn’t hurt to double-check with the mindset of tapping a stone bridge before crossing. No matter how thorough the preparations, they could never be too meticulous.

Finding the records didn’t take long. After locating the documents about the Cave of Screams in the library, I immediately headed back to the inn.

The *Modest Lady* inn was, as expected, devoid of users. At this rate, it was bound to go under. I spared a moment of sympathy for Go Yeon-ju, who was sitting at the counter, sighing heavily, before climbing the stairs to the third floor.

Upon entering the third floor and opening the door to the deluxe room in the center, I saw Vivian and An-hyeon sitting side by side at the table. On the table was the record of the ancient spearman obtained from the Ruined Laboratory. It seemed An-hyeon had asked Vivian to help decipher the ancient text.

As I stepped into the room, Vivian, who was busily scribbling with a quill pen, and An-hyeon, who was intently reading the translated text, both looked up sharply.

“*Eek?!*”

The moment Vivian saw me, she hurriedly took off the glasses she was wearing. I couldn’t understand why she was so insistent on wearing glasses that didn’t even suit her, but I decided to respect her preference. An-hyeon, who had been quietly studying the translated records beside her, greeted me with a warm expression.

“Hyung.”

“Hey. Is Vivian helping you with the translation?”

“Yeah. There are some illustrations, but I can’t make much sense of them just by looking.”

An-hyeon answered clearly. Noticing that I didn’t comment on her glasses, Vivian seemed slightly relieved as she chimed in.

“Yup. But there’s quite a bit of text. Translating it all at once would take a while, so I’m doing it bit by bit and giving him the completed sections.”

“Hmm. That’s not a bad approach. It’s good to thoroughly master the translated parts before moving on.”

An-hyeon nodded, as if that had been his plan all along. He tilted his head slightly to peek at the records Vivian had translated. However, his expression darkened, as if things weren’t going as smoothly as he’d hoped. Perhaps sensing the difficulty, An-hyeon smacked his lips and spoke to me.

“Hyung, I’ve got something to say. I looked at some of the content, and it’s really tough. I think I’ll hit a lot of roadblocks. Could you maybe guide me from time to time?”

“From time to time? Sure, that’s not a problem.”

At my casual agreement, An-hyeon’s face lit up instantly. It seemed he’d been bothered by the fact that Yu-jeong was receiving my guidance despite him already having a Rare Class. While I wouldn’t be teaching An-hyeon swordsmanship, my mastery of *Mind and Sword as One* at EX rank meant I could handle a spear to some extent. Offering advice here and there wouldn’t be an issue.

After gathering my belongings for the workroom, I turned my attention to Vivian, who was preparing to dive back into her translation. I had an important task for her. I’d meant to mention it before leaving this morning, but I’d forgotten after making her cry.

“Vivian, once you’re done with that translation, come to my workroom.”

She looked up from her work at my call.

“Huh? Why?”

“There’s something I need to ask you to do.”

“Mm… okay. I’ll finish up soon and head over.”

Vivian’s face fell, likely recalling the morning’s incident. On closer inspection, her eyes were still slightly red—she must have been really upset. I gave an awkward smile, grabbed my things, and headed to the workroom.

After roughly organizing my belongings, I sat at the large table and pulled out a book. It was the record from Vivian’s dungeon, detailing how to inherit the Rare Class *Chimera Alchemist*. I sank into thought as I looked at it.

This record was best suited for Shin Sang-yong. His class, *Harmony Magic Circle*, synergized well with its unique skills, and he was a rare mage who had mastered alchemical magic. His stats as a user were solid, meeting the threshold I’d set. Still, I couldn’t shake a slight unease about handing it over so easily.

A Rare Class was incredibly valuable. Giving it to someone meant they’d be tied to us for the long haul. The question was whether I could trust Shin Sang-yong enough to make that commitment, and honestly, it was a bit of a gray area.

Shin Sang-yong had generally left a good impression and shown dedication to the group. His disposition wasn’t bad either. But the immense value of a Rare Class made me hesitate to hand it over impulsively.

On the other hand, dawdling wasn’t a good option either. If I decided to give it to him, doing so quickly would maximize his growth potential. As a second-year user, his stats were nearly fully developed, but meeting Vivian had raised his limits. If he inherited a Rare Class now, he could push those limits even further. Gaining a new special ability and boosting his magic stat to the early 90s would make him a tremendous asset.

“I was hoping to find a promising candidate to give this to… what a delightful dilemma.”

Muttering to myself, I chuckled at the so-called “happy problem.” Just then, I heard a knock at the door. I looked up and called out for them to come in, and a voice tinged with unease came from the other side.

“Kim Su-hyeon, I’m really coming in.”

“…Huh? Yeah, I said come in.”

After my second permission, the door opened cautiously. As expected, Vivian stepped inside with hesitant, shuffling steps. It seemed the morning’s teasing had left some lingering resentment.

“Why are you coming in like that? Anyway, come sit down.”

“N-no, I’m fine standing here.”

I let out a wry laugh as Vivian waved off my invitation. I wasn’t in the mood to tease her further, so I quickly got to the point.

“Alright then. I have a task for you.”

“Okay.”

“But first… I’ll likely be guiding Shin Sang-yong a lot moving forward. What’s your impression of him?”

Vivian tilted her head, seemingly puzzled by my question at first. But seeing my serious expression, she fell into thought. Since she’d spent more time with Shin Sang-yong than I had, she might have a better sense of him.

However, she shook her head.

“I’m not sure. It feels like an important question, so I don’t want to speak carelessly. He seems like a decent person, though. Polite, kind, though a bit clumsy with words.”

“Hmm. So you’re saying it’s hard to judge right now.”

“Yeah. I’ve mostly focused on teaching him, so I can only comment on what I’ve seen. He seems like a good person. But why are you asking?”

I sighed and nodded, then slid the record across the table toward her. When Vivian stepped closer and saw it, her eyes widened.

“This is…”

“Users who can handle blessings can gain power beyond their current class through it. For now, hold onto it. And when the time comes, give it to Shin Sang-yong.”

“Give this to Shin Sang-yong? Just like that?”

“Of course not just like that. Let me explain the conditions.”

Seeing Vivian’s alarmed reaction, I added a few conditions. First, if he agrees to join the clan after tonight’s discussion, that’s the first condition met. Second, as Vivian guides him, she should assess his character, and if she deems him trustworthy, that’s the second condition. Finally, for the third condition, I’d personally talk with him and make a final evaluation after he clears the first two.

After explaining the three-step process, Vivian nodded in understanding.

“So, I can only give it to him with your final approval?”

“Pretty much. It’s too valuable to hand over lightly.”

“It’s that valuable? *Hehe*, that’s kind of embarrassing. Should I write a few more?”

I gave a faint smile and shook my head at her playful remark. Vivian didn’t know, but that book contained the *settings* of the angels. Honestly, I’d expected Seraph to say something about Vivian when we met this time, but she hadn’t, which was a bit surprising. Or maybe I left before she could. In any case, unless the angels collectively lost their minds, they wouldn’t imbue books mass-produced by Vivian with the same *settings*.

“Even if you wrote more, they wouldn’t have the same impact as this one. They’d be useful as reference material for alchemists, but that’s about it. This record holds a latent power accumulated over ages. It’s similar to what An-hyeon experienced in the laboratory.”

“Hmm, I see.”

Vivian’s expression turned coy as she listened, but a faint smile crept onto her lips. She seemed pleased to hear her work so highly praised. Her personality was refreshingly straightforward, and I decided it was best to keep the mood light. So, I continued in a softer tone.

“That’s why I think it’s better for you to hold onto it for now. I’ll talk about the clan tonight, and I’ll let you know the outcome tomorrow. It’s almost certain he’ll join, though. For now, the most important thing is the task I’m entrusting to you. Don’t just focus on teaching him—pay close attention to what kind of person Shin Sang-yong is.”

“Okay! I’ll observe him closely. If Shin Sang-yong passes, does that mean I’ll have my first official disciple? *Hoho*.”

“Something like that. Anyway, that’s all I had to say. You can go now.”

Vivian’s face lit up with confidence and enthusiasm. Seeing her so motivated warmed my heart, and I promptly dismissed her. I needed to prepare what I’d say to the others about the clan.

But at my dismissal, Vivian’s face immediately soured.

“Huh? Go?”

“Uh, yeah.”

What else was she expecting? Vivian shot me a look of dissatisfaction. I gazed back, feeling a mix of emotions. She was sulky one moment, cheerful the next, and now disgruntled again. Few people could display such a range of emotions in so short a time. But that was also part of Vivian’s charm—her inability to hide her feelings.

What she said next, however, left me utterly shocked.

“You’re not going to tease me anymore?”

“…?”

“I mean, are you done teasing me for today? I came in here prepared, you know.”

It took me exactly two seconds to process her words. I tapped my fingers on the table for a moment before firmly pointing to the door—a clear signal to leave. Vivian pouted but turned to go.

As I kept my finger pointed toward the exit, she kept glancing back with a reluctant expression. She’d take a step or two, look at me, take another couple of steps, and look again, like a puppy desperate to go outside. Watching her sneak those furtive glances, a strange thought crossed my mind.

Somehow, it felt like both Vivian and I had stirred up some dangerous emotions in each other.
