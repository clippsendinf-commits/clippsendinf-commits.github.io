# Chapter 31: The Rat Game

The few people outside the room were participating in a game actively for the first time, and each of them felt somewhat nervous.

"Qi Xia," Lin Qin called out.

"What is it?"

"You once said that different animals represent different types of games, right?"

"That should be the case."

After hearing this, Lin Qin looked at the Human Rat before her, then asked in a low voice, "What do you think a 'Rat Game' is?"

Qi Xia was also considering this question. If they didn't know the game type in advance, Tian Tian's situation would be rather passive.

But what was associated with "rats"?

"It seems the game currently being played matches the characteristics of 'rats' - searching for a target among numerous items," Qi Xia said in a low voice. "Could it be that 'Rat' refers to 'searching' type games?"

...

Inside the room, Tian Tian first scanned the room generally and found many shelves.

Each shelf was filled with cardboard boxes of various sizes. At a glance, there were at least a hundred of them.

Tian Tian randomly picked up a cardboard box and looked inside. It was filled with miscellaneous items.

She calculated in her mind that if she were to open all these boxes one by one within five minutes and search through their contents, it would be impossible to find the "Dao" - there were simply too many boxes.

She looked up again and noticed that in this not-so-large warehouse, there was only one incandescent lamp, and the switch was on the wall beside her.

Tian Tian thought for a few seconds, then suddenly had an idea.

She gathered her strength and directly pushed over a shelf, creating a loud noise.

The people outside immediately became panicked upon hearing this.

"Hey! Miss, are you alright?" Qiao Jiajin shouted loudly.

"I'm fine," Tian Tian said loudly. "I just thought of a method."

Qi Xia thought for a moment, then nodded and said, "That's right, it is indeed a good method."

"Huh?" Qiao Jiajin was taken aback. "You know that too? Do you two have some kind of 'secret voice transmission' from martial arts novels?"

The sound from inside the room grew louder as Tian Tian pushed over all the shelves, and cardboard boxes scattered all over the floor.

Various items spilled out at once.

Some boxes contained plastic plates and bowls, some contained old clothes, and others contained waste paper.

She then walked to several intact boxes and stomped on them forcefully. In no time, the once tidy warehouse had become a complete mess.

Panting, she looked around and felt the time was about right, then walked to the wall and turned off the incandescent lamp.

The room instantly became pitch dark, with only the sound of Tian Tian's breathing audible.

"This..." Tian Tian looked around and slowly frowned.

In her memory, the small ball called "Dao" emitted a faint light. If the miscellaneous items were scattered all over the floor, there was a high probability of discovering the "Dao" in the darkness.

But the moment she turned off the light, the entire room fell into darkness, without a single trace of light.

She couldn't believe it and bravely walked forward, constantly kicking various cardboard boxes with her feet to expand her search area.

Why would a glowing ball completely disappear in a dark room?

After kicking for a while, Tian Tian felt that she had opened all the boxes, but still found nothing that was glowing.

At this moment, the Human Rat knocked on the door from outside and said, "Ten seconds remaining."

Tian Tian shook her head helplessly and turned on the light.

With the sudden illumination, she discovered that she was actually standing on a box of canned goods. The cans, previously in the cardboard box, had now spilled all over the floor.

She reached out, picked up a can, and read the label, finding that it contained "beans."

Tian Tian shook the can, and indeed heard a "rustling" sound.

"I feel like such an idiot..." Tian Tian gritted her teeth. "Could it be in these cans?!"

"Creakâ€”"

The Human Rat twisted the handle from outside and pushed open the door: "Time's up. Challenge failed."

Tian Tian was startled and looked up, directly facing the strange face of the Human Rat.

The three people outside immediately rushed forward. Qiao Jiajin asked, "How is it, Miss? Did you find it?"

"No..." Tian Tian threw down the can and stood up with a sad expression. "I suspect the 'Dao' is in these cans, but opening dozens of cans by hand within five minutes... isn't an easy task either."

Qi Xia looked down and saw that these were all fava bean cans, which would be a reasonable place to hide a "Dao."

But he still felt that something wasn't quite right.

Tian Tian exited the room dejectedly, looking at the Human Rat with some panic.

But the Human Rat made no other moves. She just closed the door and continued standing at the entrance.

"So it's really just losing one 'Dao'?" Tian Tian asked in a low voice. "She's not going to take my life..."

The Human Rat smiled and asked, "When did I say I would take your life?"

Seeing this scene, Qiao Jiajin seemed to understand: "I say... Con Artist, if that's the case... we can try again, right?"

"Try again?" Qi Xia frowned.

"We already know the 'Dao' is most likely in those cans. This time, we can go directly for the cans. Besides, she won't kill us anyway."

Qi Xia looked at his pocket, where only one "Dao" remained.

The "Human Dragon" had once said that these "Dao" were both their rewards and their "chips."

From this perspective, participating in these games required paying a certain amount of "Dao" to gamble with the other party. If they consumed too many "Dao" here, they wouldn't be able to participate in future games.
