# Chapter 36: Earth Ox

"How do we earn 'Dao'?" Qi Xia asked again.

"We found an ox-type game. According to the rules, you can earn a large amount of 'Dao,' but that game requires twenty people to start. We're still short five people. Would you like to join us?"

"Short five people?" Qi Xia was startled. "You've already gathered fifteen people?"

It seemed there really were many participants here.

"That's right." The glasses-wearing man nodded, pointing to the distance. Indeed, there was a crowd of people there.

Qi Xia pondered for a moment, then nodded and said, "Alright, let's go take a look."

"Great! I'll go wait for you over there!" The glasses-wearing man tactfully walked away.

"Hey!" Qiao Jiajin felt something was off. "We're going together?! What if that's a violent gang? Do you want me to show you my skills?"

"It won't be," Qi Xia said. "Each room can only have nine people at most. In this environment, it's too difficult to form a gang of more than ten people. Not to mention these strangers, even we who came from the same room don't necessarily fully trust each other."

As he spoke, he glanced at Lin Qin, as if implying something.

Lin Qin seemed displeased, apparently not understanding why she was being suspected. Was it just because she didn't recognize that "flyer"?

After walking down an old road, the four of them arrived in front of a large building.

Just as the glasses-wearing man had said, a man wearing an ox mask stood at the entrance of the large building.

The many participants outside stood in small groups of two or three, deliberately keeping their distance from each other.

Although these people were all strangers, seeing so many normal people gathered together, Qi Xia and his companions still felt a long-lost sense of relief.

Even if these people looked unpleasant, they were living beings.

"Not bad, Little Glasses!" A middle-aged man patted the glasses-wearing man on the shoulder. "You found four people at once!"

Qi Xia looked at the ox-headed man before him and stepped forward to ask, "What are the game rules?"

The ox-headed man said calmly, "Ox-type game, one 'Dao' per person for entry, requires twenty people to start. Players will be eliminated during the game. When the game ends, each player remaining on the field will receive 'Dao' equal to the number of players who clear the game."

"'Dao' equal to the number of players who clear the game?!" Qi Xia was stunned. "You mean, if twenty people remain on the field at the end, then each of these twenty people will receive twenty 'Dao'?!"

"Yes."

Qiao Jiajin's mouth fell open upon hearing this. "Damn! Wouldn't that make us rich in one go?! That's four hundred 'Dao' at once!"

"Can it be this easy..." Tian Tian felt somewhat incredulous. "Hey, Human Ox, you won't go back on your word, will you?"

The ox-headed man was silent for a moment, then shook his head and said, "Please allow me to correct you. I am not 'Human Ox'."

"Not 'Human Ox'?" Tian Tian looked at the large man before her in confusion. "But don't you all have names starting with 'Human'?"

"I am 'Earth Ox.'" The ox-headed man said calmly. "If you think I'm 'Human Ox,' you'll regret it."

Everyone then noticed that the "Earth Ox" before them was indeed different from the animal masks they had seen before. His mask was very clean, almost lifelike as if it were a living ox. His black suit was spotless, as if specially ironed. When he spoke... it seemed as if the mouth of the mask was moving slightly.

But what was the difference between Human Ox and Earth Ox?

"Earth Ox..." Qi Xia scratched his head, unable to understand the relationship. He looked up again and asked, "Earth Ox, what is your game?"

Earth Ox paused for a moment, then said, "Pay the entrance fee, know the content."

"Pay the entrance fee..."

The only thing Qi Xia cared about now was that if all four of them participated in the game at the same time, the tactics they had discussed earlier would become ineffective.

All four of them would be thrown into an unknown game simultaneously, which was extremely risky.

But if it was a game with such high stakes, the risk and reward seemed to be proportional.

"Con artist, what type of game do you think the 'Ox' game is?" Qiao Jiajin asked from the side.

Qi Xia pondered for a moment, then answered, "I estimate it's the type I hate the most."

"Oh? You have a type of game you hate?" Qiao Jiajin suddenly became interested. "What is it?"

"'Ox'en are born to labor diligently. If I'm not mistaken, it should be a 'physical-type' game." Qi Xia glanced at Qiao Jiajin. "It might be more suitable for a brute like you."

"Ha!" Qiao Jiajin rolled up his sleeves, revealing his strong tattooed arms. "Finally, it's my turn to shine... wait, who are you calling a brute?"

Qi Xia shook his head helplessly and said, "If not for the sake of 'Dao,' I probably wouldn't enter the 'Ox' room."

"Don't worry, just call me 'boss,' and I'll get you through any ox-type game." Qiao Jiajin said with a mischievous grin. "Sounds like a good deal, right?"

Qi Xia turned back to look at Qiao Jiajin before him: "You and I look about the same age, at most twenty-six or twenty-seven. Why should I call you 'boss'?"

"If you're going to say that, I need to have a serious talk with you!" Qiao Jiajin scratched his head. "What year were you born?"

Qi Xia always felt that Qiao Jiajin had a fearless aura, able to joke around in such a repressive environment.

"Instead of wasting your energy on this, you might as well warm up early." Qi Xia replied indifferently. "So you don't get cramps later."
