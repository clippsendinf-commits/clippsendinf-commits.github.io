# Chapter 52: The Extreme Way

Xiao Xiao casually smashed a table, picked up a piece of wood with nails from the floor, and slowly walked toward Qiao Jiajin.

"Hey!!" Qi Xia sensed something was wrong. "What are you doing?! Wait a moment..."

"These people are dead once they die," Xiao Xiao said. "Their deaths mean nothing. I'll prove it to you."

"Don't!" Qi Xia shouted anxiously. "I understand! I'll do everything you say, just put that thing down first!"

Xiao Xiao acted as if she heard nothing, slowly raising the wooden board in her hand.

"Hey! I agree to all your conditions! You don't need to prove it to me!!"

Seeing Xiao Xiao acting as if she'd gone mad, Qi Xia quickly called out to Qiao Jiajin: "Hey! Qiao Jiajin! Stop pretending to be dead! Get up!!"

As soon as the words left his mouth, Xiao Xiao's board came down, the nail-studded side directly piercing Qiao Jiajin's skull.

"Long live the Extreme Way," she said with a smile.

Qiao Jiajin's whole body trembled, his limbs convulsed violently several times, then fell silent.

"Hey... Qiao Jiajin..."

Qi Xia's eyes widened, his lips trembling slightly.

"Say something, Qiao Jiajin... What the hell are you pretending... A bear couldn't kill you... How could a nail possibly kill you...?"

Qi Xia didn't wait for Qiao Jiajin's answer, but instead saw the spreading bloodstain.

He knew that with a nail driven into the brain, no one could survive.

Qiao Jiajin was dead.

"Qiao..." Qi Xia stared in disbelief at the scene before him, a phrase echoing repeatedly in his mind...

"You have the brains, I have the strength, let's work together?"

"Qi Xia, look," Xiao Xiao said with a smile. "Their deaths mean nothing."

"Ahhhâ€”"

Qi Xia suddenly let out a miserable scream, a sharp pain coming from deep within his mind. His hands and feet instantly regained sensation, but now he could only roll on the ground clutching his head.

Seeing that Qi Xia could suddenly move freely, Xiao Xiao paused briefly.

This headache lasted for a very long time. Qi Xia felt as if the nail hadn't pierced Qiao Jiajin, but instead had been driven into his own brain, constantly stirring his brain matter, making life worse than death.

Two minutes later, Qi Xia's headache suddenly disappeared. He stood up with a blank expression.

"Amazing, Qi Xia," Xiao Xiao said with a smile. "Can you ignore my 'Echo'?"

"I advise you to stop while you're ahead..." Qi Xia said coldly. "Whatever issue you have, come at me..."

"No," Xiao Xiao said. "I need to make you understand that these people can be killed casually, and you can kill them too."

"Why should I kill them..." Qi Xia's eyes were extremely cold, his entire person appearing devoid of any emotion. "I'm different from you lunatics. Don't compare me to you."

"It seems you still don't understand." Xiao Xiao shook her head helplessly, then with a flick of her wrist, pulled the nail-studded board from Qiao Jiajin's head. She shook off the blood and said to Qi Xia, "After I kill them all, you'll naturally understand."

After saying this, she walked directly toward Tian Tian.

"Lunatic, that's enough..." Qi Xia's lips trembled slightly. "The few of us have barely survived until now. By what right do you decide our life and death..."

"That's why I said it's meaningless." Xiao Xiao raised the board again.

This time, Qi Xia didn't give her a chance, immediately rushing forward. He had intended to knock the woman down, but under the tremendous impact, the woman didn't move at all.

Qi Xia could only change tactics on the spot, wrapping his arms around the woman's waist, which was as thick as a load-bearing wall, and pushing her backward.

Xiao Xiao took two steps back, her expression turning cold.

"Qi Xia, I'm clearly helping you, yet you remain stubborn. I'm disappointed." Xiao Xiao shook her head, grabbed Qi Xia's neck, and then casually threw him aside as if throwing a dog.

Qi Xia crashed against the wall, letting out a pained groan. He felt that the woman before him possessed extraordinary strength, having undergone rigorous training.

"Long live the Extreme Way." Xiao Xiao smiled, and the board in her hand came down again, piercing through Tian Tian's head.

Tian Tian's voice echoed in Qi Xia's mindâ€”

"I came here only because there was no place for me there."

That excruciating pain swept over him again. Qi Xia rolled on the ground, clutching his head and groaning in agony.

Tian Tian was dead too.

Qi Xia felt his head was about to split open.

Everything before him turned black, his consciousness gradually fading.

Before fainting, he heard another massive bell ringing in the distance.

...

"Xia, look." Yu Nian'an held up an old shirt, seemingly showing it off to Qi Xia. "Look here."

She extended her fair finger, pointing to the shirt's chest pocket, where a cartoon sheep was sewn.

"I've mended the place where you tore it! Not bad workmanship, right?"

"Not bad at all." Qi Xia nodded while slurping instant noodles. "But why not buy a new one?"

"To save money!" Yu Nian'an smiled. "When we have money in the future, you can buy as many as you want. For now, let's make do."

Qi Xia paused after hearing this, put down his instant noodles, and said: "Xiao'an, we'll have money soon. If my deal goes through, we'll have two million..."

"I believe you." Yu Nian'an nodded with a smile. "Xia, there are many paths in this world, and everyone has their own. I believe you will succeed."

"Mmm." Qi Xia nodded, feeling particularly at ease. He wanted to say more to Yu Nian'an but suddenly noticed the sky outside the window.
