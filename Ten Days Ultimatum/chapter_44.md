# Chapter 44 Zhang Shan

The originally orderly formation collapsed almost instantly, with everyone scattering in all directions. However, the black bear only chased after Little Glasses.

"It's over, it's over, it's over..." Little Glasses muttered desperately as he stumbled around the room, "Mom... I'm really going to die this time..."

Before he could take ten steps, the black bear had already cornered Little Glasses against the wall.

Little Glasses' legs completely gave out, and he collapsed to the ground, unable to move even an inch.

Leaning against the wall, he turned back to see a terrifying black face filling his vision.

Ugly, ferocious, and foul-smelling.

The black bear extended its nose and sniffed Little Glasses' face.

Little Glasses' face was pale, his gaze vacant as he stared ahead. He didn't dare move even as the black bear brought its mouth close to his neck.

"Mom..." Little Glasses muttered, "I can't go back... Mom... Don't wait for me..."

Just as the black bear opened its rotting-smelling mouth to bite down, Qiao Jiajin, who was lying on the ground, suddenly shouted.

"Hey!! Time's up!! You bastards!! Are you going to cheat?! Stop killing!!"

Everyone turned to look at the electronic clock on the wall, which had indeed finished its countdown, stopping at "0".

The next second, the iron door in the distance suddenly opened. The black bear froze.

Immediately after, a powerful attraction burst forth from the iron door. The black bear, like a piece of paper fluttering in the wind, let out a painful howl and was quickly dragged into the door by an invisible force.

The game was over.

Everyone had survived.

"It's... it's over..." After several minutes, a girl said tremblingly, "The black bear is gone..."

The girls slowly stood up, hugging each other, crying with joy.

Little Glasses seemed to have been scared silly, sitting on the ground and gasping for breath.

"Damn..." Qiao Jiajin moved his sore body, holding his abdomen with a tired expression, "That was really tough. Con artist, we owe it all to your 'Eagle Catches Chicks' strategy."

After standing up, Qi Xia didn't speak, his expression somewhat worried.

"What's wrong?" Qiao Jiajin asked.

"Do you think..." Qi Xia began to ask, "Did they survive?"

"They..."

Qiao Jiajin naturally knew Qi Xia was referring to Tian Tian and Lin Qin, but he didn't dare to guess randomly.

No one knew what had happened in the other room.

Were they in the same situation, being hunted by a black bear?

Could their teammates unite and come up with the 'Eagle Catches Chicks' strategy?

Everyone turned around to find that the staircase they had come up was now behind them.

"Stop thinking about it, let's just go see." Qiao Jiajin patted Qi Xia's shoulder, "Let's go."

Lao LÃ¼ helped Little Glasses up, and the group supported each other as they slowly climbed the stairs, returning to the room where the chairs had been.

Earth Ox stood quietly there, waiting for everyone's "triumphant return."

"Nine survivors?" Earth Ox paused slightly, "Not bad."

"Damn it..." Qiao Jiajin cursed softly, "One day I'm going to beat up these people."

"Please wait a moment. The people from the other room haven't returned yet." Earth Ox waved to them, indicating they should sit.

Everyone didn't hesitate, sitting down on the chairs. For those who had escaped death, nothing here could be more terrifying than that black bear.

After waiting for about two minutes, Qiao Jiajin couldn't sit still anymore.

"Hey, Old Ox. Is their game not over yet?"

"You both started at the same time, so it should be over now, but they haven't returned."

"What..." Qi Xia frowned, feeling a headache coming on. He quickly covered his forehead and asked the minotaur, "If the game is over but no one has returned, doesn't that mean they're all dead...?"

"I don't know." The minotaur shook its head, "Please everyone, sit and don't be anxious."

Though they were told not to be anxious, how could anyone not be?

This time, the teams had been randomly divided. In other words, almost everyone present had teammates assigned to the other team.

Qi Xia turned his head and saw Little Glasses sitting not far ahead, whispering something to a middle-aged man beside him.

"What?! How can that be?!" the middle-aged man exclaimed in surprise.

Little Glasses quickly waved at him, explaining in a low voice.

"No, no, I don't agree!" The middle-aged man shook his head like a rattle, "I won't agree to anything."

After saying this, he turned back and happened to meet Qi Xia's gaze, but immediately looked away as if he hadn't seen anything, then continued in a not-so-loud voice: "If that's really the case, I'll have to ask Zhang Shan to stand up for me!"

"Heh." Qi Xia sneered, roughly guessing the content of their conversation.

After waiting for a full five or six minutes, everyone finally heard heavy footsteps gradually emerging from a nearby door.

"They're here..."

Following these footsteps came the sound of many more footsteps.

It seemed this team had quite a few survivors too.

A large man slowly emerged from the dark door. His expression was stern as he quickly scanned everyone, a smile gradually appearing on his face: "Damn... you're all alive?"

"Zhang Shan! Zhang Shan!" Little Glasses excitedly ran forward, "Thank goodness! You're okay... Holy crap!!!"

Little Glasses shouted and quickly took a step back.

The scene before him was simply too horrifying.
