# Chapter 3: The Technical Person

"The Liar..."

Qi Xia repeated these three words in his mind, confirming his identity before quietly placing his card face down.

Just a minute ago, he had entertained the thought of "everyone leaving alive."

But now things were different.

Although he didn't know the eight people before him, this time, they had to be the ones to die.

"If there are no objections, please remember the rules. In this game, 'there is one and only one Liar'..." The Human Goat pointed a finger at the sexy girl to Qi Xia's left. "We'll start with you and proceed clockwise."

"Huh? Me?" The girl froze, then pouted.

Qi Xia glanced over. If they proceeded clockwise from the girl to his left, it wasn't advantageous for him.

He would be the last storyteller.

In a situation of extreme tension and oppression, people usually only remember the first and last storytellers.

But raising objections now would seem too conspicuous. He could only take it one step at a time.

The sexy girl frowned, her large eyes darting around before she finally sighed and said, "Alright... I'll go first, but I've never been good at telling stories. Please don't blame me if I don't tell it well..."

At this moment, no one knew what to say, so they could only listen quietly.

The sexy girl extended her slender fingers, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, and said:

"My name is Tian Tian, and I'm... uh... a 'technical worker.' We earn money with our skills, and I don't think there's anything to be ashamed of."

Only now did everyone notice that the girl named Tian Tian was wearing very littleâ€”just a dirty low-cut miniskirt that didn't properly cover what should have been covered.

But she didn't seem to care about this.

"Many of my stories aren't appropriate to share with everyone... Anyway, you can call me 'Action,' but asking me to 'Describe' is really difficult for me. After all, who with any education would do my job..."

"Anyway, I was working before I came here. But the client I met was really weird... Our shop clearly provides service venues, but he insisted on going to his car, saying it would be more exciting... So to make money, I had no choice but to go with him..."

"This was my first time working in a car. I didn't expect that although the car looked high-end, it was so narrow inside. I was sweating all over in no time. I really don't understand what's so 'exciting' about this broken place. During this time, the client's phone kept ringing, but he refused to answer it. I was really annoyed..."

Tian Tian seemed to want to curse the client a bit more, but her eyes accidentally glanced at the corpse on the table, immediately startling her. She took a deep breath and said:

"Oh, forget it. I chose this profession, and I accept it. But I never expected an 'earthquake' to happen suddenly. At first, I thought our movements were too intense, causing the violent shaking. Who knew it was a real earthquake."

At the mention of "earthquake," everyone's expressions slightly changed, as if remembering something.

"Our car was parked in an alley... Right above us was a huge billboard... At that moment, my head was sticking out of the car, and I saw it clearly." Tian Tian pointed to the top of her head, saying with a trembling voice, "That huge billboard broke off for some reason with a 'clang' and fell directly onto the car. I lost consciousness..."

She took another long breath and said: "When I woke up, I was here. I was really scared to death..."

Tian Tian showed a wronged expression, one that seemed to have been practiced, making men feel a flutter in their hearts when they saw it.

The tattooed man sitting next to her was slightly stunned and said: "Everyone, do we need to continue?"

The man in the white coat froze, looking at the tattooed man: "What do you mean?"

"This 'prostitute' has already lied. We can just vote directly." The tattooed man said with certainty.

"You...! What are you talking about?!" Tian Tian was startled. "Where did I lie?"

The tattooed man gave Tian Tian a cold glance and said: "Your name. You said your name is 'Tian Tian,' but all prostitutes use stage names. Names like 'Tian Tian,' 'Xiao Fang,' and 'Li Li' are very common stage names, so you've hidden your real name, which means you've already lied."

After this statement, Tian Tian's face turned red with frustration.

"You... You're talking nonsense! My name is Tian Tian! I haven't used my real name in years!" After saying this, she looked around at everyone and added, "At my workplace, only calling me 'Tian Tian' can find me. If you call my real name, no one will recognize me!"

Everyone began to ponder, and Qi Xia's expression also turned serious.

From Tian Tian's speech just now, Qi Xia couldn't detect any sense of lying. Her rhythm was steady, and her tone was relaxed when describing her story.

This storytelling technique, like chatting with friends, could only prove two results. Either the story she told was prepared long ago and she had told it many times to herself, or she was telling the truth.

But now the tattooed man had provided Qi Xia with another perspective.

That was "lying about one's name."

Lying about one's name doesn't involve logic or reasonability, making it difficult for ordinary people to detect any flaws.

After all, everyone present had never met before, and names could only be known through each other's accounts.

Qi Xia carefully recalled the Human Goat's words again. He said "among all the storytellers, there is one person who is lying." This rule didn't specify that the liar must use a "fake story" to lieâ€”a "fake name" would also apply.

Seeing that she was suspected, Tian Tian's eyes widened, looking very nervous: "If... if you still don't believe me, my real name is Zhang Lijuan... I'm from Shaanxi... You can try calling me by my real name. I won't respond to my real name; I'll only respond to 'Tian Tian'... I... I..."

Hearing this, Qi Xia silently shook his head.

This woman wasn't as smart as he had imagined.

In other words, she couldn't have prepared this lie in advance, nor could she have thought of the "name lie" strategy on the spot.

The Human Goat said "there is one and only one Liar," so that person could only be Qi Xia himself.

If no one else noticed the seriousness of the "Tian Tian" issue, then he had found a surefire way to win.

When it came to fabricating a name, "Qi" wasn't a good surname. Although not rare, it wasn't common either, and he needed to avoid such easily memorable surnames.

In other words, everything he narrated should be as inconspicuous as possible.

So he planned to call himself "Li Ming."

He could narrate the rest of his story normally, so even the most astute person wouldn't be able to detect any flaws.

The game was about to end.
