# Chapter 14: After the Rain

"Hold on!" Officer Li shouted, "The harpoons are limited in number! If we can hold on a little longer, we'll survive!"

Before anyone could respond, they heard another scream.

Turning their heads, they saw it was Tian Tian.

She wasn't as lucky as Xiao Ran. A piercing harpoon had torn through her palm.

Tian Tian suddenly lost her strength, and the table shield in front of her was knocked askew by the incoming harpoons.

"Be careful!"

Qiao Jiajin gritted his teeth and reached to grab the table shield in front of Tian Tian.

In that moment, a harpoon flew accurately through the gap, piercing Han Yimo's shoulder.

Han Yimo cried out in pain, but his hands still gripped the table shield tightly.

"Don't panic!"

Officer Li reached to support Han Yimo, then used both hands to hold up half of the table shield for him.

Qiao Jiajin also acted decisively, reaching to hold the table shield for Tian Tian.

Fortunately, these two were very strong, and the formation began to stabilize again.

As the crashing sounds gradually diminished, everyone finally understood how reasonable this formation was.

If they had followed Officer Li and Dr. Zhao's original idea of arranging the table shields in a staggered pattern held by everyone, then the table shields would be perpendicular to the harpoons, making them easily penetrable.

The current "Bamboo Shoots After Rain" formation made the contact surface between the harpoons from five directions and the table shields into angled surfaces, significantly reducing the penetrating power of the harpoons.

Especially the harpoons shooting from directly above, which now changed their trajectory due to the conical shape.

After another while, there was complete silence outside the table shields.

"Is it over?" Han Yimo asked through gritted teeth.

"Let's wait one more minute," Qi Xia replied.

Everyone held the table shields and waited quietly for another minute, finding that there was indeed no more movement outside.

Qiao Jiajin carefully moved aside a small gap to peek outside.

"Holy crap..." He was instantly stunned by the sight before him.

Everyone slowly moved the table shields aside, discovering that the floor and tabletop were almost completely covered with harpoons.

The two corpses on the ground were even more gruesome, now resembling hedgehogs, densely covered with spikes.

Each harpoon was connected by a rope, with the other end attached to holes in the walls. The room was now a complete mess.

Dr. Zhao immediately rolled up his sleeves and went to Han Yimo's side.

His condition was not optimistic. The harpoon had pierced his shoulder and needed immediate treatment.

Han Yimo slowly sat down with a bitter smile: "I was just wondering if I would be so unlucky, and I didn't expect to actually get hit..."

Tian Tian looked extremely guilty and quickly apologized to Han Yimo.

But everyone knew this wasn't Tian Tian's fault either, as her palm had also been pierced by a harpoon.

"Hey, pretty girl, come here," Qiao Jiajin beckoned, "I can bandage you for you."

"Huh?" Tian Tian was startled, "You know how to bandage?"

"Just a little."

Qiao Jiajin tore a strip of suit fabric from the dead Goat Head's body, then tore it into two pieces.

One piece was tightly tied around Tian Tian's arm to stop the bleeding, while the other was carefully wrapped around the wound.

"I often got injured when I was on the streets, so I learned some bandaging myself," Qiao Jiajin said.

Tian Tian nodded slightly without saying anything.

After coming here, everyone rarely had a moment of peace, as if they had temporarily escaped the shadow of death.

But still, no door appeared. This damned room was still trapping them here.

What kind of place was this?

And what was outside the room?

In less than a minute, a sigh came from Dr. Zhao's direction.

Qi Xia turned to look and saw Dr. Zhao, who was treating Han Yimo's wound, looking troubled.

"What's wrong?" Officer Li asked, "Is the injury serious?"

"The injury isn't too serious," Dr. Zhao shook his head, "But I can't remove the harpoon."

Everyone leaned closer and found that the problem was indeed tricky.

The tip of the harpoon had barbs, which would cause greater damage to the injured person if pulled out.

And the tail of the harpoon was connected to a rope.

At this moment, Han Yimo was like a fish that had been shot, no matter where he moved, he would be tightly held by this rope.

"We can only cut the rope and then pull out the harpoon from the front," Dr. Zhao looked up and said, "But I don't have a sharp tool on hand."

Han Yimo's lips were somewhat pale now, and the harpoon piercing his shoulder blade was causing him unbearable pain.

"Let's use another harpoon," Officer Li said decisively, "Although the harpoon is sharp, it's still a cutting tool."

"That's the only way," Dr. Zhao also nodded, "Writer, I need you to choose the most relaxed position to lie down. We need to cut the rope on your back. Don't rush, take your time. Be careful of the harpoon on your front, avoid getting injured again."

Han Yimo nodded and began to move his body with difficulty.

Qi Xia watched this scene and felt something was off.

Take your time?

Did they really have time to do that in this situation?

He looked at the ropes all over the floor, and an ominous premonition appeared in his mind.

If his guess was correct, they were still racing against time.

"We can't take our time!" Qi Xia suddenly said, "We need to get that harpoon out of him now!"

He quickly walked to the doctor's side and said seriously to Han Yimo: "Bear with it, I'll pull the harpoon out for you right now!"

Han Yimo was a bit confused but didn't refuse.

"What are you doing?!" Dr. Zhao pushed Qi Xia angrily, "You'll make his injury worse!"
