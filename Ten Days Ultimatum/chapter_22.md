# Chapter 22: The Clerk

"How disgusting..." Qiao Jiajin frowned as he looked at the filthy things on the ground. "This overwhelming stench... could it be excrement?"

Excrement?

Qi Xia suddenly turned to look at Qiao Jiajin.

That's an interesting perspective.

In other words, besides the nine of them and the animal mask, there are other people here.

Or rather... other 'things'.

This person or 'thing' seems to have lived here for a long time; otherwise, it wouldn't be possible to leave the ground covered in excrement.

Everyone searched around but couldn't find any needles, thread, or gauze. And there were no pharmacies or clinics visible outside the convenience store. If they went out blindly to search, Han Yimo probably wouldn't last that long.

"What should we do..." Officer Li put his hands on his hips, looking helplessly at Dr. Zhao, as if seeking his opinion.

Before Dr. Zhao could speak, there was a noise from behind the convenience store counter, and the door to the employee break room slowly opened.

The nine of them were horrified and immediately took a few steps back, looking at the slowly opening door.

A thin figure emerged from behind the door.

Looking closely, the person who came out was a girl so thin she no longer looked human, making it impossible to determine her age.

Her cheeks were deeply sunken, her eyes bulging outward, as if all the flesh had disappeared from her face.

She licked her cracked lips and looked curiously at the group.

After a brief moment of daze, she seemed to realize something and quickly tidied her dirty, tattered clothes, saying in a hoarse voice: "Welcome..."

Welcome...?

Officer Li carefully processed the meaning of this sentence and seemed to understand.

"Are you... the clerk?"

The girl nodded: "Yes."

No one spoke further, because this situation seemed unreasonable.

Not to mention why there were other humans here, but even if she really was a 'clerk', why would she be working in a completely dilapidated convenience store?

Seeing that no one moved, the clerk could only tentatively say: "Please browse freely."

Although that's what she said, how could there be any space for 'browsing' here?

There were almost no products on the shelves, and the few items that remained were rotten and covered in filth.

The clerk's eyes were vacant, staring fixedly at the group.

This gaze made some of the women feel afraid.

"Do you have needles and thread?" Qi Xia asked the clerk without changing his expression.

"Needles... thread?" The clerk's lifeless eyes moved slightly, then she extended her hand, simulating the action of threading a needle. "Do you mean... this kind of needle and thread?"

Only then did everyone notice that her hands were covered with dried, dark bloodstains, which was horrifying.

Qi Xia took another step forward and said: "Yes, that kind of needle and thread. Do you sell it?"

"Liar, you..." Before meeting Qi Xia, Qiao Jiajin considered himself the bravest person in the world, but now even he didn't dare to speak to this woman. "Can't you see this woman isn't normal?"

"So what if I can tell?" Qi Xia said calmly. "Our situation couldn't get any worse than it is now."

The female clerk stared blankly for a moment, then suddenly opened the counter partition and rushed out.

Only then did everyone see her full appearance.

She was wearing a dirty, oversized white shirt that hung on her as awkwardly as clothes on a hanger.

Something was smeared on her shirt that felt like oil, or perhaps blood.

The shirt almost reached her knees, and she seemed to be wearing no pants, with dried bloodstains all over her thighs.

Qi Xia frowned slightly, wanting to take a step back, but the female clerk suddenly grabbed his wrist.

He felt as if his wrist was entangled by an old vine, dry and painful.

"I have them here!!" The female clerk opened her mouth, revealing yellow teeth. "I have 'needles and thread'! Come with me!"

She kept pointing toward the 'employee break room', as if wanting Qi Xia to follow her inside.

Everyone was truly frightened by her. Judging by this woman's current behavior, following her inside didn't seem like a good idea.

"Forget it... we're not buying anything!" Qiao Jiajin went forward, trying to pull the woman's hand away. "Let go first."

But the female clerk seemed not to hear, pulling Qi Xia along while moving her feet, showing a happy smile.

"There are 'needles and thread' in this room! Come on!"

Her strength was even greater than that of Qiao Jiajin and Qi Xia combined.

"Hey!! Come and help!" Qiao Jiajin shouted back.

Officer Li and Dr. Zhao came to their senses and rushed forward.

The female clerk involuntarily quickened her pace.

Qi Xia only felt a huge force dragging him, completely unable to break free.

The two of them weren't far from the employee break room to begin with, and now after six or seven steps, they were already through the door.

Dr. Zhao and Officer Li were pulling Qi Xia outward, but unexpectedly, the female clerk suddenly let go.

"Ah!"

With a cry of surprise, several people almost fell over.

After steadying themselves, they saw that the female clerk wasn't paying attention to them, but instead turned around and began rummaging through cabinets and drawers in the room, searching for something.

The four men also looked around the room, still shaken.

This place was slightly cleaner than outside. In a corner, there was a folding bed with yellowed bedding.

On it was a large pool of bloodstains that looked relatively fresh.

In another corner, a simple stove held a rusty iron pot, in which something was bubbling and cooking.
