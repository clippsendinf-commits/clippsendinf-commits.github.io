# Chapter 2: The Liar

The woman's scream ceased, and everyone's thoughts came to an abrupt halt.

The men who had been shouting and cursing moments ago now fell silent.

This was no longer a matter of "illegality" â€“ the strange figure before them would actually kill people.

After more than a minute of complete silence, the goat head nodded slightly. "Very good, nine of you. It seems you've all quieted down."

The participants' expressions changed, but none dared to speak. Just as he had said, there were now truly "nine" of them.

Qi Xia extended a trembling hand, removing a pinkish-yellow object from his face.

The shattered piece of brain, still warm, was pulsing slightly, but after a few seconds, it lost its vitality like a deflated balloon.

"Now, allow me to introduce myself..." The goat head raised his blood-soaked finger, pointing to his mask. "I am the 'Human Goat,' and you are the 'Participants.'"

The participants were startled, then somewhat confused. "Human Goat," "Participants"?

"I've gathered you all here to participate in a game, to ultimately create a 'god,'" the goat head said in a flat tone.

These two consecutive statements made everyone frown.

After these few minutes together, the participants had generally understood that the man before them was insane, but this madman claimed he wanted to create a "god"?

"Create... what kind of god?" a muscular young man asked nervously.

"A god like 'NÃ¼wa'!" the goat head said, gesturing wildly. He exuded a gamey smell, his voice carrying a ferocious quality. "How wonderful! You will witness history with us. NÃ¼wa once created humanity, but turned into a rainbow while mending the sky... We cannot lose NÃ¼wa, so we must create a new NÃ¼wa! A great task awaits the 'god'!"

His voice gradually rose, as if he had been injected with adrenaline.

"NÃ¼wa..." The muscular young man frowned, feeling that this matter was too difficult to accept. He paused, then asked, "Are you some kind of religious group?"

"Religion?" The goat head paused slightly, turning to the young man. "We are far more magnificent than 'religion.' We have a 'world'!"

Hearing this, everyone fell silent again.

The muscular man's question was very targeted. The goat-headed man's actions were no different from a cult, but most cults tended to fabricate a new god rather than use a heroic figure like NÃ¼wa.

"In that case..." the muscular man continued, "what do you want us to 'participate' in here?"

"I've already said, just a game." The goat head answered without hesitation. "If you win, one of you will become a 'god'."

"Damn it all..." The tattooed man seemed to have calmed down, cursing as he spoke. "Is this some kind of 'Investiture of the Gods'? What if we can't win?"

"If you can't win..." the goat head looked at the blood on his hands, saying with some disappointment, "It would be such a pity if you can't win..."

Although he didn't say it directly, everyone understood his meaning.

If you can't win, you die.

Among the options he gave, there was no path to "get out alive."

Either become his so-called "god," or die here like the young man whose head had exploded.

"If everyone understands... then this 'game' officially begins. This game is called 'The Liar.'" The goat head slowly pulled out a stack of papers from his pocket, then casually walked to each person, placing one down.

He then took out several pens and distributed them to everyone.

There was quite a bit of blood on the table. When each white paper landed on the table, it was stained with red. When they turned the paper over and wiped it with their hands, the blood red spread like paint, making the white paper even redder.

"Next, I want each of you to tell a story about what happened last before you came here," the goat head continued. "But be aware that among all the storytellers, one person is lying. After all nine have finished their stories, you will begin voting. If all eight people correctly identify the 'Liar,' the liar is eliminated, and everyone else survives. If even one person votes incorrectly, the liar survives, and everyone else is eliminated."

"The Liar...?"

The participants were somewhat confused. Would someone really lie at this critical moment between life and death?

"Wait, can we discuss 'tactics'?" the muscular man suddenly asked.

"As you wish." The goat head nodded. "Before the game begins, you have one minute to discuss tactics among yourselves. Do you want to use it now... or later?"

"I want to use it now," the muscular man answered without hesitation.

"Please do."

The goat head took a step back, moving away from the table.

The muscular man licked his lips, then looked around at everyone, his gaze carefully avoiding the headless corpse slumped over the table. "I don't know who among you plans to lie later, but this 'rule' sounds too arbitrary. If just one person votes wrong, we all die. Even if we choose correctly, the liar will die. This way, someone will die regardless. Now I've thought of a way for everyone to survive..."

Hearing this, everyone looked at the muscular man.

Everyone could survive? Was that possible?

"That is, none of us will lie," the muscular man announced before anyone could fully process it. "All nine of us will tell the truth, and finally write 'No one is lying' on this paper. This way, we don't violate the rules, and we can all survive."
