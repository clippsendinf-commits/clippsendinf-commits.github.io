# Chapter 29: The Mystery

Officer Li didn't look at Qiao Jiajin, but instead asked Qi Xia: "I do have something to ask about Han Yimo... You seemed to have something left unsaid earlier. What does Han Yimo's death represent? And what does that sword mean?"

Qi Xia narrowed his eyes, carefully sizing up Officer Li: "Officer, you're skilled in criminal investigation, while I'm skilled in deception. Isn't it strange that you're asking me for advice on this case?"

Officer Li helplessly lowered his head and said: "We've already come to this hellish place. How could 'criminal investigation' possibly be of any use now?"

After hearing this, Qi Xia remained silent for a moment before deciding to tell him what he had deduced: "Officer, all I can say is... Han Yimo might have recognized that sword."

"Recognized?" Officer Li frowned, then nodded thoughtfully, "You mean he had seen that sword before?"

"These aren't questions you need to consider right now," Qi Xia said. "You should be more concerned about your own situation."

"What do you mean?"

Qi Xia sighed and was about to turn away when Officer Li grabbed his arm.

"Don't go. What exactly is my 'situation'?"

Lin Qin covered her mouth and nose, leaned close to Officer Li's ear, and whispered: "Officer, since Qi Xia is unwilling to say, I can tell you instead. There are two things you need to be careful about."

"Two things?"

"That's right. First, the only one here who could easily lift that giant sword is the crazed female shop assistant. Her strength is immense. In other words, if Han Yimo was indeed murdered, then the shop assistant is the prime suspect. You should leave this place as soon as possible."

Officer Li nodded with a heavy expression and asked: "What's the second thing?"

"Second, your 'teammates' don't seem very trustworthy."

Officer Li's lips moved slightly, as if something had occurred to him.

The ones standing on his side now included Xiao Ran, the kindergarten teacher who was easily swayed by emotions and didn't seem very intelligent; Zhang Chenze, the lawyer who was indifferent to everything and only considered pros and cons; and Doctor Zhao, who had previously confronted him and was somewhat self-centered.

Could this group of four truly trust each other when faced with life-threatening challenges?

Officer Li struggled with his thoughts for a long time before finally saying: "Qi Xia, regardless, I'll use the convenience store as a base and explore the nearby areas. If you have any information... you can come find me to trade."

Qi Xia neither agreed nor refused, simply gave him a faint glance before turning and walking away.

The remaining few didn't know what to say and followed him.

Officer Li stared at the backs of the four people for a while, then returned to the convenience store with Doctor Zhao and Xiao Ran.

He knew perfectly well that the four people outside would be more reliable in critical moments, but they were going to collect 'Dao'â€”in other words, they were looking for death.

Following them wasn't safe either.

If he wanted to survive smoothly now, he could only find a stronghold first and then plan his next move carefully.

...

Qi Xia led the group forward, and soon they arrived at the square where they had appeared yesterday.

He wanted to confirm something here.

That was the huge bell sound he had heard in the morning.

Just like yesterday, there was a giant electronic display screen in the center, with a bronze bell hanging above it.

When Han Yimo was stabbed, the giant bell rang.

Lin Qin blinked and said: "I seem to have heard the bell several times..."

"Several times?" Qiao Jiajin paused and asked, "When?"

Lin Qin's pupils shifted slightly as she recalled: "Do you remember... the man whose head was smashed by the 'Human Goat' when we first woke up in the room? When he died, there seemed to be a bell ringing too."

Tian Tian seemed to understand something: "Could it be... the bell rings every time someone dies?"

Everyone nodded, feeling this guess was probably correct. The bronze bell before them seemed like a death knell, announcing the number of deaths to everyone.

"No," Qi Xia shook his head. "The corridor we've been through has at least a thousand rooms. While we were experiencing the 'game,' people were dying in various rooms. If this thing was a death knell, we wouldn't have heard the bell only twice."

"This..." Tian Tian felt Qi Xia made sense, but if so, what were the conditions for the giant bell to ring?

"Huh?" Lin Qin looked up at the display screen and found it completely empty. "I remember there was a line of text on it yesterday."

Everyone looked up and indeed, the text had disappeared.

"It was something about 'echo'..." Qiao Jiajin said, rubbing his chin. "I echoed 'Beckoning Disaster'?"

"I heard the echo of 'Beckoning Disaster'," Qi Xia said.

"Oh, right..." Qiao Jiajin nodded. "What does that mean?"

Qi Xia shook his head.

This wasn't something that could be understood through 'guessing.' They knew too little about this city.

What is Beckoning Disaster? What is an echo? And who is 'I'?

"Let's go check somewhere else."

Qi Xia turned around, but just as he was about to leave, he suddenly froze.

Before his eyes was a withered face with a smile.

This face had appeared behind him at some point and was now staring directly at him.

Qi Xia's pupils contracted as he quickly took two steps back.

The other three were also startled. Before them was a withered old man, standing on tiptoe, his body bent like a dead tree.

"I've thought of it..." the old man smiled slightly, revealing his single remaining tooth. "I've thought of the answer to your question!"

Qi Xia felt a chill down his spine as the old man stared at him: "Are you talking to me?"

The old man licked his cracked lips: "Young man, I know the answer now! It's 'betting your life'! As long as you're willing to bet your life, everything will be easy!"

He extended a hand with dirty fingernails, reaching for Qi Xia.

"We're so close to getting out of here! As long as you're willing to bet your life..."

Qi Xia frowned and took a few more steps back. Although he couldn't understand what the old man was saying, the fact that he kept asking for his life was too eerie.

"Hey! Old man, who are you?" Qiao Jiajin asked suspiciously. "Have you met Qi Xia before?"

The old man's expression changed as he turned to look at Qiao Jiajin.

He opened his mouth with a complex expression, then asked: "You don't recognize me?"

"Why should I recognize you?"

The atmosphere fell silent for a moment. The old man's cloudy eyes kept flashing, and after a long time, he finally realized something: "So that's how it is... You... you've already met the 'Sky Dragon'..."

"Sky Dragon?" The four people looked at each other in confusion.

"There's no hope..." the old man shook his head, slowly turning his back to them. "We can't defeat him... We'll be lost here forever... No wonder the 'Zodiacs' have returned again..."

He muttered to himself as he walked away, his back looking extremely desolate.
