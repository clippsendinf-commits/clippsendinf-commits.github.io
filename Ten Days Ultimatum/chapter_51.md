# Chapter 51: Xiao Xiao

The group ate about half of the bear meat, then drank all the broth.

It had to be said, the broth tasted better than the bear meat itself.

Or perhaps it was because everyone was so thirsty that anything they drank tasted sweet.

"Let's leave the rest of the bear meat here," Qi Xia said, stretching his limbs. "If we're still alive tonight, we can have another meal."

Xiao Xiao suddenly spoke up. "I want another bowl."

After saying this, she took her bowl and added more bear meat to it.

"Suit yourself," Qi Xia said as he slowly stood up and looked at the sky. It appeared to be afternoon.

"We need to hurry," Qi Xia said. "The four of us only won ninety-five 'Dao.' That's far from enough progress. Today's goal is three hundred sixty."

"You're right," Qiao Jiajin also stood up. "Let's go."

Tian Tian and Lin Qin packed their things and dusted themselves off. When they turned around, they saw that Xiao Xiao still hadn't stood up. She continued eating the meat in her bowl as if she hadn't heard anything.

"Sister Xiao Xiao, aren't you leaving?" Tian Tian asked.

Xiao Xiao tossed a large piece of fatty meat into her mouth, licked her fingers, but still didn't answer.

"Just ignore her," Qi Xia said, knowing this woman had ulterior motives. It would be better for everyone to part ways sooner. "Let's go."

Qiao Jiajin nodded and turned to walk toward Qi Xia.

Just then, a huge bell rang in the distance.

DONG!!!

Everyone looked confused.

Just as Qi Xia was about to say something, he suddenly saw a "wall" flying toward his face.

"What?"

Before Qi Xia could react, he crashed heavily into that wall.

After several seconds, he realized what was happening.

It wasn't a "flying wall" at allâ€”he had fallen face-down onto the floor.

He had never experienced such a strange sensation, as if all his senses were completely confused.

Qi Xia struggled to turn his head and found that Qiao Jiajin, Lin Qin, and Tian Tian were also lying sprawled on the ground. Their eyes were closed, as if they had lost consciousness.

"What is this..."

Qi Xia felt the situation was extremely bizarre. He shook his head in disbelief. He tried to extend his left hand, but his right hand came out instead.

He wanted to stand up, but fell to the ground again.

The feeling was much like being drunk, yet his mind was surprisingly clear.

Xiao Xiao stared at her bowl, eating the remaining meat in large bites, as if she hadn't seen anything.

"What... did you do?" Qi Xia stared at Xiao Xiao. "Did you poison us?"

Although he asked this, Qi Xia still felt some doubt.

Xiao Xiao had eaten more of the bear meat than anyone else. If it was really poisoned, why was she unaffected?

"Qi Xia, listen, the bell rang," Xiao Xiao said calmly.

"The bell rang... what does that mean?"

"It means... I want to negotiate with you," Xiao Xiao said as she put down her empty bowl and stood up.

"Negotiate...?" Qi Xia looked at the slightly overweight woman before him in disbelief. He had originally thought this woman was merely scheming, but now she seemed far more terrifying than he had imagined.

The other party now had complete control, and he had no right to refuse.

"What kind of terms do you want to negotiate?" Qi Xia asked.

"Stop collecting 'Dao'," Xiao Xiao said. "Live peacefully here."

"What...?"

Qi Xia had considered many possibilities, but never this situation.

The other party wasn't here for the 'Dao'?

"You want me to live peacefully here?!" Qi Xia tried to get up but found his limbs completely unresponsive. He could only lie on the ground and say viciously, "Why the hell would I want to live here?!"

Xiao Xiao wiped the grease from her hands on her pants, then walked over to the four people and took all the 'Dao' from their waists.

Finally, she squatted beside Qi Xia and said expressionlessly, "Because you're too strong. You have a chance to collect enough 'Dao'."

"Isn't that a good thing..." Qi Xia said through gritted teeth. "I'll solve the mystery of this damned place and take everyone out."

"No, I can't let that happen," Xiao Xiao shook her head calmly. "I won't allow anyone to succeed in collecting them. I want to protect this place. If you continue to be obsessed, I'll make you regret it."

"I see..." Qi Xia snorted. "You look like a normal person, but you're actually crazy... You want me to be like those walking corpses, living here forever? Did no one tell you this damned place only has ten days left? It's going to be annihilated!"

"This place is going to be annihilated?" Xiao Xiao nodded, seemingly not surprised by this answer. "Then let me rephrase. I want you to wait quietly for the annihilation in the next few days, without collecting any more 'Dao'."

"You... you're crazy..." Qi Xia said slowly. "If I don't comply, what will you do? Kill me?"

"Perhaps."

"You won't."

"Oh? Why not?"

"Because you have the chance to kill me right now," Qi Xia said. "You could have killed me directly, but you wanted to 'negotiate' with me instead. Why?"

Xiao Xiao frowned at this, turned around to move the pot, and threw all the 'Dao' into the stove fire.

"Hey!!" Qi Xia shouted. "What's wrong with you?!"

As the fire crackled, all the 'Dao' that Qi Xia and the others had risked their lives for turned to ash.

Xiao Xiao turned back at this moment, looking at Qi Xia with a sad expression. "I'm not killing you because I hope you'll join us someday."

Qi Xia felt he couldn't communicate with this woman named Xiao Xiao at all. "Can't you understand? There are only ten days left! After ten days, everything will disappear. What do you mean by 'join us someday'?"

After a pause, he asked, "And who are 'you'?"

"Qi Xia," Xiao Xiao said. "You'll understand everything in ten days. This place, these people..."

She pointed to the three people lying on the ground and said to Qi Xia, "They're not important. Their deaths mean nothing. But you're different. You need to live here."

"Don't be ridiculous," Qi Xia said. "How would you know whether they're important to me or not?"

"I..." Xiao Xiao paused for a moment, as if remembering something, then said to Qi Xia, "I can prove to you that their deaths mean nothing."

"You... what are you going to do?"

After saying this, Xiao Xiao took off her shirt, revealing a sports vest underneath.

Only then did Qi Xia realize that the woman before him wasn't "slightly overweight" at allâ€”her muscle content far exceeded Qiao Jiajin's. Her abdominal muscles were clearly defined, and her arms were like stone pillars.

When they first met this woman, they noticed her large frame and broad shoulders, naturally assuming she was obese.

Although her face was thin, no one could have imagined that beneath her loose T-shirt was a body of strong muscles.
