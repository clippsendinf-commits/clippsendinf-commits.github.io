# Chapter 18: The Yes or No Questions

Nine people hung like ceiling lamps, swinging back and forth under the pull of a single rope.

Lin Qin looked down, and her heart sank.

Below them was a void about ten meters deep.

If they hadn't grabbed the rope, they would have surely fallen to their deaths by now.

"Hey, writer, hold on tight!" Qiao Jiajin noticed Han Yimo continuously sliding down and grew anxious, "Why are you so weak at a critical moment?"

"I..." Han Yimo's face was etched with strain, but his left hand was still loosening.

Qiao Jiajin, being close to Han Yimo, immediately let go with one hand and grabbed his rope, wrapping it around Han Yimo's waist. But with only one hand, he couldn't tie it tightly no matter how he tried.

Officer Li saw this and reached out to help. Together, using one hand each, they tied the end of Han Yimo's rope around his waist.

Just as everyone was about to breathe a sigh of relief, they heard another muffled groan.

Turning their heads, Tian Tian couldn't help but cry out. Only then did everyone remember that her hand was also injured.

But this girl seemed incredibly resilient, enduring until her blood had soaked the rope before letting out a muffled groan.

Her right hand released, leaving only her left hand gripping the rope. But a girl's strength is naturally less, and supporting her entire body weight with one hand was exceptionally difficult. She suddenly slid downward.

Qi Xia's expression changed, and he immediately reached out to grab her injured wrist.

With just that brief touch, he discovered Tian Tian's thin body was trembling slightly, and her wrist was ice-cold.

"Hey, scammer, you're not so bad after all." Qiao Jiajin remarked.

Qi Xia sighed helplessly and said, "I just don't want to see another corpse. Don't read too much into it."

Time passed minute by minute, and everyone's arms began to ache.

Hanging for such a long time wasn't easy for anyone. Even Officer Li's forehead began to sweat.

"How long do we have to hang like this?" Lin Qin asked Qi Xia beside her.

"I don't know," Qi Xia replied in a low voice.

He knew there was no prompt for "the next game" anymore, but they still couldn't see any hope.

If the organizers were cruel enough, they could just leave them hanging until they diedâ€”it would only be a matter of time.

But...

Was there really no prompt for the next game?

Qi Xia felt uneasy.

Could there be some hidden prompt in a place they couldn't see?

He looked down at the ground below. If there was any prompt, it must be somewhere down there.

"Hmm?"

As he scanned the area, he noticed that due to the floor collapse, new walls had appeared at the bottom. In the corner of the lowest wall, there seemed to be a door.

But that door was completely out of reach for everyone.

They were still about ten meters from the bottom floor. Jumping from this height would be impossible to survive unharmed.

Lin Qin followed Qi Xia's gaze for a while and also noticed the problem.

"Is that a door?"

Hearing this, everyone looked down and indeed saw the old wooden door at the bottom.

Just as everyone was staring in despair, the door slowly opened.

A black figure walked out from the darkness. Qi Xia looked closelyâ€”this person was also wearing a black suit, but his mask was completely different from the Sheep-Headed Man's.

He was wearing a huge, dark green snake head.

"Long time no see, everyone. I am 'Human Snake.'" He spoke slowly.

"Human Snake my ass!" Qiao Jiajin shouted, "After sheep and dog, now it's snake? Do you believe I'll kill you right now?"

"Please don't get excited." Human Snake's voice was calm. He looked up at everyone and then said, "You are now undergoing the final test. I have a lever beside me. If I pull it, you will descend slowly, and no one will get hurt."

Everyone looked toward where the voice came from. Sure enough, beside the wooden door was an inconspicuous lever that no one had noticed earlier due to the dim lighting.

"Then... can you pull it down now?" Xiao Ran asked timidly.

"I..." Human Snake smiled imperceptibly and said, "I'll play a game with you. Whether you can survive depends on your performance."

"Another game..." Doctor Zhao's hair was disheveled. He gritted his teeth as if he wanted to eat someone.

"Listen carefully, everyone. This game is called 'Yes or No.'" Human Snake stepped forward slightly and said to the people hanging and swaying above, "Next, all of you can ask me a total of three questions, and my answers will only be 'yes' or 'no.' Note that I will not lie. After the three questions are asked, if I agree to save you, I will pull the lever. If I don't agree, I will lock this door and leave you to your fate."

Qi Xia frowned.

Three questions?

Only 'yes' or 'no' answers?

This game was too tricky.

No matter what, their goal was to get this Snake-Headed Man to let them down, so they had to focus their questions around this topic. But would he agree?

While everyone was thinking, the kindergarten teacher Xiao Ran decisively spoke up: "Hey, can you let us down?!"

"No!" Qi Xia was startled and quickly reached out to cover Xiao Ran's mouth, but the girl spoke too quickly, and the question had already reached Human Snake's ears clearly.

Human Snake sneered and said, "No."

"Hey! Miss?!" Qiao Jiajin shouted, "We only have three questions, don't mess this up!"

"I..."

Xiao Ran lowered her head in distress, her expression filled with sadness.
