# Chapter 13 A Rain

Qi Xia said while turning the table with effort: "Ningxia and Shandong can form a horizontal line."

"Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, and Yunnan can form a 'piÄ›' (left-falling stroke)."

"And Guangxi, Guangdong, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu can form a square, which is exactly the character 'right'."

"No matter where Han Yimo's hometown is, as long as it's any of Guangxi or Taiwan, it will form a 'kÇ’u' (mouth) character, so the answer was determined from the beginning."

Everyone accelerated their movements while casting strange glances.

Qi Xia's thinking was too unconventional, but he had solved the puzzle twice in a row, which made everyone start to have suspicions.

Qi Xia himself understood this, so he said to everyone: "Don't misunderstand. If the next game is about abandoning you all to save myself, I willæ¯«ä¸çŠ¹è±«åœ° let myself live."

Hearing him say this, everyone could only fall silent, gritting their teeth as they turned the table.

Nine people sat around the table, continuously pushing it to the right.

"How many rounds has it been?" Qiao Jiajin asked.

"Twenty-six rounds," Lin Qin answered.

"You can even count that?" Qiao Jiajin blinked, "This table looks the same."

"I counted by the bloodstains on the table," Lin Qin said seriously, "Counting is very important for us psychological counselors."

Qi Xia frowned: "Not even thirty rounds yet, we need to hurry up."

Everyone then quieted down, accelerating their movements.

But the table became harder to move as time went on, as if the internal chain was tightening more and more.

"Damn it, what's going on?" Qiao Jiajin said through gritted teeth, "This is too heavy."

"Keep going... maybe it's really connected to the door!" Tian Tian said with a grimace.

Her words gave everyone a glimmer of hope in their despair.

The door.

Since this room could conjure holes out of thin air, why couldn't it conjure a door?

Everyone's arms were aching, but they continued to rotate the table round after round.

"Don't give up! Only five rounds left!" Lin Qin shouted loudly.

At this moment, everyone was gritting their teeth and exerting force, not daring to slack off.

Click, clack.

As the last round ended, the table was clearly embedded into something.

Everyone finally breathed a sigh of relief as the soreness in their arms gradually emerged.

At this moment, there were only three minutes left until 1:15.

"Where's the door?!" Qiao Jiajin shouted anxiously.

The surrounding walls showed no change, and the cold glint of the harpoons could still be seen in the dark void.

"Damn it! There's no door!" Qiao Jiajin's voice carried a hint of despair.

"We were wrong! We guessed wrong!" Xiao Ran screamed, "Should we have turned left?! We shouldn't have trusted that liar! We're all going to die here!!"

Qi Xia frowned slightly...

Wrong?

Before everyone could react, the clock in the center of the table suddenly changed.

It trembled slightly, then shot out eight laser beams.

The eight laser beams emitted from the clock, gradually moving to the edge of the table and stopping.

Under everyone's bewildered gaze, the clock precisely divided the table into nine equal-sized sectors like a pizza.

Crash!

With a loud noise, the table shattered into pieces.

The clock in the center now stood only on a small wooden stake.

Time was too tight, and everyone was flustered.

"What is this?" Han Yimo exclaimed, "Why did the table break?"

Police Officer Li discovered that each sector of the tabletop actually had handles on the back. His years of professional experience made him instantly understand something.

"They're shields!"

He picked up a sector of the tabletop and held it in front of himself.

"We can use these shields to block the harpoons!"

Hearing this, everyone raised their own table sectors.

But after just a dozen seconds, everyone discovered a problem.

"How do we block them?!" Lawyer Zhang Chenze rarely showed a hint of panic, "If there are harpoons from all four directions, we can only block one direction."

"We need to cooperate," Qi Xia said as he came to his senses, "We'll form a circle and block each other's backs."

Everyone quickly adjusted their formation after hearing this and waited quietly.

At this moment, the only sound was everyone's breathing.

Nine strangers had now become teammates, each indispensable.

Qi Xia happened to glance back at the writer Han Yimo, finding his face covered in fine sweat, his whole body trembling, looking exceptionally nervous.

At this moment, another bell rang from a distant place outside the room.

"Are you okay?" Qi Xia asked.

"N-nothing..." Han Yimo shook his head.

"Hey! Dr. Zhao, turn your tabletop over!" Zhang Chenze suddenly said.

"Why?" Dr. Zhao looked at the tabletop in his hand, with the pointed end down and the wide end up.

"You can't block my legs like this!" Zhang Chenze said nervously, "I'll be hit!"

"If I turn it over, I can't block my head!" Dr. Zhao retorted, "Is the head more important or the legs?"

After hearing the argument between the two, some people felt that Dr. Zhao's words made sense, and actually turned their sectors around.

Pointed end down, wide end up.

This created a bizarre situation.

The harpoons flying from all directions would only be blocked in the upper part, and everyone's legs would be injured.
