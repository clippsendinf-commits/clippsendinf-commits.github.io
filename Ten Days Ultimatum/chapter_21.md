# Chapter 21: The Hinterland

"Of course... hehe, of course I know what I'm talking about." The Human Dragon slowly took a step forward and said to the group, "Countless people have walked out of this door, and I've said these words to every single one of them."

"Countless people..."

The group froze for a moment. Officer Li said viciously, "What exactly are you things? How many people have you captured?"

"'Captured'?" The Human Dragon tilted his head, revealing a pair of murky eyes from the hollows of his mask. He stared coldly at Officer Li and smiled, "Are you mistaken? Did we really 'capture' you?"

"Are you saying we weren't?!" Officer Li said through gritted teeth, "Don't tell me we came here willingly!"

Lin Qin sighed and said to Qi Xia and Officer Li, "You both know they're mad, so don't try to argue with them. Let's get out of here quickly."

Her words brought the group back to their senses. These people wearing animal masks weren't normal to begin with, and the one before them, with his mask stitched together from various animal heads, was even crazier.

If they followed the madman's line of thinking, they would go mad soon enough.

The group walked around the Human Dragon and headed toward the exit behind him.

"Remember, without three thousand six hundred 'Dao,' no one can get out." The Human Dragon reminded them in a low voice.

As if possessed, Qi Xia turned his head and asked him, "How do we obtain 'Dao'?"

"Damn it, why are you talking to him?" Qiao Jiajin pushed Qi Xia irritably, "You're really going to look for those golden beads?"

"Regardless, I must get out of here." There was a determined look in Qi Xia's eyes, "Someone is waiting for me."

The Human Dragon nodded slightly and said, "Through the 'games' you've experienced. Different games can yield different 'Dao'."

Qi Xia's expression darkened. He looked down at the golden bead in his hand, "You mean... we have to voluntarily participate in games to obtain 'Dao'?"

"Hehe, that's right. Take them, take them." The Human Dragon waved his dirty hands continuously, "You must leave this place."

Qi Xia looked at the beads in his hand, lost in thought.

The others didn't know how to persuade him, so they walked out of the door one after another.

A gentle breeze brushed against their faces, carrying that indescribable heavy scent.

The few people present slowly opened their eyes, but there was no joy of being reborn.

Because before them lay a dead city that looked like ruins.

In the dark red sky hung a sun the color of earth. Black threads crisscrossed the surface of the sun, spreading inward.

Beneath this grotesque sky, what met their eyes was a ruined city.

It appeared to be the prosperous area of a small town, as if it had been bombed once and then burned to ashes.

The fire had raged for days and nights without being extinguished, finally leaving it in this state.

Most of the buildings were damaged, with cracked walls. Countless dark red plants covered the walls.

Officer Li swallowed and asked, "Hey, Human Dragon, what kind of hellish place have you brought us to..."

He turned his head, but his words trailed off as his mouth slowly widened.

Following his voice, the others also looked back.

Behind them, there were no buildings at all, but an empty square.

At this moment, the nine of them stood alone in the center of the square, as if they had fallen from the sky.

"How did we get here?"

"Where's the door we came out of?! Where's the Human Dragon?!"

Unfortunately, there was no one here who could answer their questions.

In the very center of the square stood a particularly conspicuous large electronic display screen, which looked quite old, with even the edges somewhat rusted.

On the screen at this moment was a sentence that baffled everyone:

"I heard the echo of 'Beckoning Disaster'."

"Beckoning Disaster? What the hell is that?" Qiao Jiajin read the sentence twice but still didn't understand.

Qi Xia noticed that above the electronic display stood a huge, mottled bronze bell.

Such an ancient object placed together with an electronic display looked very disharmonious.

After a long while, the writer Han Yimo slowly raised his head and said in a low voice, "So we really are dead... this is the underworld, right?"

Before seeing this scene, he had still held a glimmer of hope.

Perhaps they hadn't died, but had been captured here just before death.

But how could one explain this clearly abnormal world?

"I don't know if we're dead or not, I only know that if I don't treat your wound soon, you'll really die." Dr. Zhao summoned his strength and supported Han Yimo's arm.

This sentence also slowly pulled the group back from their daze.

Regardless, they seemed to be 'alive' now, and since they seemed to be alive, they couldn't give up.

"There seems to be a convenience store over there." Lin Qin pointed into the distance, "Although it looks severely damaged, I wonder if there might be thread and gauze inside?"

Without another word, Qiao Jiajin supported Han Yimo's other arm and said with a bitter smile:

"Let's go check. It would be even better if there's something to eat."

The group slowly moved forward.

The scenery here constantly revealed a strange atmosphere, making everyone feel uneasy.

The convenience store was in the middle of a road. The glass at the entrance was completely shattered, and the sign had collapsed halfway.

Just as the group was about to reach the entrance, they slowly stopped.

Across from the convenience store was a restaurant, where a figure stood at the entrance.

He wore an ox head mask and a black suit, with his hands behind his back, like a statue.
