# Chapter 25: Divergence Point

Zhang Chenze's eyes widened, unable to speak a word. She could only instinctively step backward.

"What's wrong?" Qiao Jiajin, whose view was blocked by Zhang Chenze, didn't know what was happening.

Everyone watched as the proud lawyer retreated several steps before plopping down onto the filthy ground.

"You... you..." Zhang Chenze pointed a trembling finger at the female shopkeeper.

The others followed her gaze and saw that in the shopkeeper's outstretched palm lay a small piece of an armâ€”tiny, clearly not belonging to an adult. Moreover, the fingers were distinctly formed, definitely not from any animal.

It seemed the shopkeeper had indeed cooked a baby.

The baby's arm was emitting an enticing aroma at this moment.

Qi Xia witnessed this scene, and connecting it with the strange environment of the room, instantly understood something.

"So this is... the little piglet?" Qi Xia asked tentatively.

"That's right." The shopkeeper nodded. "Aren't you going to eat?"

Qi Xia's expression darkened as he asked again, "You said if we sleep with you, you could eat the little piglet. This is what you meant by 'little piglet'?!"

"Mm." The shopkeeper stared blankly at Qi Xia. "Little piglets are delicious."

The smell of blood was strong in the room. There were bloodstains on the shopkeeper's thighs and on the bed. If Qi Xia guessed correctly, this woman had given birth not long ago, then cooked the child.

She wanted men to sleep with her just so she could eat the child.

"I can only eat a little piglet about once a year..." The shopkeeper smiled, revealing yellowed teeth. "I just wanted to ask if any of you would sleep with me? I can trade you for pig's feet..."

"We... we don't eat..." Officer Li shook his head.

"Since you don't eat... then never mind..." She fumbled for a moment, stuffing the boiled baby's arm into her clothes pocket, then wiped the grease from her hands.

Zhang Chenze saw how the jacket she had draped over the shopkeeper was now stained and couldn't find words to say.

She had never imagined that cooking human flesh would produce so much grease.

Tian Tian slowly walked to the shopkeeper's side and said to her with a complicated expression, "Miss, what you ate wasn't a little piglet. It was a child..."

"A child?" The shopkeeper's lifeless eyes rolled. "That was a little piglet. It suddenly darted out and bumped into me, hurting me."

Everyone looked at each other, at a loss for words.

"Heh... I'm hungry again." The shopkeeper raised her eyebrows. "I'm going to drink some pork soup. It's so nice to be full."

With that, she turned and walked back into the employee break room. Before closing the door, she seemed to remember something and said with a silly smile to the group, "Please help yourselves!"

Then she slammed the door shut.

The group fell silent for a long time, the atmosphere extremely oppressive.

Finally, it was Qi Xia who broke the silence.

"Everyone, even if this wretched place isn't destroyed in ten days, we still can't return to the real world." Qi Xia ran a hand over his forehead. "If we have to stay here forever, we'll eventually go crazy just like her."

This time, Officer Li didn't object to Qi Xia.

He hesitated too. In this clearly abnormal city, under this dark red sky and yellow sun, how long could humans maintain their sanity?

From inside the room came the sound of kitchenware clashing. It seemed the shopkeeper had served herself another bowl of delicacy and was now feasting heartily.

Separated by just a door, a woman was eating her own newborn child.

Everything about this place was too abnormal.

"I want to go out and see." Qi Xia said. "Aren't you curious? What kind of place is this? Who are these people? Does the city have an edge? What's outside? How did we get here, and how do we get out?"

Rather than "curiosity," the expressions on everyone's faces looked more like fear.

"I just feel that there's danger everywhere..." Xiao Ran shook her head and said to Qi Xia, "Rather than go out and participate in those 'games,' I'd rather find a safe place to stay."

"Miss, there's no food or water here." Qiao Jiajin patted his stomach. "If we want to survive, we can't really eat that little piglet, can we?"

His position was clear. Rather than stay here and wait to die, he also wanted to go out and explore.

At this point, the nine people seemed to be divided into two groupsâ€”some wanted to leave, others wanted to stay.

Dr. Zhao looked at Han Yimo beside him and said, "Going out to see is fine, but the injured can't go. He's destined to stay here. As a doctor, I should stay to take care of him."

"Then I'll stay with you..." Xiao Ran said softly.

"Are you trying to die?" Qiao Jiajin shook his head. "A patient, a weak girl, plus a doctorâ€”do you three plan to live here?"

"I'll stay too." Officer Li suddenly spoke up.

Dr. Zhao and the other two turned to look at him, knowing that with the physically strong Officer Li also staying, they would naturally be safer.

Officer Li nodded to Dr. Zhao and said, "This hoodlum is right. It's too dangerous for you three to be here alone. Not to mention those animal masks, even if that woman inside goes crazy, you won't be able to handle it."

Now the number of people choosing to stay had reached four. Everyone's gaze fell on Tian Tian, Zhang Chenze, and Lin Qin.

These three women had not yet stated their position.

"Of course I'm staying." Zhang Chenze smiled slightly. "I'm a lawyer. Before I have complete information, I won't take the initiative. That would lead me to make wrong judgments."

With that, she stood up and walked to the side of Officer Li and Dr. Zhao.
