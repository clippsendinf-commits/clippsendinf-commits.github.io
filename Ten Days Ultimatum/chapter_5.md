# Chapter 5: The Doctor

"I..." The man in the white coat appeared calmer than the others, not even affected by the corpse on the table. "My name is Zhao Haibo, I'm a doctor, as you can probably tell from my attire."

He tugged at his dirty white coat and continued, "Before coming here, I was performing surgery on a woman. She had an intraventricular tumor that was growing rapidly. It had been continuously enlarging for the past six months and had already caused mild hydrocephalus. If we didn't perform a craniotomy soon, her life would be in danger."

"I chose a frontal lobe surgical approach, directly puncturing into the ventricle under CT guidance. Every such surgery carries considerable risks, but the woman chose to take the chance so she could continue to accompany her young son for years to come."

"Normally, to maintain a stable environment in the operating room, even the slightest breeze isn't allowed. But no one expected something more powerful than wind to arrive."

"When the earthquake struck, I had just removed the woman's skull and was cutting the dura mater. If something went wrong at this step, it could easily cause brain contusion, leaving devastating aftereffects."

"I made an immediate decision to terminate the surgery and temporarily place the skull back. Otherwise, in the dusty environment, the woman's life would be in jeopardy."

"But I didn't expect this step to be more difficult than I imagined. I couldn't even stand steadily, so how could I possibly place a small piece of skull back accurately?"

"A nurse beside me knocked me off balance. Everyone was unable to maintain their footing. In the chaos, I could only cover the woman's head with a sterile sheet first, then immediately turn to organize everyone's evacuation. But at that moment, I was hit in the leg by a medical cart and fell to the ground."

"Before I could stand up again, the ceiling of the operating room cracked open, and I immediately lost consciousness."

After listening to the doctor's story, everyone looked uneasy.

He had used many medical terms in his story.

If even one of these terms was fabricated, no one would be able to identify it.

"Dr. Zhao, where are you from?" the muscular man asked casually.

"I don't feel obligated to answer your question," Dr. Zhao replied. "I've finished telling my story."

The muscular man opened his mouth but said nothing.

"Is, is it my turn?" A young man with glasses hesitated for a moment, then said, "My name is Han Yimo, I'm a..."

"Wait." The goat-headed figure suddenly interrupted Han Yimo's speech.

This action startled Han Yimo, and he turned back in confusion.

"Wh-what is it?"

"It's time for 'intermission,'" the goat-headed figure said with a smirk. "You'll have a twenty-minute break now."

Everyone looked bewildered.

An 'intermission' at a time like this?

Qi Xia glanced at the clock in the center of the table. From waking up until now, half an hour had passed.

It was now twelve-thirty.

"So this 'break' is mandatory," Qi Xia thought to himself. "At twelve-thirty, regardless of who is speaking, a mandatory twenty-minute break is enforced..."

But the game had only been going on for thirty minutes, and now they had to take a twenty-minute break?

Qi Xia frowned, knowing this wasn't something he needed to consider.

The organizers of this game were madmen anyway; there was no need to think about it with normal logic.

So he could only repeatedly brainwash himself in his mind.

"My name is Li Ming, from Shandong."

Only by drilling this sentence into his mind countless times could he say it naturally when it was his turn to speak.

Everyone looked troubled as they waited quietly.

Although it was called an 'intermission,' the atmosphere grew even more oppressive.

"Excuse me... can we talk?" the muscular man asked the goat-headed figure.

"Oh, of course. This is your free time now. I have no right to interfere."

The muscular man nodded and looked back at Dr. Zhao: "Dr. Zhao, where are you really from?"

Dr. Zhao's face darkened: "I've said it, you seem to have been dissatisfied with me from the beginning. Why must I tell you where I'm from?"

"Don't misunderstand, I mean no harm," the muscular man said in a steady voice. "The more you say, the more authentic it seems. Since everyone else has shared their hometown, there's no need for you to hide it, is there?"

"The more you say, the more authentic it seems?" The doctor shook his head noncommittally. "I only know that 'the more you say, the more mistakes you make.' If the rules are absolute, my current account has no problems. Besides, I don't trust any of you."

"That's a bit biased," the muscular man said. "There are nine people here, and only one is the enemy. If you're willing to cooperate with everyone, we can work together to identify the liar. The more you hide now, the more suspicious you become. This is the second time I've asked you. Will you continue to hide?"

The muscular man seemed very skilled at interrogation. With just a few sentences, he had cornered Dr. Zhao logically.

His meaning was clear.

Only the 'Liar' wouldn't need to trust others, since he already knew his own identity.

If the doctor continued to hide now, he would become the target of everyone's suspicion.

But someone who could become a brain surgeon wouldn't be ordinary. He just snorted and asked, "Then you answer me first. Who are you? What do you do?"

"Me?" The muscular man didn't expect the doctor to suddenly turn the tables on him, and his expression became unnatural.

"That's right. Since you kept questioning me after I spoke, I can also question you before you speak," Dr. Zhao smiled. "Fair, isn't it?"

The muscular man thought for a moment, nodded, and said, "You're right. I have nothing to hide. My name is Li Shangwu, and I'm a criminal police officer."

As soon as these words came out, everyone turned to look at him.

At this moment, the words 'criminal police officer' gave everyone an unimaginable sense of security.

"You're a police officer?!" The doctor was stunned.

No wonder he felt this man was probing for information from the beginning. He was also the first to propose that 'everyone should survive.' Perhaps he really wanted to save everyone.

The doctor's attitude obviously improved considerably: "In that case, I apologize for my earlier attitude. I'm from Jiangsu."

At this point, the tattooed man Qiao Jiajin's expression looked unpleasant: "I say, Dr. Zhao, are you going to trust this Officer Li?"

"Hmm?" Dr. Zhao looked at Qiao Jiajin in confusion. "What do you want to say?"

Qiao Jiajin tapped his fingers on the table and said lightly, "It's not 'story time' right now. In other words... anyone can lie now."
