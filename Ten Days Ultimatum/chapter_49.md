# Chapter 49 The Internet

After hearing this, Qiao Jiajin didn't hesitate, passing over the cloth pouch from his waist. Lin Qin immediately followed suit.

Tian Tian looked at these two, her expression somewhat unnatural, but since she was in a vulnerable position, after some thought, she also handed over her pouch.

Qi Xia took all the pouches, sat to one side, and began fiddling with something. After a short while, he tossed away an empty pouch and stood up, saying to the three of them: "We've earned five people's worth this time, ninety-five 'Dao' in total. This number can't be divided evenly among four people, so we'll have to add the one we had left from the beginning to make ninety-six, twenty-four each."

He pushed the three pouches forward and said to them: "I've packed them for you. Remember to count them in front of me. I won't acknowledge any claims afterward."

Tian Tian quickly reached out to take the pouch, opened it, and counted. It was indeed twenty-four 'Dao', not one less.

Lin Qin and Qiao Jiajin, however, reattached their pouches to their waists.

"Aren't you going to count them?" Qi Xia said, "I am a con artist, after all."

"It's fine." Lin Qin shook her head and said, "If I find out later that some are missing, I'll just take them from you."

"Yeah, don't try that with us." Qiao Jiajin also waved his hand, "Where to next?"

Qi Xia looked at the bear arm in Qiao Jiajin's embrace, thought for a moment, and said: "Let's go find something to eat..."

...

The group's thinking was simple: if they could cook this bear arm, as long as it could fill their stomachs, they could swallow it no matter what it tasted like.

But in this dilapidated city, finding the necessities for cooking was extremely difficult.

Clean water source, stove, pot, lighterâ€”none of these things could be found.

The group wandered among abandoned buildings in the city for over an hour, still finding nothing.

When they reached an abandoned restaurant, Qiao Jiajin finally couldn't bear it anymore.

"This isn't working." He threw the bear arm to the ground and flexed his sore wrists, "We're carrying dozens of pounds of meat around everywhere. We'll die from exhaustion before we starve."

"Thank you for your hard work." Lin Qin said to Qiao Jiajin with a smile, "Do you want me to carry it for a while?"

"That's not necessary."

"I feel there's a lot of hope here." Tian Tian looked around the restaurant, noticing that it wasn't severely damaged.

As expected, after a brief search, they found an aluminum pot under a table.

The pot looked relatively clean, just slightly deformed.

"As for firewood, there's plenty everywhere." Qi Xia looked at the damaged furniture on the ground, "The only things missing are water and fire."

"I'll check the kitchen." Tian Tian walked directly toward the back kitchen of the restaurant, "Maybe there's water there."

Qi Xia nodded slightly and began looking for other useful things in the room. After a few seconds, Qi Xia felt something wasn't right, so he said to Qiao Jiajin: "Qiao Jiajin, go with Tian Tian. Be careful of the 'natives'."

"Good point." Qiao Jiajin also nodded and walked toward the kitchen, but before he had taken three steps, he heard Tian Tian's voice from afar.

"Huh? What are you doing here?"

"Oh! Sister, you're here too!"

The voice talking to Tian Tian was female.

Qi Xia and Qiao Jiajin immediately ran to the kitchen. As soon as they opened the door, they saw the slightly chubby girl standing there.

She reached out, affectionately linking her arm with Tian Tian's, and said to everyone: "Why are you all here? What a coincidence, isn't it?"

Qi Xia looked at this woman with cold eyes, his expression somewhat displeased.

"Are you following us?"

"Huh?" The girl showed an expression of disbelief, "How could that be?! I was here first."

Qiao Jiajin wasn't sure what was going on either. Why would this girl deliberately wait here for them?

"Are you looking for something?" the girl asked again.

"Yes, we're looking for water and fire." Tian Tian replied.

"Water and fire?" The girl laughed again, "That's great. We have both here."

Under Qi Xia's cautious gaze, the woman led Tian Tian to a cupboard. She stood on her tiptoes, opened the cupboard door, and inside were indeed several plastic buckets filled with clean water.

Then she took out a lighter from her pocket: "See?"

Qi Xia felt that all of this was too coincidental, as if it had been arranged by someone.

Tian Tian happily took the lighter the woman handed over and asked: "Little girl, are you really going to lend this to us?"

"Sister, don't be so polite." The woman smiled harmlessly, "We survivors should help each other."

Tian Tian suddenly felt a good impression of this woman and thanked her repeatedly.

"What do you want?" Qi Xia asked from the side.

After hearing this, the chubby girl turned her head blankly and replied: "Want something? I don't want anything. I'm just helping you out."

"It had better be that way." Qi Xia ignored her and turned to collect things that could be used as firewood.

"That brother is so strange." The girl blinked her big eyes, "Why is he so guarded against me?"

"That's just his personality. You'll get used to it." Tian Tian also said with a smile, "Little girl, what's your name?"

"Sister, you can just call me Xiao Xiao."

Lin Qin looked at Xiao Xiao from the side, feeling that something was a bit odd.

This girl was slightly chubby with broad shoulders, wearing a very loose T-shirt, but her cheeks were quite thin, not in proportion to her body shape.

"Xiao Xiao, why don't you stay and have something to eat with us?" Tian Tian said, "The four of us can't finish that bear arm."
