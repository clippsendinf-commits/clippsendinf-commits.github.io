# Chapter 1: The Empty Room

An old tungsten lamp hung from the center of the room by a black wire, flickering with dim light.

The quiet atmosphere spread through the room like ink dripping into clear water, gradually staining everything.

In the center of the room sat a large round table, looking worn and mottled. In the middle of the table stood a small clock with intricate patterns, currently ticking away.

Around the table sat ten people in various attires. Their clothes appeared somewhat worn, and their faces were covered in dust.

Some were slumped over the table, others leaned back in their chairs, all sound asleep.

Beside these ten people stood a man wearing a goat head mask and dressed in a black suit.

His gaze peered through the worn goat mask, watching the ten people with keen interest.

The clock on the table chimed as both the minute and hour hands pointed to "twelve."

From somewhere far beyond the room came the deep sound of a bell.

At that same moment, the ten men and women sitting around the round table slowly awakened.

As they gradually regained consciousness, they first looked around in confusion, then at each other with bewilderment.

It seemed none of them remembered why they were there.

"Good morning, nine of you," the goat head spoke first. "It's a pleasure to meet you here. You have been sleeping in my presence for twelve hours."

This man's appearance was truly bizarre, startling everyone in the dim light.

His mask appeared to be made from a real goat's head, with much of the hair turned yellowish-black and matted together.

Two holes had been cut out for the eyes in the goat mask, revealing his cunning eyes.

His every movement exuded not only the unique gamey smell of a goat but also a faint odor of decay.

A man with tattooed arms froze for a few seconds before finally realizing the absurdity of the situation. With hesitation, he asked the goat head, "You... who are you?"

"I believe you all have this question, so let me introduce myself to the nine of you." The goat head waved his hands cheerfully, as if he had long prepared his answer.

A young man named Qi Xia, sitting farthest from the goat head, quickly surveyed the room. After a moment, his expression grew grave.

Strange, this room is truly strange.

There are no doors here, all four sides are walls.

In other words, this room is completely sealedâ€”the walls, ceiling, and floorâ€”yet there's a table in the center.

If that's the case, how did they get here?

Could it be that people were brought here first, and then the walls were built?

Qi Xia looked around again. Here, whether it was the floor, walls, or ceiling, all had intersecting horizontal and vertical lines that divided the surfaces into many large squares.

Another point that concerned Qi Xia was what the goat head had said about "nine of you."

No matter how you counted, there were ten people sitting around the round table. Adding the goat head himself, there were eleven people in the room.

What did "nine of you" mean?

He reached into his pocket, and as expected, his phone had already been taken.

"There's no need for introductions," a cool-voiced woman said to the goat head. "I advise you to stop what you're doing. I suspect you've detained us for over twenty-four hours, which constitutes 'illegal detention.' Every word you say now will be recorded and used as evidence against you."

As she spoke, she disdainfully brushed the dust from her arms, as if she disliked being dirty more than being imprisoned.

The cool-voiced woman's words indeed sobered everyone up. Whoever this person was, to dare to kidnap ten people alone had already crossed the legal bottom line.

"Wait..." a middle-aged man in a white coat interrupted everyone's train of thought. He slowly turned to the cool-voiced woman and asked, "We just woke up. How do you know we've been detained for 'twenty-four hours'?"

His tone was steady and firm, yet pointedly direct.

The cool-voiced woman calmly pointed to the clock on the table and replied, "The clock here points to twelve. I have a habit of staying up late, and the last time I checked the time at home, it was already twelve. This means we've been detained for at least twelve hours."

After speaking, she pointed to the surrounding walls and continued, "You must have noticed there are no doors in this room, which means this person went to great trouble to get us inside. He said we've been sleeping for twelve hours, and now the clock points to twelve again, indicating it has made at least two full rotations. Therefore, I suspect 'over twenty-four hours.' Is there a problem with that?"

After hearing this answer, the man in the white coat gave the woman a cold look, his gaze still filled with suspicion.

After all, in this environment, this woman was too calm.

Would a normal person facing such a kidnapping calmly say what she said?

At this moment, a sturdy young man in a black T-shirt asked, "Goat head, why are there ten people here, but you say there are nine?"

The goat head remained silent, not answering immediately.

"Damn it, I don't care how many people are here..." the tattooed man cursed, pushing against the table to stand up, only to find his legs were weak and couldn't support him. He could only continue pointing at the goat head and say, "Bastard, I advise you to be sensible. You might not know how serious the consequences are for provoking me, but I will really kill you."

Once these words were spoken, the expressions of the men present gradually grew serious. At this moment, they indeed needed someone to take the lead. If they could subdue the goat head together, the situation would still be under control.
