# Chapter 28: Parting Ways

Dr. Zhao came out at this moment, his expression evasive.

From his appearance, he didn't seem to be there to stop them, but rather to join forces.

"There aren't four 'Dao,' only three now," Qi Xia said.

"Three?!" Xiao Ran frowned, "You lost one?"

Qi Xia glanced at Dr. Zhao behind Xiao Ran, his eyes carrying a hint of coldness.

Dr. Zhao seemed to notice Qi Xia's gaze and could only speak up:

"Xiao Ran, it's not that Qi Xia lost one. He used one of the 'Dao' to trade with that female shopkeeper for fishing hooks and line."

"What..." Xiao Ran's eyes moved slightly, then she sighed and said to Qi Xia, "Fine, it's your business if you use 'Dao' for trading. Now I want you to return the two that belong to our team."

"Belong to your team...?" Qi Xia's expression turned cold.

"Xiao Ran..." Tian Tian, who had been silent, suddenly interjected, "You can't say that. If we're really calculating, then the lost 'Dao' was to save Han Yimo from 'your team,' which has nothing to do with us."

"I've said it before, that was Qi Xia's own decision to trade, it has nothing to do with our team."

"You mother..." Qiao Jiajin took a step forward, his expression fierce, his previously non-standard Mandarin completely switching to Cantonese, "I never hit women, but you're really shameless!"

"Hey... calm down!" Lin Qin stepped forward and grabbed Qiao Jiajin, saying, "Those 'Dao' were won by Qi Xia, so let him decide how to distribute them."

Qiao Jiajin pressed his lips together resentfully, barely suppressing his anger.

Qi Xia slowly raised his hand to touch his nose, then said:

"The 'Human Dragon' said these 'Dao' are both our prizes and our 'chips' for participating in the games. You're planning to wait here to die, so I won't give you any of them."

"What, not using 'deception' anymore, switching to 'robbery'?" Xiao Ran said with an angry laugh, "There's no 'lawless place' in this world. I advise you to think clearly, is this right? We have a police officer here!"

Officer Li, hearing the dispute outside, also came out.

The two teams originally had no barriers between them, but now because of this kindergarten teacher named Xiao Ran, the atmosphere was tense.

"What's wrong?" Officer Li asked Dr. Zhao, "I could hear quite a commotion from inside the house."

"It's nothing... Xiao Ran has something to say to Qi Xia." Dr. Zhao smiled awkwardly.

"She 'has something to say to me'?" Qi Xia's expression turned cold, "Dr. Zhao, you're really something... Are you sure it's Xiao Ran who has something to say to me?"

Qi Xia knew that Xiao Ran was just a 'gun,' and Dr. Zhao was the real instigator of this matter. After all, with Xiao Ran's intelligence and courage, without someone egging her on, she would never dare to confront Qi Xia and his four companions.

Destroying the opponent's 'gun' can stop the attack, but defeating the opponent's 'person' can solve the problem once and for all.

"I..." Dr. Zhao was taken aback, then said somewhat embarrassedly to Qi Xia, "Qi Xia, you might be somewhat dissatisfied... Those 'Dao' were indeed won with your help... but they belong to all of us, we also contributed... You should give us half."

"Is that so?" Qi Xia nodded seriously after hearing this, and replied, "But Dr. Zhao, when you and I killed Han Yimo together last night, you didn't say that."

"What?!" Dr. Zhao's eyes widened at these words, "You, you bastard, what nonsense are you talking about?! When did I kill Han Yimo with you?!"

Officer Li and Xiao Ran's expressions instantly changed.

"Didn't you say that?" Qi Xia casually rubbed his hands, "You told me 'that person's wounds aren't even stitched properly, he definitely won't survive. One less person means one less burden, and the remaining people will have a greater chance of getting out.'"

"Nonsense!!" Dr. Zhao was completely angered by Qi Xia, the veins on his forehead bulging, "Are you trying to smear me?! Although Han Yimo's wounds were indeed difficult to handle, I stopped his bleeding...! You... you..."

"Why are you so angry?" Qi Xia took a step forward, patted Dr. Zhao's shoulder, and said to Xiao Ran and Officer Li, "Don't mind him, I'm a swindler, I was just making up what I said earlier."

"You...!" Dr. Zhao was so angry his mouth twisted.

"Do you hate having black turned into white?" Qi Xia said in a low voice, "I hate it too. If you and that woman come to entangle me again, asking for things that don't belong to you, I'll definitely teach you a lesson."

Dr. Zhao was frightened by these words and finally realized that the man before him was no kind person.

In previous games, although Qi Xia had helped out time and time again, it didn't mean he could be slaughtered at will.

Xiao Ran seemed to realize something at this moment, muttering to herself, "So that's how it is... because you're a doctor... when injured people appear, you have to take care of them. You killed him to get rid of this burden..."

"I..."

"How could that be possible?" Before Dr. Zhao could speak, Qi Xia shook his head and denied, "Xiao Ran, I was really just making up what I said earlier, you must not believe it."

But the seed of doubt had already quietly taken root in Xiao Ran's heart, how could it be easily pulled out?

"Qi Xia... what kind of show is this? What exactly happened?" Officer Li asked with a frown.

Qi Xia looked at the sturdy man before him. His impression of this officer was quite good, and he only hoped they weren't colluding to covet his 'Dao.'
