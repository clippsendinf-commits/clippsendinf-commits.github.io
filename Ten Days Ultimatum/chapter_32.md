# Chapter 32: Wagering Life

After those words, everyone was stunned.

Even the Human Rat froze for a moment.

"You want to... wager your life?" the Human Rat confirmed.

"That's right." Qi Xia nodded. "I want to wager my life."

The Human Rat's throat moved slightly as she swallowed, then said: "Th-there's no need for that, is there?"

Her reaction exceeded Qi Xia's expectations.

He had thought these animal-masked beings would be willing to wager their own lives, so why was she panicking?

"I... this is just a simple 'find the item' game. You... you wagering your life is too extreme... And my entry fee is only one 'Dao'â€”you don't need to wager your life..."

Lin Qin and Qiao Jiajin were also confused.

"This game... can you really wager your life?" Qiao Jiajin frowned and asked, "But Scammer, why do you want to wager your life? Don't we have enough 'Dao'?"

"I remembered what that withered old man said and want to test it here." Qi Xia said softly, "Judging by her reaction, she seems very afraid of me 'wagering my life'."

"I know you really want to win," Lin Qin interjected, "but if you wager your life to open a can, what happens if something goes wrong? What if the 'Dao' isn't inside?"

"I will win." After saying this, Qi Xia looked up at the Human Rat. "I've already placed my bet. Can we begin?"

The Human Rat remained silent for a long time before finally saying with a trembling voice: "If you truly want to wager your life, then don't regret it... The game begins now."

Qi Xia walked into the room.

Just as the Human Rat was about to exit and close the door, Qi Xia grabbed her.

This action made the Human Rat's entire body stiffen.

Qi Xia, expressionless, extended his hand and slowly pulled a 'Dao' from the Human Rat's upper pocket.

"I found it."

The three people at the door all widened their mouths.

Was this allowed?

To find the 'Dao' on the referee's person the moment the game started.

Did this really not break the 'rules'?

The Human Rat trembled continuously, appearing extremely frightened.

"If I'm not mistaken, as long as you close the door, it becomes impossible for there to be any 'Dao' in this room, right?" Qi Xia asked aggressively.

"How did you know..."

"It's simple." Qi Xia said softly, "Every time you explain the game rules, you must stand inside the room and tell us that there is 'one Dao' in the room 'now'. What you said wasn't wrong, but unfortunately, it's a huge trap."

Seeing that the Human Rat didn't respond, Qi Xia continued: "There is indeed 'one Dao' in the room 'now', but unfortunately, it will disappear immediately."

The eyes beneath the Human Rat's mask began to spin wildly. After holding back for a long time, she asked: "You wagered your life on such a bold assumption?"

"Assumption? Of course not." Qi Xia continued, "What truly convinced me was when you declared Tian Tian's 'game failure'."

"What?!"

"At that time, the door was closed. Logically, none of us should have known what was happening inside, but the moment you opened the door, you told Tian Tian she had failed." Qi Xia shook his helplessly, "How would you know she hadn't found it?"

"I..."

"The answer is obvious. You knew there couldn't be any 'Dao' in the room."

The Human Rat's body shivered slightly.

"And the 'rat game' was another trap. We all thought rats like to hide during the day and come out at night, searching for targets in darknessâ€”that was the direction Tian Tian was thinking, and logically, she wasn't wrong. But there are other types of rats in this world, ones that hide important things in their own mouths, right?"

The Human Rat stared at Qi Xia for a long time, knowing she had truly lost.

She paused, then suddenly exerted great force to push Qi Xia down and turned to flee.

"Damn it!" Seeing this, Qiao Jiajin immediately reached out to grab the Human Rat, but she dodged like a real rat with a quick turn.

Her running speed was very fast as she disappeared down the street.

The group was momentarily at a lossâ€”they had never imagined these animal-masked beings would actually flee.

"What's going on... Scammer?" Qiao Jiajin helped Qi Xia up from the ground, his face full of confusion, "Why did she run away?"

"I don't know either." Qi Xia shook his head, but his expression suggested he had realized something.

Could 'wagering life' actually mean...

He looked in the direction the Human Rat had fled, wanting to confirm his thoughts, but couldn't help but widen his eyes.

"What's wrong?"

Qi Xia extended his hand, pointing tremblingly at the distance.

The three turned to look and were instantly frozen in place.

A floating person appeared in mid-air, blocking the Human Rat's path.

"Damn it... is that a Terminator...?" Qiao Jiajin's voice trembled slightly, the scene before him completely beyond his imagination.

The person floating in mid-air gently waved his hand, and the Human Rat collapsed as if she had lost all strength in her body.

Then, the two disappeared in the distance, and the next second appeared before Qi Xia and the others.

This scene, like a deity descending to earth, left the four of them momentarily blank-minded.

The one floating in mid-air was a slender man, naked except for a cape made of blood-red feathers. Several feathers were also inserted in his messy long hair. At this moment, his entire body moved up and down in the air, like a flying bird.

The four were terrified by the sight before them, and none dared to speak.

The Human Rat was trembling even more, as if whimpering could be heard beneath her mask.

"Human Rat, what are you doing?" the man asked softly, "Were you trying to escape just now?"

"I... I..." the Human Rat trembled continuously, her voice distorted.

"Running away won't do." The man slowly landed, extending his hand to gently stroke the Human Rat's head, "You need to be obedient. 'Wagering life' is 'wagering life'."

"Lord Zhuque...!" the Human Rat cried out, "Please spare me...!"

"That won't do." The one called 'Zhuque' extended slender fingers, continuously tracing across the Human Rat's mask, "When you make a bet, you must accept the outcome. He was the one who wanted to wager his life with you, so there's nothing I can do."

Qi Xia felt a sense of foreboding. He mustered his courage and spoke to the other party: "I... I don't want her life. I wagered my own life just to obtain more 'Dao'."

"Oh?" Zhuque lifted his eyes to look at Qi Xia, but his hand slowly moved down to the Human Rat's pale neck, gripping her like one would hold a real mouse.

The Human Rat's body stiffened as she trembled, not daring to say a word.

"Is this necessary?" Qi Xia frowned, "I was the one who initiated the 'life wager'. Now I don't want her life anymore, only the 'Dao'. Killing her brings me no benefit."

Hearing Qi Xia seemingly pleading for her, the Human Rat slowly raised her head to look at him, her eyes filled with tears.

Hearing Qi Xia's words, Zhuque slowly withdrew his hand and chuckled.

"How interesting... Human Rat, get up now... He has spared you." He patted the Human Rat's back.
