# Chapter 42: Seeking Advantages and Avoiding Harm

"Cough, cough..." Qiao Jiajin lay on the ground, coughing incessantly, feeling as if his internal organs had been shattered.

Little Glasses reacted quickly, immediately scrambling to his feet and beginning to reset the iron plate.

"Come help!" he shouted at the women behind him, "If these two fall, we're all done for!"

Though terrified, the women understood the urgency of the situation. They all bent down, gritting their teeth as they began to move the iron plate.

Qi Xia lay on the ground, his head spinning.

The black bear's blow seemed to have knocked his soul right out of his body. He truly wondered how Qiao Jiajin had managed to withstand two attacks alone.

"I'll make that fat bastard who ran away pay..." Qiao Jiajin cursed through clenched teeth.

"Seeking advantages and avoiding harm... it's human nature..." Qi Xia lay on the ground, muttering to himself, "As stated in 'Memorial to General Liang Shang,' 'As for seeking advantages and avoiding harm, fearing death and loving life, all are equally so'..."

"Did you get knocked silly?" Qiao Jiajin struggled to open his eyes and look at Qi Xia, "What the hell does it have to do with some general? If that bastard hadn't suddenly abandoned us, this iron plate wouldn't have fallen like this..."

By now, the women had already propped up the iron plate, and Little Glasses bent down again to help Qi Xia and Qiao Jiajin: "Brothers, are you okay?"

The two stood up, weakly supporting the iron plate.

"I wouldn't say 'okay,' only 'not dead'," Qiao Jiajin replied as he glanced at the black bear.

After this collision, the beast wasn't in much better shape either. Its massive body looked dazed as it continuously shook its head to stay conscious.

"It's my turn now!" Little Glasses said, "You two rest at the back of the group for a while."

With that, he imitated Qiao Jiajin's posture, lowering his body and using his shoulder to brace against the iron plate.

But Little Glasses appeared too thin and weak. Simply holding the plate seemed extremely strenuous for him. His legs trembled continuously, and veins bulged on his forehead.

"Damn... is this iron plate this heavy..." He seemed to feel his posture was wrong and slightly adjusted the angle of his legs, but the iron plate didn't get any lighter.

"Brother, it's not that I don't trust you," Qiao Jiajin shook his head helplessly, "If you're the one holding this plate, there's no point in us standing behind it. We're dead either way."

"Uh... maybe you should do it instead..." Little Glasses laughed awkwardly and stepped aside.

By now, the group had basically readjusted their defensive formation, and Qiao Jiajin was once again braced against the iron plate.

The black bear had also mostly recovered. It wanted to charge at the iron plate again but noticed the middle-aged man standing alone to the side.

"Oh no! Lao LÃ¼!" Little Glasses panicked, "Hurry over here!"

"Hmph." Qiao Jiajin snorted coldly, "If that fat bastard wants to go out and die, let him."

"No..." Little Glasses' expression turned cold, "Lao LÃ¼ saved my life before. I can't just leave him!"

"You're an idiot." Qiao Jiajin said.

But before Little Glasses could figure out a way to save Lao LÃ¼, the black bear had already positioned itself between the group and Lao LÃ¼.

It seemed to understand that once Lao LÃ¼ hid behind the iron plate, it would have no chance to kill him.

Little Glasses looked extremely anxious now. After hesitating for a long time, he finally turned back to Qi Xia and said, "Can you save Lao LÃ¼?!"

Qi Xia's eyes turned cold as he said, "I can. You go save him. I won't stop you."

"I... I can't... so I want to ask you..." Little Glasses said, trembling, "You seem like a very capable person. Can you help me..."

"No." Qi Xia said without hesitation, "If you want to save him, go yourself."

After hearing this, Little Glasses wanted to say more, but after careful consideration, he realized he had no suitable reason to ask a stranger to risk their life.

He thought for a long time before finally gritting his teeth and saying, "Then... then fine... I'll go save him..."

He slowly released his grip on Qi Xia's clothes and stared at the black bear.

Next, Little Glasses took three deep breaths in a rather comical manner, then shouted to bolster his courage, stamped his right foot on the ground, and was about to charge toward the black bear.

At the critical moment, Qi Xia reached out and stopped him.

"Damn it..." Little Glasses jumped in surprise, nearly twisting his waist from being stopped, "What are you doing?!"

"You'll die. Aren't you afraid?" Qi Xia asked slowly.

"Of course I'm fucking afraid!" Little Glasses was about to cry, "But I can't just watch Lao LÃ¼ die!"

"In that case, I'll make a deal with you." Qi Xia stared at the black bear in the distance, "If I can get you through this game alive, your 'Dao' will belong to me."

"Huh?" Little Glasses hadn't expected Qi Xia to suddenly make such a demand and didn't know how to respond.

"Of course, if you're not willing, you can go save him yourself."

Qi Xia's tone was indisputable, putting Little Glasses in a difficult position.

He and Lao LÃ¼ had risked their lives to participate in this game, only to not even obtain a single 'Dao'. What would be the point of it all?

"I can only promise to give you my 'Dao,' but as for Lao LÃ¼'s..." Little Glasses said hesitantly, "I don't know if he's willing."

"Then you'll guarantee it for him." Qi Xia said, "You two are together, right?"

"I... I..." Little Glasses thought it over and over again, but still felt that 'life' was more important than 'Dao,' "Fine... I'll guarantee it for him. If we both survive, our 'Dao' will belong to you."

"Good." Qi Xia nodded, "Take off your shoes and give them to me."

"What?"

"Your shoes." Qi Xia repeated.

Not knowing what he intended, Little Glasses quickly took off his two dirty sneakers and handed them to Qi Xia.

"The laws of hunting, animals are naturally sensitive..." Qi Xia silently recited in his heart again, "First taboo: attacking from behind."

Qi Xia weighed one sneaker in his hand, then suddenly took a step forward and forcefully threw it, hitting the black bear squarely on its back.

This startled the black bear greatly. Its whole body seemed to tremble as it quickly turned around to look around.

"Second taboo: severely injuring the nose."

Qi Xia picked up the other sneaker and threw it fiercely at the black bear's face.

The shoe flew to the black bear's nose. Though the force wasn't great, it made the beast stumble.

The black bear was enraged again, completely ignoring Lao LÃ¼ before it, and turned to charge at Qi Xia.

Qi Xia reacted quickly, immediately pulling on Qiao Jiajin's clothes to adjust the direction of the iron plate.

This attack from the black bear seemed haphazard, merely slapping its front paws against the iron plate.

Once, twice, three times.

Though it roared furiously, the power of these attacks was clearly not as strong as before. All were blocked by Qiao Jiajin and the iron plate.

At this moment, Lao LÃ¼ also scrambled over in panic and rejoined the group.
