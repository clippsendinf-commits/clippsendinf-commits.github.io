# Chapter 23: The Transaction

Dr. Zhao looked at Qi Xia with difficulty, and Qi Xia didn't know how to respond either.

"Will this work?" Qi Xia asked quietly.

"It shouldn't be a problem." Dr. Zhao nodded. "Medical suturing needles are often curved, as long as they're sharp enough."

Qi Xia thought for a moment, then said to the female shopkeeper, "Miss, we don't have money. Can we trade something for it?"

"Money?" The female shopkeeper stared blankly at Qi Xia, as if trying to understand what "money" meant. After a long time, she finally said, "I don't want money. Sleep with me."

"Sleep...?" Qi Xia's lips moved slightly. "What do you mean?"

"After we sleep together, we can eat the little piglets!" The female shopkeeper showed a crazed expression, then actually drooled.

After speaking, she walked to the dirty bed, bent down to sit, then patted the spot beside her.

That spot happened to have a large patch of dried blood.

"Come on, hurry over."

The female shopkeeper quickly took off her top. She wore nothing underneath, her emaciated body covered in dirt and bloodstains, looking like a skeleton.

Qiao Jiajin was silent for a long time before nudging Qi Xia with his elbow and saying, "You should sacrifice yourself."

"Why don't you go?" Qi Xia said irritably.

"The boss picked you." Qiao Jiajin said gleefully, "Didn't you hear? If you sleep with her, we can eat the piglets in her pot. Besides, the writer is waiting for that fish hook to save his life. This would be a meritorious deed..."

Before Qi Xia could reply, the female shopkeeper seemed to hear what Qiao Jiajin said, so she turned to him and said, "You can come too! All four of you can come!"

"Ah?" Qiao Jiajin was stunned, "Me...?"

"What is this..." Officer Li finally couldn't take it anymore. After so many years on the force, the situation before him was completely beyond his comprehension. "Miss, what do you want from us? We're here to buy things, why do you need to offer yourself?"

"I..." The female shopkeeper's eyes widened, and she suddenly shouted, "I want to eat piglets!!"

After saying this, she seemed to remember something, quickly placed the fish hook and line on the bed, then ran to the iron pot to look inside.

"Little piglets... don't let them be overcooked..."

She worriedly picked up a branch and stirred in the pot a few times.

Taking advantage of this moment, Qi Xia quietly walked to the bed, picked up the fish hook and line, turned back to hand them to Dr. Zhao, and said, "Go save him first. We'll handle things here."

"Okay!"

Dr. Zhao took the fish hook and line outside, found a relatively clean stone from the ground, and began to process the fish hook. He briefly explained the situation inside the room to the women.

Tian Tian, as a professional, still couldn't understand the shopkeeper's behavior.

"Never mind that. Qi Xia is right, let's save him first." Lin Qin took the line and went back to check on Han Yimo's condition.

Dr. Zhao used the stone to grind off the rust on the fish hook, then tried to sharpen it as much as possible. Lin Qin also organized the tangled fishing line beside him.

"That should be good enough..." After Dr. Zhao confirmed everything was ready, he turned to Han Yimo and said, "I'm going to remove the fish fork and stitch your wound now."

"Okay..." Han Yimo nodded slightly.

"But we don't have anesthesia." Dr. Zhao said with difficulty, "The pain might be beyond your imagination."

"It's fine... at least I can survive, right?" Han Yimo asked with a bitter smile.

"If the wound doesn't get infected... surviving shouldn't be a problem."

"Then that's good... let's do it..."

...

Inside the room, the three men stood behind the female shopkeeper, watching her stir the pot.

She wasn't wearing any clothes, but the three men felt nothing, even wanting to escape.

"Hey, swindler." Qiao Jiajin asked quietly, "You stole her 'goods,' what if she gets angry later?"

"I don't know." Qi Xia shook his head.

Officer Li was silent for a moment, then said quietly, "We still have 'Dao,' right? I wonder if she wants it?"

"How could we do that?!" Qiao Jiajin said unhappily, "That's 'Dao' we exchanged with all our lives. Are you just going to give it to this madwoman?"

"We're also saving a life here!"

As the two were arguing, the female shopkeeper slowly turned back.

She seemed relieved, calmly walking to the bed where the fish hook and line had been, now empty.

She hesitantly looked at the bed, as if something was wrong: "Huh?"

But soon she shook her head and said, "Right... sleeping. Which of you three will go first?"

The female shopkeeper looked up at the three people before her, her expression dazed again as she asked, "Not three? Have there always been three of you? Never mind, three is fine too."

Qiao Jiajin shook his head and said quietly, "See, she's crazier than I thought."

"Hmm..." Qi Xia was stunned for a long time before saying, "We don't want to sleep with you. We're just here to buy things."

After speaking, he took out a golden, shining "Dao" from his pocket and placed it beside the female shopkeeper, then continued, "I don't know if this is considered valuable, but this is all we have."

According to Qi Xia's thinking, people living here must recognize those animal masks and must have heard more or less about "Dao." No matter how you look at it, something exchanged with life should have some value.
