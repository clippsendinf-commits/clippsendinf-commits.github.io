# Chapter 8: The Reveal

These words seemed to awaken everyone, and they awakened Qi Xia as well.

Yes, the odds for "The Liar" were indeed too favorable.

Qi Xia frowned. Why were his odds of winning so high?

Lying to a group of strangers who didn't know him or understand himâ€”any fabricated lie would be difficult for anyone to see through.

Could using a fake name really doom eight lives?

Or perhaps...

The person who drew "The Liar" was chosen by fate, and this was inherently an unfair game?

"No..." Qi Xia thought to himself, "if drawing the card meant survival, they might as well have written 'Life' and 'Death' on the cards. That would have more easily achieved their purpose. Otherwise, what's the meaning of this nearly hour-long game?"

A deep sense of incongruity spread through his mind.

Qi Xia kept recalling every word the Human Goat had said.

Could it be...

"Hey, it's your turn." Qiao Jiajin reached out and patted Qi Xia.

Only then did he snap back to reality, realizing everyone was looking at him with strange expressions.

It was too late for further consideration now, or he would appear even more suspicious.

He took a deep breath and reorganized his thoughts.

The phrase "My name is Li Ming, from Shandong" kept echoing in his mind...

But he absolutely couldn't use that answer now. To find the "solution" to this game, he had to take a gamble.

Qi Xia opened his eyes and said to everyone, "Everyone, my name is Qi Xia, I'm from Shandong, and I'm a professional con artist."

"A con artist?"

Everyone present exclaimed as soon as they heard Qi Xia's first sentence. After all, the character of a "con artist" had appeared in many people's stories.

This con artist also vaguely connected everyone's stories.

Even more ironically, they had to determine whether a "con artist" was telling the truth.

"Before coming here, I was trying to launder the two million in my hands."

"In short, it took some effort, and I ended up with 1.4 million. That was already the most cost-effective method I could think of."

"But on my way back with the money, I suddenly encountered an earthquake. When I reached the door, I saw my house shaking continuously."

"Logically, I absolutely shouldn't have gone indoors at such a time, as the house could collapse at any moment. But I was worried about the people inside, so I had to rush in."

"As expected, the moment I entered the room, the porch collapsed, and I was trapped, losing consciousness."

Qi Xia finished his story in a calm tone with just a few sentences, while everyone watched him vigilantly.

He knew he was doing something very risky, but this was the only way to verify whether his theory was correct.

As long as the Human Goat spoke up now, it would mean his guess was mostly correct.

Just as Qi Xia expected, the Human Goat slowly stepped forward and said to everyone, "Very good, everyone has finished telling their stories. Next is twenty minutes of free discussion. After twenty minutes, each person needs to write down a name on the white paper in front of them."

"As expected!" Qi Xia's eyebrows rose. "There really is twenty minutes!"

This explained everything!

Everyone began to panic now, as only twenty minutes remained to decide their life or death.

Qiao Jiajin and Li Shangwu both wanted to vote for each other, perhaps due to their professions, the two were filled with hostility.

Dr. Zhao began to question the novelist Han Yimo, as Han Yimo's story had no connection to anyone else's.

Lawyer Zhang and Xiao Ran seemed suspicious of Qi Xia, while Lin Qin, Han Yimo, and Tian Tian were still hesitating.

According to the surface rules, "The Liar" was about to win this game.

Because the votes weren't unified.

The rules were very clear: only if everyone selected the liar could all eight people survive together.

Qi Xia didn't participate in any discussion, silently closing his eyes.

Countless clues swirled in his mind.

The Human Goat said, "Among the storytellers, there is one and only one liar."

The Human Goat said, "The rules are absolute."

The Human Goat said, "Everyone has been asleep for twelve hours."

Qi Xia opened his eyes. Now only one more piece of information was needed to solve this "puzzle."

But where was that information?

Suddenly, a flash of insight struck his mind.

The crisscrossing lines on the walls and floor instantly cleared his thoughts. He glanced at the clock on the tableâ€”it was almost 1 o'clock.

"So that's how it is..." Qi Xia's eyes widened. "That was close... I'm clearly a con artist, but I was almost fooled by you."

Everyone seemed to notice Qi Xia's change, but this con artist had spoken little from the beginning, so no one knew what he was thinking.

"Hey, can you give me another piece of paper?" Qi Xia asked the Human Goat.

Hearing this, the Human Goat was clearly startled, then tentatively asked, "You... want another piece of paper?"

"Yes." Qi Xia nodded. "I need a piece of scratch paper."

The Human Goat was silent for a long time, then took out another piece of paper from his suit pocket and handed it to Qi Xia.

Qi Xia didn't stand on ceremony, taking the paper and beginning to calculate.

He counted the large squares on the wallâ€”nine in totalâ€”while the squares on the floor and ceiling totaled sixteen.

"If I'm not mistaken..." Qi Xia quickly wrote something, "there's one square per square meter, which means we're currently in a room three meters high, four meters long and four meters wide..."
