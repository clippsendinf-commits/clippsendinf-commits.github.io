# Chapter 33: Fluttering with Joy

The Human Rat, still shaken, glanced nervously at Zhuque, as if seeking his approval.

"What? Do you need me to help you up?" Zhuque asked with a smile.

"N-no, I don't need to..." The Human Rat stood up trembling.

After a long pause, she finally said to Qi Xia, "Thank you! Thank you!"

Qi Xia shook his head. "You don't need to thank me. I was just..."

Thwack

Before he could finish, Qi Xia saw a hand emerge from the Human Rat's abdomen.

Her body stiffened, and her voice cut off abruptly.

Warm, sticky blood splattered all over Qi Xia.

Zhuque embraced the Human Rat from behind, as if holding a lover.

"This child is quite polite," Zhuque said with his eyes closed, pressing his face against the Human Rat's cheek, as if sniffing her scent. "Saying 'thank you' is a good habit, but you broke the rules by trying to escape. He may have spared you, but I won't."

With that, Zhuque extended his other hand, removed the Human Rat's mask, and tossed it to the ground.

Face to face with the Human Rat, Qi Xia could now see clearly.

This "Human Rat" was clearly just a teenage girl.

Her face still held traces of youth, her tear-filled eyes were full of fear and despair, and she was coughing up blood.

"It... it hurts so much..." the Human Rat spat out a large mouthful of blood.

"Good... it won't hurt for much longer..." Zhuque nuzzled against the Human Rat's hair. "You'll die soon. Don't worry... don't worry... once you're dead, it'll all be over..."

"What kind of monster are you?!" Qiao Jiajin couldn't bear to watch. "She's just a child! Damn you... let her go!"

Zhuque sneered, withdrew his bloody hand, and pushed the Human Rat forward.

Qi Xia instinctively caught the girl, his expression filled with shock.

That's right. This was "betting one's life."

When he won, the other party would die.

Even if he didn't want her to die, she would still die.

This little girl called Human Rat had been forced to her death by Qi Xia.

He thought he was only betting his own life, but he never considered that the other party would offer the same price.

But weren't they supposed to be the game organizers?

Were these animal masks also some kind of "participants"?

"Qi Xia, why are you here?" Zhuque asked coldly, shaking the blood from his hand.

"What..." Qi Xia froze, looking up at him. "You know my name?"

Zhuque's lips curled slightly, then he pointed at the four of them, calling out their names in turn: "Qi Xia, Qiao Jiajin, Lin Qin, Zhang Lijuan. Why are you all here?"

Tian Tian also froze. "Zhang Lijuan" was her real name, but she hadn't used it since she was fourteen.

"What do you mean, 'why are we here'?" Lin Qin asked. "If we're not here, where should we be?"

A meaningful smile remained on Zhuque's face as he slowly shook his head and said, "It seems you really don't know why you're here. How truly pathetic."

"If you have something to say, say it directly. What's with all this beating around the bush?" Qi Xia asked, holding the dying Human Rat in his arms, his gaze exceptionally cold. "Do you think being mysterious makes you seem profound?"

Hearing this, Zhuque's expression gradually grew stern, and the smile that had been on his face disappeared.

"Qi Xia, I really don't get along with you," Zhuque looked at him with contempt. "You'll never escape. Just rot here."

"Oh?" In this situation, Qi Xia had nothing left to fear, and he pressed on aggressively. "Rot here? Are you going to kill me now?"

Zhuque flashed to Qi Xia's side, his feathered cape fluttering behind him.

He grabbed Qi Xia's collar and said viciously, "If not for the rules restricting me, I would tear you apart right here!"

"So... according to the 'rules,' you can't kill me," Qi Xia replied.

"Hehe..." Zhuque finally smiled again. "Even if I don't kill you, you'll die here anyway."

Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Zhuque slowly floated into the air, like a deity.

"Why do you think I'll die here?" Qi Xia asked, looking up.

"Because you are Qi Xia, so you're destined to die here," Zhuque snorted, then vanished into thin air.

He didn't fly away like immortals in TV dramas, nor did he disappear with a flash of light like magic. He simply vanished in an instant.

This sudden change left everyone bewildered.

"Because I'm Qi Xia... so I'll die here?"

"Cough..." The Human Rat in Qi Xia's arms coughed.

Qi Xia looked down at her. The girl's face was clean, unlike the others in this world.

His feelings were complicated. If he hadn't chosen to bet his life, this girl probably wouldn't have met this fate.

Thinking about it, she had never been hostile to him from the beginning.

One "Dao" for one "Dao."

Perhaps, as she had said, Qi Xia would never find such a simple, safe game again.

The Human Rat reached into her pocket and slowly took out three "Dao," then said with difficulty, "What a pity... I waited here for so long. You were the first participants. I thought I could earn some 'Dao'..."

She handed the "Dao" to Qi Xia and continued intermittently, "One of these is your entrance fee, and the other three are my own 'Dao.' They're all yours now..."

The four of them looked at the girl before them, not knowing what to say.

From their standpoint, they should have been enemies. But the girl's helplessness and despair struck a chord deep within them, evoking an indescribable resonance.

"Are you some kind of participant too?" Qi Xia asked coldly.

Hearing this, the Human Rat actually laughed, and blood began to flow from her mouth again. "Who here isn't a 'participant'... To be honest... I'd rather be like you, never having worn the 'Rat' mask... even though none of us can escape..."

Her head slowly tilted to the side, and her arm fell to the ground.

The two women sighed, and even Qiao Jiajin looked sad.

But Qi Xia's expression remained as cold as ever.

He laid the girl flat on the ground and slowly stood up. No one knew what he was thinking.

"Qi Xia... are you okay?" Lin Qin asked.

"Me?" Qi Xia was slightly taken aback. "Do I look like something's wrong?"

"Because there's no expression on your face... that's not normal."

"I..."

Before he could finish, Qi Xia suddenly felt a splitting headache. He let out a sharp cry and fell to the ground, clutching his head.

"Hey! Liar!" Qiao Jiajin sensed something was wrong with Qi Xia. When Han Yimo died this morning, Qi Xia had also experienced a headache.

Qi Xia felt as if his head was about to split open, with something pulsing deep in his brain.
