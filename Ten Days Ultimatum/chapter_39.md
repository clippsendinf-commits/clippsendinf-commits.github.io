# Chapter 39: Iron Plate

The black bear took another step forward, now only a little more than a meter away from Qiao Jiajin.

This time, Qiao Jiajin didn't dare to move forward any further. The black bear's arm span was long, and moving any closer would put him within its attack range - undoubtedly suicide.

So he could only slowly take a step back.

Seeing this, Qi Xia showed a hint of nervousness.

The rules of confrontation between animals are very simple. If one side retreats, it means they're afraid.

And fear turns one into prey.

Seeing Qiao Jiajin take a step back, the black bear's hesitant demeanor gradually turned violent. It was now almost certain that the creature before it posed no threat.

After pausing for three seconds, the black bear suddenly lunged forward, its thick forearms swinging down like stone pillars.

Qiao Jiajin no longer tried to be brave. He crouched down to dodge the attack, rolled backward on the ground, and immediately started running.

The black bear roared and chased after him on all fours.

The black bear now completely regarded Qiao Jiajin as prey.

"Trickster! Hurry up!" Qiao Jiajin shouted as he ran, "I'm entrusting this worthless life of mine to you!"

"Don't trust me too much either!" Qi Xia said, somewhat nervously, "I don't even know what this iron plate is..."

"What the hell are you talking about?" Qiao Jiajin cursed, "Hurry up and 'retrieve the goods'!"

Seeing the black bear run off, Qi Xia immediately ran toward the iron plate on the ground.

Logically speaking, none of the previous "games" had been dead ends. There would always be a "path to survival." In this completely visible room, the path to survival must be related to this iron plate.

As he got closer, he saw that the surface of the iron plate was mottled with many rusted areas.

"This..."

Qi Xia reached out and touched it, only to find that it was just a very ordinary circular iron plate with no mechanisms or text hints.

"What is this..." Qi Xia felt like he'd been tricked. This iron plate was simply like a piece of trash that could be found anywhere.

Qiao Jiajin ran about a dozen steps and found the black bear was right behind him. He immediately stopped running, suddenly turned around, and roared: "Idiot!!"

The black bear was startled by Qiao Jiajin and immediately took a big step back, standing on its hind legs again.

Qiao Jiajin sneered, viciously pointing at the black bear with his finger: "Were you scared? You idiot, you think I'm afraid of you? Listen carefully..."

The black bear stared blankly at Qiao Jiajin, seemingly waiting for him to speak.

Everyone present was also confused, all looking at Qiao Jiajin, wondering what he was going to say to a black bear.

But what no one expected was that after stabilizing the black bear, Qiao Jiajin didn't hesitate for a moment. He turned around and ran.

Realizing it had been tricked, the black bear roared even more violently and chased after him again.

Meanwhile, Qi Xia in the center of the room had already turned the iron plate over and was studying it carefully. The plate was very thick, without even a handle, making it impossible to lift to resist the bear's attack.

Before Qi Xia could figure it out, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his back, as if something had hit him hard.

He was already crouching on the ground, and with such a strong impact, he couldn't maintain his balance and fell to the side.

Only then did he see that it was the middle-aged man from their group who had collided with him.

The middle-aged man glanced at Qi Xia, who had been knocked over, and said softly, "I'm sorry," then stood the iron plate up, gritted his teeth, and slowly pushed it across the ground. After a few steps, he reached a corner, then used the iron plate to shield himself, shivering as he huddled in the corner.

Qi Xia frowned, sensing trouble.

He had considered this method before - using the iron plate to shield oneself in a corner of the room would greatly increase the chances of survival. But this way, only one person could survive, and the game would lose its meaning.

Betting one's life for one "Dao" only to win one "Dao" in the end.

If Qi Xia had to choose, he wouldn't choose this outcome.

"Trickster, are you ready yet?!" Qiao Jiajin shouted again, "You really don't take me seriously!"

"Hold on, hold on..." Qi Xia replied hesitantly, "Give me a bit more time..."

His mind raced, knowing that even if he took back the iron plate now, it wouldn't be of much use. After all, he needed to save both himself and Qiao Jiajin.

But the iron plate had limited space, barely enough to shield one person.

What was he to do?

For now, thanks to Qiao Jiajin, the remaining eight participants were temporarily safe. But only a little over a minute had passed. To survive for ten minutes, they couldn't rely solely on Qiao Jiajin.

At this moment, a slightly chubby-looking girl ran toward the middle-aged man, saying in a trembling voice: "Can you let me hide in there...? Please... I don't want to die..."

"No, no!" the middle-aged man shouted from behind the circular iron plate, "There's only room for one person here... If you come in, we'll both die!"

"It won't happen!" the girl's voice trembled continuously, and her legs became unsteady, "We can each hide on one side, we definitely won't die..."

As they were talking, the young man with glasses who had previously been on the same team as the middle-aged man ran over in a panic. Without asking the middle-aged man's permission, he directly lifted the iron plate and squeezed into the corner.

"Hey! Little Glasses!" the middle-aged man became flustered, "What are you doing?"

The young man with glasses gritted his teeth and replied: "Old LÃ¼, you can't just think about saving yourself!"

This is a good translation, but I should review it once more to ensure it flows well and captures the tension of the scene. Let me refine it a bit more:
