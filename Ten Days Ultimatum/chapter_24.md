# Chapter 24: Outcast

"Hehe..." Han Yimo gave a bitter smile, "Dr. Zhao, you're overthinking. As a novelist, the last thing I want to talk about is my own work... If I have free time, I'd rather forget everything in my stories and just relax."

"Then let's talk about something else!" Dr. Zhao was slowly stitching the wound, but since it was circular, it was more complex to stitch than a regular wound. He steadied himself and asked again, "Tell me, besides writing, how do you usually relax?"

"I... I play games."

Dr. Zhao nodded: "That's great! I play games after work too. What games do you play?"

Due to excessive blood loss, Han Yimo's thinking was very slow. After a long time, he finally said: "League of Legends... there's a female ninja named 'Akali' in it, I really like this character."

"Oh?" Dr. Zhao smiled, "What a coincidence! I play League of Legends too, and I also like Akali."

Although he spoke in a calm tone, everyone could see his hands trembling slightly. After all, after so many years as a doctor, this was the first time he was stitching a wound without anesthesia while the patient was conscious. No one knew if he genuinely liked this character or was simply trying to follow Han Yimo's topic of conversation.

"You like Akali too, Dr. Zhao?" Han Yimo nodded weakly, "I'm fascinated by everything about Akari... this female ninja called 'Fist of Shadow,' I feel that her background story is also..."

Dr. Zhao's hands paused slightly, then he stroked Han Yimo's face and asked: "Han Yimo, can you see me?"

"Huh?" Han Yimo didn't understand why Dr. Zhao suddenly asked this question and could only answer, "I can see you..."

"Who am I?"

"You're Dr. Zhao..."

After hearing this, Dr. Zhao nodded again and said: "Han Yimo, you're experiencing hallucinations now. You must stay conscious."

"Hallucinations?" Han Yimo felt his current state was still normal and didn't understand what Dr. Zhao meant, "Aren't we having a normal conversation? How could I be having hallucinations..."

"It should be a symptom of excessive blood loss. Your brain isn't getting enough blood. The Akali you mentioned, her hero title is 'The Rogue Assassin,' not 'Fist of Shadow.'"

"The Rogue Assassin?" Han Yimo narrowed his eyes, somewhat hesitant. He had never heard this name before. Could this also be because of the hallucinations?

Qiao Jiajin poked Qi Xia from the side and asked: "Liar, what are they talking about?"

"I don't know." Qi Xia shook his head, "I don't play games, I don't understand."

"I've played video games before." Qiao Jiajin pouted, "But I've never heard of the game they're talking about. Is this hero fighting game more interesting than 'Fatal Fury'..."

Qi Xia didn't want to participate in this topic, so he walked to the side and found a clean stone to sit on.

He was thinking about something else.

The conversation between Han Yimo and Dr. Zhao also fell silent, probably because Han Yimo was having too many hallucinations, making the conversation impossible to continue.

The atmosphere among the group gradually became silent.

Lin Qin found she couldn't help much, so she sat down next to Qi Xia.

"What are you thinking about?" Lin Qin asked.

Qi Xia turned to look at Lin Qin, his expression cold.

"This is the second time you've asked me 'what are you thinking about.'" Qi Xia said, "Do you always ask your patients so directly when doing psychological counseling?"

"But you're not my patient." Lin Qin shook her head, "We don't call our clients 'patients' either, that's very impolite. I'm just genuinely curious. With someone as smart as you, what exactly fills your mind?"

"My wife." Qi Xia said with a melancholy expression.

"Your wife?" Lin Qin nodded silently, "You mentioned before that someone was waiting for you outside. Was that person your wife?"

"Yes." Qi Xia nodded.

Lin Qin smiled slightly: "I didn't guess this would be the answer. So you're already married?"

"Why couldn't I be married?" Qi Xia felt there was something behind Lin Qin's words.

"I don't mean to offend you. But you're a con artist. What kind of person is your wife?"

"You..." Qi Xia rarely showed anger. He slowly stood up, his eyes incredibly cold, "What do you mean? I'm a con artist, so the person who would marry me must be from the dregs of society, is that it?"

"Ah? I..." Lin Qin was intimidated by Qi Xia's aura, "I really didn't mean to offend, I was just curious..."

"I advise you not to be curious about me." Qi Xia said coldly, "I'm a con artist, and what I say won't be the truth."

The conversation between the two ended unpleasantly, but Lin Qin's expression didn't seem to care.

Dr. Zhao had finally finished stitching the wound.

"That should do it..." Dr. Zhao said as he wiped the blood from his hands, "We've done everything we can for now. We can only hope the wound doesn't get infected."

"Thank you..." Han Yimo's lips were pale as he slowly said to Dr. Zhao.

Seeing that everything had come to an end, Qi Xia slowly stood up and said to everyone: "Everyone, it's time to say goodbye."

The other eight people all looked confused upon hearing this.

Say goodbye?

"Where are you going?" Qiao Jiajin asked.

"That's none of your business." Qi Xia looked at the restaurant across the street, lost in thought.

"You're not really going to find the 'Dao', are you?!" Officer Li was stunned.
