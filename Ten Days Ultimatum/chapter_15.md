# Chapter 15: One Wave Has Not Yet Subsided

Qi Xia's expression showed some difficulty. He had just tried it, and the barbs on this harpoon were extremely cleverly designed, making it nearly impossible to pull out from the body.

Looking at the gushing blood, Qi Xia felt a moment of dizziness.

Are they really dead?

Can dead people... still get injured?

Qi Xia steadied his nerves. Now was not the time to ponder this question, but to immediately cut the rope.

All the harpoons were slowly retracting now. How could he use another harpoon to cut his rope?

The only certainty was that when all the ropes retracted into the wall, the harpoons would all disappear, and Han Yimo would die.

"I need to find a way to get a harpoon... but how exactly..." Qi Xia frowned slightly, quickly scanning his surroundings.

He could only take another gamble.

He grabbed two slowly retracting harpoons from the ground, then quickly tied their ropes together, making a tight knot.

"Hey! Stop hovering around Han Yimo," Qi Xia said aloud. "Do what I'm doing! We need to keep at least one harpoon."

Lin Qin immediately understood his meaning and also found two harpoons, tying them together neatly and efficiently.

But the knot she tied was very strange, one Qi Xia had never seen before.

He didn't have time to think about it now, focusing only on the two harpoons before him.

As the ropes continued to contract, the two ropes were now pulling tightly against each other.

At this rate, it wouldn't be long before one rope would break, leaving behind one of the harpoons.

Qi Xia slowly stepped back. The two ropes were now making a terrifying sound. If his guess was correct, the breaking rope under such immense tension could potentially injure someone.

Sure enough, the next second, one of the ropes made a loud sound as it snapped.

The other rope, with its harpoon, flailed wildly in the air for a moment before slamming heavily to the ground, leaving a deep mark.

Qi Xia rushed forward, wanting to untie the broken rope before the harpoon retracted into the wall.

But he discovered that the two ropes he had tied together were now completely deformed from the immense pulling force. Forget untying themâ€”it was difficult to even recognize their original shape.

"I'm done!" Lin Qin shouted from nearby. "Who's strong? Come help cut the writer's rope."

"Done?"

Qi Xia looked back and saw that the knot Lin Qin had tied was so clever that it had automatically separated when the rope broke.

Officer Li hadn't even finished tying his initial knot. Hearing this, he quickly put down the harpoon in his hands and said, "I'll cut it, give it to me!"

After taking the harpoon, Officer Li rushed over in a few strides, reaching behind Han Yimo just as he was about to be pulled against the wall.

Fortunately, although the harpoon in his hand had a pointed tip, there was also a small sharpened edge at the tip, enough to be used as a small knife.

Seeing this, Qiao Jiajin also stepped forward to help. Although Qi Xia had thought of a solution immediately, Han Yimo was now less than half a meter from the wall.

This tearing pain made it impossible for Han Yimo to resist. He could only follow the rope's slow retreat, otherwise the barbs in his chest would cause him unbearable pain.

Officer Li grabbed the rope behind him, and after a brief moment of thought, aimed at the rope closest to Han Yimo's body and began cutting with the sharp harpoon.

His hands were steady, each cut accurately landing on the rope.

But the rope was tougher than expected. After several cuts, only a small notch remained.

He quickly assessed the situation and realized things were a bit tricky.

Although the rope would eventually be cut, what they lacked most now was time.

In less than a minute, Han Yimo's body would touch the wall, making it impossible to cut the rope from behind.

"Damn it, not done yet?" Qiao Jiajin asked anxiously. "You're too slow, you're going to get this guy killed!"

"Stop your damn whining!" Officer Li barked coldly, then continued to exert more force.

As Han Yimo's body drew closer to the wall, Officer Li's face was already covered in fine sweat.

It must be said his mental fortitude was extremely strong. Although the air was filled with tension and oppression, he hadn't made a single mistake while using the small harpoon, each cut landing precisely on the previous notch.

But with Han Yimo less than thirty centimeters from the wall, Officer Li's arm could barely move.

Qiao Jiajin acted quickly, directly blocking behind Han Yimo, using his own body as a buffer. This way, although Han Yimo would be injured sooner, the distance between him and the wall wouldn't change for the time being.

"Cop! Hurry!"

Officer Li held his breath and continued cutting. The rope was now more than halfway severed, but still holding together.

Han Yimo continued to groan in pain. The harpoon had pierced through his body and the barbs had stabbed viciously back into his chest. His blood had now soaked his clothes, looking terrifying.

"Am I going to die..." Han Yimo said through gritted teeth. "I'm really going to die, aren't I... who wants us dead..."

"Be a man!" Officer Li said sternly. "So many people are trying to save you. Don't you dare cry and whimper!"

Hearing this, Han Yimo immediately fell silent. He knew Officer Li was right. Everyone was running around trying to help, and he couldn't hold them back.

The barbs dug deep into Han Yimo's flesh, and he grunted, continuously gritting his teeth.

Seeing this, Dr. Zhao immediately picked up a strip of cloth and stuffed it into his mouth.

Let me review this translation to ensure it's accurate and natural:

I've maintained the tension and urgency of the original text
I've translated the character names consistently (Qi Xia, Lin Qin, Han Yimo, etc.)
I've kept the dialogue natural and in character
I've preserved the sequence of events accurately
I've formatted the chapter title with a hash symbol as requested

I think this translation is good, but let me make a few refinements to ensure it flows even better in English:
