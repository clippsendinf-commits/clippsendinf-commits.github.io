# Chapter 34: My Tactics

Qi Xia clutched his hair tightly, patiently waiting for the headache to subside.

After about half a minute, he steadied his breathing, slowly lowered his hands, and stood up.

His expression was as if nothing had happened at all.

The headache, like a gust of wind passing by, though fierce when it came, always faded away at some moment.

Lin Qin glanced at Qi Xia and asked, "Are... are you alright? Do you often get headaches?"

"No, this is only the second time since I can remember," Qi Xia sighed and said, "I suspect it's related to this cursed place."

Lin Qin wanted to ask more, but it seemed Qi Xia didn't want to dwell on this issue.

"Our time is limited. Even if worms are growing in my head, I don't plan on getting diagnosed here," Qi Xia looked up at the dark red sky and continued, "Thanks to this little girl, we've learned a lot of useful information."

"Have we?" Tian Tian looked at the corpse of the Human Rat on the ground, her expression still somewhat sad. "I feel the only useful information we got was about the rules of 'betting life.' And this child died because of it."

"Not just that," Qi Xia said, "I originally thought this was a land filled with chaos and madness, but now it seems this place has its own 'rules'."

"'Rules'...?"

"That's right." Qi Xia nodded, "The man called 'Zhuque' just now should be one of the managers here."

"Manager? You mean that 'bird man'?" Qiao Jiajin asked.

"Yes, he appeared to ensure the 'rules' weren't broken."

"But why doesn't the manager wear clothes..." Tian Tian was a bit confused, "He's naked with just a cape, which looks very strange."

"Compared to his various bizarre behaviors, 'not wearing clothes' is already the most normal thing." Qi Xia paused, then added, "This is just what we can see with our eyes. Perhaps there are others above the 'managers'."

Lin Qin seemed to have thought of something: "Right... that person called Zhuque once said something like 'if it weren't for the rules' restrictions, I would have killed you'."

Qiao Jiajin also nodded: "Someone who can restrain that kind of madman with special abilities, I believe the people above him would be even more terrifying."

"'Special abilities'?" Qi Xia frowned, "I haven't heard that term in a long time."

"Isn't it special abilities? Like the Terminator." Qiao Jiajin gestured, "That man was flying in the sky!"

Hearing this, the three of them paused for a moment.

"What does 'Terminator' mean?" Lin Qin looked at Qiao Jiajin curiously.

"You dress quite fashionably, but you're actually a country bumpkin?" Qiao Jiajin grinned, "You've never even seen Terminator?"

"Fashionable?" Lin Qin awkwardly opened her mouth. This word could now only be heard from the older generation. Just saying it was already outdated enough.

Yet she was being looked down upon by someone like this.

Qiao Jiajin nudged Qi Xia with his elbow and asked, "Liar, you must have seen it, right? Arnold Schwarzenegger, couldn't be cooler!"

"Arnold Schwarzenegger...?" Lin Qin seemed to have heard this name, but maybe not.

"I don't care about 'Terminator' or Schwarzenegger, and I don't care how incredible that bird man is." Qi Xia paused and said, "I just want to know how extensive the 'rules' are and to what extent they can regulate."

The three didn't understand what Qi Xia meant and looked at each other.

"Liar, what are you going to do?"

Qi Xia slowly extended his hand and gestured at his own neck, saying to the three, "I want to know if 'killing to take Dao' is really feasible."

At these words, Lin Qin and Tian Tian each took a step back.

Only Qiao Jiajin remained where he was.

"Killing to take 'Dao'?" Qiao Jiajin frowned, his expression extremely serious, "You mean... if you don't gather 3,600 'Dao' within ten days, you'll go and rob others?"

"Yes, that's the most effective method I can think of." Qi Xia said, "We're a team now. If we're going to accomplish something this big, I need your help. So I'm telling you my plan now to hear what you think."

"I won't help you." Qiao Jiajin decisively shook his head, "Even if this place collapses, I won't do something unrighteous. Those who have 'Dao' are probably just like us, having survived through countless hardships. What reason do we have to kill them?"

"Is that so..." Qi Xia nodded with a complex expression, "But if we want to escape this cursed place, this is the only way. That's 3,600 'Dao'... are you really not willing to try?"

"I refuse too." Lin Qin also spoke up, "I don't think this is a good idea. If we really kill people, even if we can get out of here, we won't be able to live the same life as before."

Tian Tian thought for a long time and said, "Yes, if it means killing others, I'd rather die first."

Qi Xia looked at the three people's eyes, pondered for a long time, then slightly raised the corners of his mouth:

"Very good. Now I can safely tell you my real plan."

"What..." Qiao Jiajin was stunned, "Damn it, Liar, you were testing us?!"

Qi Xia nodded and said, "If you three could accept a plan like 'killing to take Dao,' it would only prove we're not the same kind of people. I would abandon you at any time."

"You..." Qiao Jiajin was almost angered to death by Qi Xia, "I thought you were really going to kill someone."

"Logically speaking, the 'rules' wouldn't allow 'killing to take Dao' to happen." Qi Xia explained, "Although I'm not clear about what the rules here are exactly, they seem to be maintaining a kind of 'bizarre fairness.' Those managers are more like 'referees.' If they're really 'referees,' they must ensure the safety of the participants."

He paused and added, "In other words... they want us to die in the games, not kill each other."

Everyone fell silent after hearing Qi Xia's words.

After a while, Lin Qin came back to her senses and asked, "If that's the case, what's your real plan?"

"My plan isn't complicated." Qi Xia answered, "Since these games won't kill us, we'll 'test' them one by one. You first figure out the game rules and collect clues along the way. When we're confident... I'll go 'bet life.' We'll split all the 'Dao' we get equally. Before we reach 3,600, we can keep using this tactic."
