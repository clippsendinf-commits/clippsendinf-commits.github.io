# Chapter 9: An Unacceptable Truth

Everyone's expressions faltered after seeing those three words.

"I drew 'The Liar'," Qi Xia said slowly. "But it doesn't matter whether we reveal this card or not, because it's completely irrelevant."

He picked up the card and casually tossed it into the center of the table.

"If I'm not mistaken, every one of you is holding 'The Liar' as well."

No one moved after hearing this. After a moment, Officer Li finally spoke: "So... are you saying that everyone just lied?"

"That's right." Qi Xia nodded. "You're all smarter than I expected. Each of you added a small lie to your stories, making them completely plausible without affecting the narrative logic."

Officer Li pondered for a moment, as if realizing something.

"If what you're saying is true..." Officer Li sighed meaningfully, "the problem becomes even more complicated."

Everyone looked at Officer Li, confused.

Officer Li continued: "According to the rules, only if we all select the liar can we survive together. But if we do that, the liar loses. So we..."

Dr. Zhao was the first to understand Officer Li's meaning: "Are you saying... we can vote arbitrarily, since everyone is lying, this becomes a 'guaranteed win game,' and only the person who gets voted will die?"

"That's right." Officer Li nodded. "The optimal strategy now is to concentrate all votes on one person, minimizing casualties, since the others can survive..."

His words once again suppressed the atmosphere to an extreme, while the Human Goat remained motionless.

So... they were just voting for one person to die?

Qi Xia sighed helplessly, looking at Officer Li and saying: "Officer, is interrupting others your hobby? Does it give you a sense of accomplishment?"

"What kind of talk is that?" Officer Li replied with a frown. "Aren't I helping you strategize?"

"I don't need your help." Qi Xia said without hesitation. "Your thinking will get everyone killed."

"What?" Officer Li was stunned. "Why would my thinking get everyone killed? Am I wrong? If everyone is lying, wouldn't any vote be valid?"

"Officer Li, did the Human Goat say, 'The rules are absolute,' 'There is one and only one liar,' do you remember?"

"That's..." Officer Li paused slightly, recalling that the Human Goat had indeed said these two things.

"Let me organize our thoughts now." Qi Xia said coldly. "In this game, it seems 'The Liar' has a high chance of winning, because everyone feels they're about to win. But if we vote arbitrarily, in the end, all of us will die."

Qiao Jiajin, sitting beside Qi Xia, stroked his tattooed arm and muttered to himself: "Because we would break 'the rules'..."

"Yes." Qi Xia nodded. "But the interesting thing about this game is that we can't determine if others are lying at all. As Lawyer Zhang said, we can only rely on contradictions in our experiences to determine this, but we're not even from the same region. Even if our stories contradict, there's no absolute certainty that others are lying."

Qi Xia looked at the thoughtful group, then continued: "The 'host' specifically chose the nine of us to sit here, certainly with a purposeâ€”to make us find flaws in seemingly interconnected stories based on our own assumptions."

"But is that really right? What certainty do we have that others must be lying?" Qi Xia sneered. "In this game, the only 'Liar' we can be one hundred percent certain about from known clues is this one person. What he says is completely different from our current situation."

Qi Xia took the pen and quickly wrote "Human Goat" on the paper.

"I was wondering earlier why the Human Goat introduced himself with such a strange name at the beginning. It seemed unnecessary. Now I realize this is also part of the game."

Everyone slowly turned to look at the "Human Goat," who remained motionless.

Officer Li was stunned for a moment, then shook his head: "Liar, I have a question. The Human Goat's rule was 'There is one and only one liar among all storytellers,' but he didn't tell a story."

"Didn't he?" Qi Xia shrugged noncommittally. "I clearly remember the Human Goat saying he gathered us here to create a 'god.' Isn't that an absurd story?"

Officer Li silently lowered his head. He felt what Qi Xia said made sense, but something felt off.

"But..." Dr. Zhao spoke up, "All your assumptions are based on the premise that 'everyone is a liar,' but why are you so certain we're liars? What if we reveal the cards and you're the only 'Liar'?"

"You couldn't have told the truth." Qi Xia gave a bitter smile, his expression somewhat desperate. "I also spent some time verifying this. I not only know you're all lying, but I also know where you lied."

He pushed his draft paper forward, then looked at Tian Tian beside him: "Tian Tian. You were 'working' in the car, with your head outside. Did the falling billboard really hit the car and knock you unconscious?"

Tian Tian pressed her lips together, not daring to speak.

"Qiao Jiajin, you fell from such a high place onto the billboard. Did you really just 'lose consciousness'?"

Qiao Jiajin remained silent.

"Teacher Xiao Ran, you were leading that child. Did you really dodge that speeding car?"

Xiao Ran's eyes darted away.

"Dr. Zhao, operating rooms are built more sturdily than regular rooms to maintain stability. You said the operating room ceiling collapsed. Were you really just knocked unconscious?"

Dr. Zhao turned his head to the side.

"Han Yimo, you said you had no idea what happened, but writers fear disturbances most when focused. Don't you know how you got here?"

Han Yimo sighed softly.

"Lawyer Zhang, your car crashed into a fissure. How deep was that fissure?"

Lawyer Zhang crossed her arms, expressionless.

"Officer Li, what brand of car were you driving? One that can instantly recline the seat and break free from someone restraining you from behind?"

Officer Li touched the red marks on his neck, hesitating to speak.

"Lin Qin, your ceiling also collapsed, but you said your studio was on a high floor. Once a high-rise begins to collapse, wouldn't the entire building cease to exist?"

Lin Qin lowered her head deeply.

Seeing everyone's expressions, Qi Xia gritted his teeth and said:

"Everyone, admit it. Including myself, we are all already dead."
