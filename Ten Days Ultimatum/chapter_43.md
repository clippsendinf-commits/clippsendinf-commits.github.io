# Chapter 43: Twenty Seconds

The black bear attacked continuously for seven or eight times, with each attack becoming weaker than the last.

The heavy impact sounds gradually turned into insignificant slaps.

"That's about it..." Qi Xia said, "Its attacks should stop here."

Just as Qi Xia had predicted, after its final weak attack, the black bear cautiously looked at the iron plate in front of it, snorted a few puffs of hot air from its nose, and gave up.

It didn't seem very tired, but it stopped attacking.

"It's over already?" Qiao Jiajin peeked from the side of the iron plate, "That thing should still have strength left."

"Animals are different from humans. To deal with dangers everywhere in nature, they rarely let themselves fall into a state of exhaustion. Even if it still has energy now, it's not prepared to fight this iron plate to the death."

Sure enough, the black bear silently turned around and walked toward a corpse on the ground.

This was the woman who had died at the beginning of the game.

Similarly, she was also a more stable and safer food source for the black bear.

The black bear's eyes stared in the direction of the iron plate, then sniffed the corpse on the ground, and then opened its mouth, "puchi" sound as it bit through the corpse's belly.

The sound was like biting through a plastic bag filled with water, with red things spilling all over the ground.

Then, the black bear nudged with its nose and began to use its tongue to select satisfactory organs. After a short while, "slurping" sounds could be heard, as if it was eating deliciously.

Everyone turned their faces away, unable to bear watching this scene.

The black bear, while eating, looked toward the iron plate, forming a strange standoff between the two sides.

Fortunately, there wasn't much time left.

In the tense and oppressive atmosphere, the black bear made no further moves, only eating the entire abdomen of the corpse, revealing several bare ribs.

Qi Xia looked at the time, only thirty seconds left. It seemed the game was about to end.

But at this moment, the well-fed black bear suddenly let out a low growl and twisted its huge body to run over again.

It seemed to know that time was running out and was preparing to go all out.

"It's coming!! Get ready!!" Qi Xia shouted loudly, reminding Qiao Jiajin.

Qiao Jiajin kicked his feet backward, his body at an angle against the iron plate.

The line behind him also quickly stood up. At this point, everyone showed some unity, each person firmly holding the person in front of them.

They thought they could safely pass through this attack as well, but unexpectedly, the black bear actually stood up as it reached the iron plate. Its two-meter-high form gave everyone a great sense of oppression.

"This is bad..." Qi Xia suddenly felt something was wrong.

The next second, the black bear placed its two front paws on top of the iron plate, sticking its head over. It opened its mouth, with fragments of human flesh between its teeth.

"ROARâ€”!!"

With a huge roar, Qi Xia felt his ears were about to be deafened, and the black bear's foul-smelling saliva sprayed all over his face.

"Hold on!" Little Glasses shouted loudly.

Qiao Jiajin gritted his teeth tightly, forcefully pushing against the iron plate. He clearly felt several hundred kilograms of weight pushing forward, attempting to crush him into a meat patty.

"I... damn it..."

Qiao Jiajin found it difficult even to speak. Qi Xia immediately stepped forward to help him hold it. The black bear's strength was too terrifying, causing the people behind to be somewhat stunned.

The black bear pushed forward forcefully a few more times, finding that the iron plate couldn't move forward even a bit, and actually grabbed the edge with both hands, suddenly pulling in its own direction.

Qiao Jiajin and Qi Xia were originally pushing against the iron plate with outward force, but never expected the black bear to also pull outward, directly flipping the iron plate to the ground.

The two instantly lost their strength and fell to the ground.

"CLANG!!"

With the loud sound of the iron plate hitting the ground, everyone was exposed to the black bear's eyes, including Qiao Jiajin and Qi Xia, who were most vulnerable.

Before the two could react, the black bear immediately stretched out its front paw to strike at Qiao Jiajin.

Qiao Jiajin suddenly rolled over, narrowly avoiding this attack.

"Hey! Liar! Get up!!" Qiao Jiajin, who had rolled to the side, shouted loudly, "If you keep lying there, you'll die!!"

Qi Xia kept rolling on the ground, feeling as if he had hit his chest, making it difficult to breathe for a moment.

Qiao Jiajin climbed up, anxiously looking in Qi Xia's direction: "This is bad... Liar, get up quickly!"

Qi Xia also wanted to get up, but his body really hurt too much. He tried several times but fell to the ground.

The black bear seemed to have noticed Qi Xia's situation, so it gave up on the agile Qiao Jiajin and instead pounced toward Qi Xia.

Qiao Jiajin gritted his teeth and stomped his foot. After taking two running steps, he leaped into the air, delivering a knee strike from the side, hitting the black bear's face.

The black bear howled in pain, immediately closed its eyes, and swung with its front claws, hitting Qiao Jiajin's abdomen.

"Ugh!"

This strike looked casual, but it happened to hit the weakest part of the human body. Qiao Jiajin flew straight out.

"Cough cough... damn..." Qiao Jiajin felt as if his ribs were broken.

"What... what should we do..." Little Glasses said nervously, "We have to save them..."

After saying this, he thought of something and immediately turned to the middle-aged man: "Old LÃ¼! Take off your shoes quickly! I have a way to save them!"

"Don't be stupid!" the middle-aged man said, "Little Glasses, are you trying to bring disaster upon yourself?! Now if the black bear eats them both, we'll be safe! Time is almost up!"

Little Glasses looked up and saw that there were indeed less than twenty seconds left in the game.

The black bear was now reaching out its front arm toward Qi Xia. Judging by the current situation, although the game was about to end, Qi Xia would undoubtedly die.

This man had been trying his best to deal with the black bear in front of the iron plate. Regardless of his ultimate purpose, he had indeed saved everyone's lives.

After a second of internal struggle, Little Glasses immediately made up his mind.

"Hey! Bastard!!" he shouted while jumping forward one step, "Don't touch him!!"

The black bear was startled and shrank back.

The middle-aged man was also shocked, growling: "Damn it! Little Glasses, are you crazy?!"

"You blind bear..." Little Glasses ignored the middle-aged man, instead cursing at the black bear, "If you have the guts, come chase me..."

Before he could finish speaking, the black bear immediately pounced over.

Little Glasses was terrified and turned to run. He thought he could, like Qiao Jiajin, entangle with this black bear for dozens of seconds.

But he had never imagined that being chased by a huge hunter filled with endless killing intent would be such a terrifying thing. Hot air kept coming from behind his back, emitting a faint foul smell. Although he tried his best to stay calm, his legs kept trembling, and he fell every two steps he ran.

He could only keep getting up and falling, falling and getting up again.

Looking at this situation, before the black bear killed him, he might kill himself by falling first.

Let me review this translation to make sure it's accurate and flows well. The chapter title is "Chapter 43: Twenty Seconds" and I need to make sure the formatting is correct with the hash symbols.

I notice I've translated "éª—äººä»”" as "Liar" which is a direct translation, but in the context of the story, this seems to be a nickname for Qi Xia. I should check if this is consistent with the rest of the story or if I should use a different translation. Based on the character list provided, Qi Xia is described as a "professional con artist," so "Liar" might actually be an appropriate nickname for him in this context.

I also translated "å°çœ¼é•œ" as "Little Glasses" which is a literal translation of his nickname. This seems appropriate since his real name isn't given in the character list.

The translation seems to capture the tension and action of the scene well. The pacing feels right, and the dialogue sounds natural in English. I'll make a few minor adjustments to improve flow and clarity, but overall I think this translation is good.

Let me finalize the translation with the proper formatting:
