# Chapter 12: Your Hometown

If the phrase "the rules are absolute" still applies to this second "game," then what's written on the mask must be the solution.

But how could this be solved?

And when would the harpoons launch?

"The clock never stops ticking"...

Could it mean 1:15?

Qi Xia glanced at the clock on the table. It was already 1:05 AM. If "1:15" was indeed when the harpoons would launch, they had less than ten minutes left.

"Turn one hundred times toward the direction of your hometown"...

The nine people in the room came from different hometowns, and "one hundred turns" was no small number.

If they were thinking in the wrong direction, they could easily waste these ten minutes.

But in this room, besides himself, what else could "turn"?

Qi Xia's gaze fell on the clock in the center of the table.

He leaned forward and gently touched the clock, only to find it was firmly fixed to the tabletop, not moving an inch.

"The clock can't move. Could it be the chairs?"

Qi Xia looked down at the chair beneath him. It was an old chair emitting a musty smell, casually placed on the floor with no mechanism.

If that wasn't it, then there was only...

Qi Xia reached out and turned the tabletop. Sure enough, there was a faint chain sound from inside the table.

But the table was heavy. With considerable effort, he could only turn it a few centimeters.

"One hundred turns..."

This number definitely couldn't be completed by just two or three people. All nine people in the room would need to work together to turn the tabletop to have a chance at survival.

Lin Qin keenly noticed Qi Xia's action and called for everyone to stop.

Everyone walked to the table to look and found that it could indeed be turned.

"You're really something, swindler." Qiao Jiajin nodded and said, "If we turn this table one hundred times, we should be able to open that invisible door."

Qi Xia glanced at the clock again. Though time was pressing, the problem had become simpler now.

Turning this round table toward the "hometown" direction could only have two answers.

Left, or right.

But everyone's hometowns were located in different directionsâ€”north, south, east, and west. How could they determine whether to turn left or right?

"Qi Xia, do you already know when the harpoons will launch?" Lin Qin asked, covering her mouth and nose.

"The hint says time 'never stops ticking.' I estimate it will be at 1:15." Qi Xia said softly.

Qiao Jiajin's expression changed upon hearing this: "Then we have less than ten minutes left? Let's start turning quickly."

Dr. Zhao moved the corpse lying on the table to the side and slowly sat down. He tested the weight of the table and said: "But we only have one chance. This table is so heavy. What if we turn it in the wrong direction?"

"That's still a fifty percent chance of survival!" Qiao Jiajin said anxiously, "If we don't move, we're dead anyway. If we turn it, there's a fifty percent chance to live. Let's hurry!"

With that, he began to use all his strength to turn the tabletop to the left.

Although Qiao Jiajin looked thin, he was very strong. He alone managed to turn the table half a circle.

"What are you standing there for?! Damn it, help me!" Qiao Jiajin shouted at everyone.

The others knew Qiao Jiajin had a point, so they could only temporarily help him turn it.

There was no correct answer now; they could only take a gamble.

But Qi Xia didn't move.

He didn't know which direction was correct.

Left, or right?

Why was the keyword "hometown"...

Everyone was Chinese, so does that mean "East"?

North is up, south is down, left is west, right is east. Is the answer "right"?

But what about the people from the west?

Or perhaps everyone's hometowns are related to the "Zuo Zhuan" from the Spring and Autumn period, making the answer "left"?

Qi Xia closed his eyes slightly. He had considered using the two corpses to shield himself, but if everyone else died, what would happen when the next game came...

"It's not time to give up on them yet."

Qi Xia muttered to himself, then reached out, grabbed a piece of white paper from the rotating table, picked up a pen, stood up, and walked to the side. He found an empty space to sit down and began to "scribble" something.

Although everyone was a bit confused, their hands didn't stop moving. They had already turned the table more than a dozen times.

"If he hadn't introduced himself as a 'swindler,' I would have thought that guy was a mathematician." Qiao Jiajin said to Tian Tian beside him.

Tian Tian was a bit dizzy from spinning earlier and could only nod perfunctorily.

This time, Qi Xia didn't write out vertical equations but roughly drew a map of the country on the paper.

"Hometown...?"

His mind raced, and suddenly he thought of something.

"Wait, wait..." Qi Xia's eyes widened, "If the 'organizer' has such divine abilities to find people with similar experiences from so many provinces, then are 'provinces' also a key point?"

He turned back, looked at everyone rotating the table, and asked seriously: "Did anyone lie about their 'hometown' earlier?"

Everyone shook their heads.

After all, "hometown" involved accent and speech habits. Lying would easily reveal inconsistencies.

"Very good." Qi Xia nodded slightly, "Now please take turns telling me your hometowns again."

Officer Li was the first to speak: "I'm from Inner Mongolia."

I notice the chapter ends abruptly with "This small chapter is not yet finished. Please click the next page to continue reading the exciting content!" which appears to be a note from the source website rather than part of the actual story. I'll exclude this from my translation.

Let me refine the translation to ensure it flows naturally in English while maintaining the original's tone and meaning:
