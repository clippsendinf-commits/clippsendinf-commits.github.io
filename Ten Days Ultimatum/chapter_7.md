# Chapter 7: Winning Edge

"Officer, you're lying," Qiao Jiajin said coldly.

"Hmph, I knew you'd say that, but what evidence do you have that I'm lying? Just because someone attacked me?"

"Of course not," Qiao Jiajin smiled slightly. "Although I don't know why, the stories told by everyone before had some connection. There were many shared characters in these stories. If we ignore geographical locations, everyone's accounts were reasonable."

"So what?"

"That's where the problem lies," Qiao Jiajin pointed at the lawyer Zhang Chenze. "You and the lawyer have one person in common in your storiesâ€”the 'fraudster who scammed two million.' But your stories contradict each other, which means one of you is lying."

Officer Li paused and asked, "Where's the contradiction?"

Qiao Jiajin shook his head, looking at Officer Li and said, "Lawyer Zhang was already preparing for court, which means in her story, she had 'already caught the suspect.' But you were still on surveillance duty, which means in your story, 'the suspect hasn't been captured yet.' Isn't that a contradiction?"

Officer Li pondered for a moment and said, "I have to admit, your words make some sense, but I think you've been influenced by this 'game.' First, you need to understand a major premise: everyone who told stories before wasn't in the same city as the others. In other words, even if our experiences were similar, we couldn't possibly be talking about the same incident. Since they're different events, they naturally have different outcomes."

Qi Xia watched the two arguing silently, not intervening.

Yes, keep arguing. The more intense the argument, the better.

As long as either of them votes for the other person, the liar wins.

After all, the rules are absoluteâ€”except for the liar, if anyone votes incorrectly, everyone else will be buried with them.

Although Officer Li had already given an explanation, Qiao Jiajin's words had left an impression on everyone's mind.

This was the first time they had discovered contradictory elements in two people's stories.

Qi Xia couldn't help but view this hoodlum named Qiao Jiajin in a new light.

Although he appeared unrestrained, he was smarter than he seemed.

"Um... it's my turn..." a young woman spoke up.

Everyone then collected their thoughts and looked at her.

This woman had screamed loudly when someone died at the beginning.

She seemed to have calmed down now, but her gaze avoided looking at her surroundings.

"Hello everyone, my name is Lin Qin, and I'm a psychological counselor."

Qi Xia paused slightly because the name "Lin Qin" was interesting.

Before the Tang Dynasty, "Lin Qin" meant "apple" in Chinese.

These two characters were poetic and memorable.

Perhaps Miss Lin's parents wanted their daughter to have a unique name, but this name would clearly get her killed here.

Among the people present were writers, teachers, lawyers, doctors, and police officersâ€”they might all know the meaning of "Lin Qin."

If this name circulates in their minds a few times, Lin Qin's story will become memorable.

Seeing that no one reacted, Lin Qin covered her mouth and nose with her hand and continued, "I'm from Ningxia. Before coming here, I was waiting for a client. She's a kindergarten teacher."

Everyone glanced at the kindergarten teacher named Xiao Ran, unsurprisedâ€”another connection in the stories.

"According to her, being a kindergarten teacher is difficult these days. You can't hit or scold children. Parents treat kindergarten teachers as nannies, and children treat them as servants. Every classroom is equipped with surveillance cameras, with parents monitoring in real-time. If your tone is slightly harsh, parents will immediately call the principal."

"But when parents send their children to kindergarten, isn't it to help them establish their values?"

"If teachers can't discipline strictly, how can children recognize their mistakes?"

"She felt that she had been in a state of confusion and depression for a long time."

"So I prepared a treatment plan for her lasting about a month."

"But for some reason, that client never showed up for her appointment, so I kept waiting in my office."

"When the earthquake struck, I had no chance to escape. After all, my office is on the twenty-sixth floor."

"The higher the floor, the stronger the tremors. I felt the entire building shaking."

"I never knew Ningxia could have earthquakes before. This time I experienced it."

"Later, I vaguely remembered the ceiling collapsing. Everything went black, and I didn't know anything else."

After listening to Lin Qin's story, everyone seemed to think of something.

Qiao Jiajin spoke first: "I have two questions."

"Go ahead," Lin Qin asked, still covering her mouth and nose.

"You said every classroom is equipped with 'surveillance cameras.' What do you mean by that?"

No one expected Qiao Jiajin to focus on this point, but Lin Qin, worthy of being a psychological counselor, patiently explained: "I think the 'surveillance cameras' were installed so that parents could see the classroom from anywhere."

"So it's 'closed-circuit television'... Is this an elite kindergarten?" Qiao Jiajin muttered to himself, then asked, "Is the kindergarten teacher you were supposed to meet the Xiao Ran next to you?"

"I don't know," Lin Qin shook her head. "I only added her on WeChat. We were going to discuss other details when we met."

"WeChat?" Qiao Jiajin froze, seemingly not understanding.
