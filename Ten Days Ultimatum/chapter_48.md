# Chapter 48: Harvest

"What did you say?" Qi Xia's eyes widened suddenly. "You're saying you've seen... someone escape from here?"

"That's right." Zhang Shan nodded. "Though to be precise... we only found that person's notes."

"This..." Qi Xia felt something was odd about this. "You only found notes, yet you're certain that person escaped?"

Zhang Shan smiled and nodded, then said to Qi Xia, "Brother, let me make this clear. If you join us, we can share this information with you. But right now... whether you believe it or not, that's all I'm going to say."

Qi Xia roughly understood Zhang Shan's meaning, but he couldn't determine whether the other was telling the truth or lying.

At this moment, a slightly chubby girl who had overheard Zhang Shan's words approached and asked, "Brother... are you still accepting members? I can do anything..."

Zhang Shan looked at the girl and said with a smile, "Miss, it's not that I don't want to accept you, but our goal is to 'conquer all games.' Do you have the determination to face the dangers ahead?"

After hearing this, the chubby girl silently lowered her head. After thinking for a while, she spoke, "I can."

"Haha!" Zhang Shan didn't seem to believe the chubby girl's words. He slowly approached her and said, "Miss, don't force yourself. Just focus on staying alive."

The girl failed to convince Zhang Shan, and her expression darkened.

Seeing that no one else in the room was speaking, Zhang Shan looked at Qi Xia again. He took out a piece of scrap paper from his pocket, dipped his finger in his own blood, and drew a simple sketch.

"This is where we are." Zhang Shan handed the scrap paper to Qi Xia. "If you change your mind, you can come find us."

Qi Xia took the scrap paper, still looking cautiously at the three of them, but Zhang Shan didn't mind. He put his arm around Little Glasses, picked up the two bear arms from the floor, and limped toward the door.

"Hey." Qi Xia called out.

"Hmm?"

Zhang Shan turned around, only to see something white flying toward his face. He quickly reached out to catch it.

It was a cloth bag.

"I've changed my mind this time. I'll only take half." Qi Xia said. "That guy with the glasses is alright. I don't want his 'Dao'."

Zhang Shan looked at the cloth bag in his hand, was stunned for a few seconds, then suddenly laughed heartily: "Hahaha! You've got character!"

Little Glasses beside him looked confused: "Huh? Why? I offered it voluntarily... You clearly said before..."

"I'm a swindler." Qi Xia said coldly. "Don't believe anything I say."

"But, but Mr. Swindler..."

"My name is Qi Xia." Qi Xia said. "Don't call me Mr. Swindler. It sounds terrible."

"Qi Xia..." Zhang Shan repeated the name. "Interesting. I'll remember you."

After saying that, he lifted one of the black bear's forearms and threw it to the four people.

"Whoa!" Qiao Jiajin was startled, but still caught the furry severed limb.

He found the limb was exceptionally heavy, at least twenty to thirty pounds, and it was dripping blood.

Zhang Shan said, "The three of us can't eat all of this, and it's heavy to carry. Help me dispose of it."

"Dispose of it?"

Zhang Shan waved his hand and turned away.

Qi Xia and the other three looked at the bear arm, not knowing what to say, until Zhang Shan and his two companions left the room.

After a while, Earth Ox walked forward and handed them four dirty cloth bags.

"Take them."

Only then did Qi Xia and the others come back to their senses and take their respective rewards.

This time, there were so many "Dao" that they were all a bit overwhelmed. Thanks to Zhang Shan, they also got some long-awaited "food."

The chubby girl looked at Qi Xia from a distance, slowly approached, and asked tentatively, "Can... can I join you? My teammates all died in the 'interview'..."

Qi Xia seemed not to hear the girl's words, just weighed the cloth bag in his hand, and said to the other three, "Let's go."

After saying that, he turned and walked toward the exit, leaving the girl standing awkwardly in place.

Qiao Jiajin shrugged helplessly at the girl and said, "Don't be angry. He's always like this."

Seeing that Qiao Jiajin seemed easy to talk to, the girl grabbed his arm and said nervously, "Please let me join you... I'm so scared right now..."

"This..." Qiao Jiajin had an apologetic smile on his face. "I guess it's okay... Miss, why don't you follow us for now..."

"Hey, Qiao Jiajin." Qi Xia called from a distance, turning back. "Let's go."

Qiao Jiajin looked at Qi Xia and saw him frowning slightly at him.

"Oh, okay, I'm coming." Qiao Jiajin seemed to understand something. He nodded and turned back, saying, "Miss, not this time. Maybe next time."

After saying that, like Qi Xia, he ignored the girl and walked toward the exit.

When the chubby girl saw that Qiao Jiajin had also left, her originally aggrieved expression turned cold, gradually becoming fierce.

At this moment, only she and Earth Ox remained in the room. All the participants had left.

Earth Ox was tidying up the fallen chairs when he looked up at her. After a while, he asked faintly, "Are you still up to your old tricks?"

"Yes." The chubby girl nodded. "It's a pity. Our line of work is getting harder and harder."

"Why can't you be more normal?" Earth Ox turned and asked. "Wouldn't it be better if we just followed orders together?"

"Haha!" The chubby girl was amused into an angry laugh. She stepped forward, grabbed Earth Ox's collar, and asked fiercely, "How dare you speak to me like that?! Speaking of 'normal,' how are you 'Zodiacs' any better than us?!"
