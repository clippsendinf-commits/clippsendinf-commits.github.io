# Chapter 27: Foolishness

"Qi Xia." Zhang Chenze said with her arms crossed, her expression blank. "When Han Yimo was injured, the first person he called out was you. Did you know each other before?"

Qi Xia didn't even lift his eyelids, supporting his forehead with his right hand as he answered, "No."

"Then do you have any clues about his death?" Zhang Chenze continued to ask.

Qi Xia didn't answer, instead examining the giant sword on Han Yimo's body.

This sword had an ancient style, like an exquisite work of art.

It bore numerous battle scars, as if it had experienced many conflicts.

But in this day and age, who would wield such a giant sword in fights?

"Qi Xia, I'm talking to you." Zhang Chenze said irritably, "Aren't you planning to explain anything?"

"What do I need to explain?" Qi Xia asked, "Are you suggesting I killed Han Yimo?"

"Regardless of whether you're the murderer, you should say something to clear your suspicions, right?"

Qi Xia still didn't answer, instead reaching out to pull the sword.

"Hey!" Officer Li hurried over upon seeing this, "Qi Xia, regardless of whether you're the murderer, we need to preserve the crime scene! Otherwise..."

"Otherwise what?" Qi Xia interrupted, "Otherwise, when the police come to investigate, evidence might be easily lost?"

Officer Li's mouth moved slightly, but he was at a loss for words.

At this point, let alone waiting for the police to investigate, even whether he could get out alive was uncertain.

Seeing Officer Li fall silent, Qi Xia used both hands with force to continue pulling the sword.

He used almost all his strength to completely extract the sword from the ground.

Qiao Jiajin also went up to help, only to discover that the giant sword was heavier than he had imagined. This pitch-black ancient sword, made of some unknown metal, weighed about one hundred and fifty jin (approximately 75 kg), equivalent to a strong adult man.

Qi Xia panted heavily, throwing the iron sword on the ground with a loud clang.

After a while, when Qi Xia had steadied his breathing, he finally spoke to Zhang Chenze: "Lawyer Zhang, let me confirm with you. This iron sword is the length of a person and weighs over a hundred jin. You now suspect that I lifted this iron sword and silently killed Han Yimo, who couldn't even move, at dawn, and then I plunged the sword deep into the ground?"

Zhang Chenze pursed her lips, her expression not pleasant.

"And before that, to prevent you from discovering it, this iron sword was hidden in my pants pocket, right?" Qi Xia asked again.

Seeing the atmosphere turn tense, Officer Li stepped in to mediate: "Qi Xia, since you didn't kill Han Yimo, why must you pull out the sword?"

Qi Xia didn't engage with Zhang Chenze anymore, instead looking down at the giant sword covered in fresh blood.

He examined it carefully, shook his head, and then turned the iron sword over.

Sure enough, on the other side of the hilt, three small characters were engraved: "Seven Black Sword."

Among the useful information in what Han Yimo had said earlier, there wasn't much. He seemed to be trying to accept some reality, but unfortunately, he couldn't figure it out before he died.

And among these words, the only information that Qi Xia remembered was the three characters "Seven Black Sword."

"This sword is called 'Seven Black Sword'?" Qiao Jiajin asked from the side.

Qi Xia gently stroked his chin, muttering to himself: "These three characters are on the other side of Han Yimo, which means when he was pierced, he shouldn't have known the name of this sword. So why would he mention 'Seven Black Sword'?"

"I think your line of thinking is rather strange." Officer Li shook his head and said, "Why care about the name of a murder weapon? Shouldn't the current problem be considering Han Yimo's cause of death?"

Qi Xia glanced at Officer Li, then said: "When Han Yimo was stabbed, it was daylight. Even if he was sleeping at the time, with such a severe injury, he would definitely have opened his eyes. Theoretically, he should have seen the murderer, yet he didn't mention the murderer's name at all, instead mentioning 'Seven Black Sword' twice. Isn't that strange?"

"But he called your name..." Xiao Ran said softly from the side, "Regardless of what sword it was, Han Yimo did call out your name first..."

"So what?" Qi Xia asked.

"So you're the murderer..." Xiao Ran said timidly, hiding behind Officer Li, not daring to look at Qi Xia.

Qi Xia didn't defend himself, just stared at Xiao Ran, as if judging whether this woman was the real murderer or simply foolish.

"And our companion is dead, but you show no sadness at all, instead calmly analyzing the situation here. But you're a con artist! What use is your analysis?!" Xiao Ran said with a crying tone, "Who among us would believe you?"

"'Sadness'?" Qi Xia frowned, as if somewhat confused, "Are you saying... I should be sad for someone I've known for less than a day?"

"You're so cold-blooded, that's why I say you're like the murderer!" Xiao Ran's voice gradually grew louder, "Didn't you want to leave last night? Why did you insist on staying here overnight? If you think about it carefully, you deliberately stayed just to kill someone, right?"

At this point, Qi Xia had roughly understood that the woman before him might not necessarily be the murderer, but she was definitely foolish.

In the initial room, she had once shouted things like "Why should we trust this con artist."

To her, "logic" was useless; she only believed in the results she wanted to believe.

Qiao Jiajin couldn't stand it anymore, saying to Xiao Ran: "Hey, silly girl, if you don't like using your brain, don't interrupt others when they're speaking. I think what the con artist is analyzing makes sense."

"But you three weren't good people to begin with!" Xiao Ran retorted aggrievedly, "Someone died here, and you three are the most suspicious, right? What's wrong with me being stupid? I may be stupid, but I wouldn't do bad things!"
