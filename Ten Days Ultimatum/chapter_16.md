# Chapter 16: One Wave After Another

Although the others lacked medical knowledge, they generally understood what Dr. Zhao meant.

For them now, removing the harpoons was simple, but suturing a wound was difficult.

"The writer's life has been saved for now. The only thing we need to do is get out of here quickly and find a place with proper conditions to treat his wound again."

Dr. Zhao's words brought everyone's thoughts back to reality.

If they couldn't leave this strange room, they would all end up like Han Yimo sooner or later.

"But how do we leave? Is the 'game' over?" Lin Qin asked, covering her nose and mouth.

Qi Xia pondered carefully for a moment, then shook his head.

The message on the mask had been clear: the one called 'Human Dog' wanted them to survive and had said 'see you after the rain.'

Logically, after this rain-like barrage of harpoons, the so-called 'Human Dog' should appear, possibly bringing the next game.

But why hadn't he appeared?

"Hey, liar." Qiao Jiajin slowly walked to Qi Xia's side, asking with a serious expression, "You have a way to survive, don't you?"

"So what?" Qi Xia replied coldly, "Whether I can survive or not, what does that have to do with you?"

"I'm not as smart as you, so I need to find someone to cooperate with." Qiao Jiajin seemed to be recommending himself, "You have the brains, I have the strength. Let's work together."

Hearing this, Qi Xia frowned slightly.

"Sorry, I'm a liar. I don't plan to trust anyone except myself."

Before Qiao Jiajin could speak again, a question suddenly came from Officer Li.

"What is this?"

Everyone turned to look and saw Officer Li carefully examining the harpoon in his hand.

"What's wrong?"

Dr. Zhao approached Officer Li cautiously and asked.

"There's writing." Officer Li handed the harpoon to Dr. Zhao.

Dr. Zhao took it and looked, his expression changing. Sure enough, there was tiny text on the finger-thick tail end of the harpoon:

"I am 'Human Goat.' If you can see these words, it means you've survived."

"But how many of you actually survived?"

"Is anyone injured?"

"I'm truly very worried about you."

"I can't just watch you all die."

"Fifteen minutes from now, death will descend from the sky again."

"Dodge them, find a way to survive."

Dr. Zhao gritted his teeth, then slammed the harpoon fiercely onto the ground.

"Are you kidding me! This never ends!" he roared loudly, seemingly wanting to release all the emotions he had suppressed until now.

"Calm down!" Officer Li said in a deep voice, "If you can't control your emotions, how will you survive?"

"Survive...? But we're already dead!!" Dr. Zhao finally couldn't take it anymore, "We're already dead, yet we're still being tormented by the fear of death. What does the 'organizer' want?! Can't he just kill us or let us go?"

Everyone's faces looked grim at this moment. Yes, what was the point of this wave after wave of death threats?

Was it really as the goat-headed man had said, to select a 'god'?

Would everyone except the one who becomes a 'god' go to hell?

"Everyone, we've survived two 'games.' Do you think it's because we're smart? No!" Dr. Zhao clenched his fists tightly, "We've just been too lucky! But what about next time? And the time after that? In this ever-changing room, how long can we possibly survive?!"

Officer Li pressed his lips together, stepped forward, and grabbed Dr. Zhao by the collar: "Hey... buddy! In a life-or-death situation like this, the one thing we can't lack is 'morale'! If you don't want to live, you can go die by yourself! Don't shake everyone's confidence here!"

"I...!" Dr. Zhao's lips trembled slightly, "But how do we get out? Do you have a way to lead us out?"

Officer Li pondered for a moment, then said: "I don't have a 'way,' I only know we need to survive! As long as we survive, there's still hope."

He released his grip on Dr. Zhao, walked aside to pick up a harpoon to examine it, then went to Han Yimo's side to look at the harpoon in his shoulder, discovering that both harpoons had the same text.

It seemed their luck was truly extraordinary.

Not only did they have to dodge the deadly attacks in the previous round, but they also needed to keep at least one harpoon to learn the clues for the next round.

"Regardless, at least this time we have clear clues." Officer Li read the words on the harpoon carefully and said, "Unlike last time, this attack will only come from above."

He pointed to the small words on the harpoon that read 'death will descend from the sky again.'

As soon as he finished speaking, the room began to change again.

All the holes in the walls were now slowly disappearing, while the countless holes in the ceiling also began to shift positions.

In the end, only nine remained.

Three holes in each row, with three rows total.

"It looks like the game is getting simpler." Officer Li looked at the nine holes in the ceiling and sighed, "I guess that's a silver lining in this misfortune."

"But why is it 'Human Goat' again this time?" Lawyer Zhang pointed to the corpse on the ground that had been torn apart by harpoons and asked, "Wasn't Human Goat already killed by us?"

Qi Xia pondered for a moment, also finding it strange.

The goat-headed man who had just died had indeed called himself 'Human Goat,' but the message inside his mask had said 'I am Human Dog.'

First a goat, then a dog.
