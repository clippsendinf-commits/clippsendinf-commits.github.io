# Chapter 38: Black Visitor

"This is a bit strange..." Qi Xia said softly, "I thought a 'physical elimination game' would have a more complex venue, so that participants could be continuously eliminated."

"You're right." Qiao Jiajin nodded, also looking at the square venue and the iron plate in the center, his expression confused, "How are they going to eliminate us here?"

As soon as he finished speaking, the large iron gate in front of everyone vibrated, then slowly rose.

"Huh?" The fat middle-aged man saw the gate open, looking puzzled, "What is this? Do we need to move forward?"

Just as the gate fully opened, the countdown on the wall also started moving.

It seemed the game had truly begun.

"What's going on?"

Everyone looked at each other, completely unaware of the current situation.

But the next second, a low, muffled roar came from inside the gate.

That sound... wasn't human.

"Damn it..." The hairs on Qiao Jiajin's body stood up, "This can't be right..."

A huge, completely black animal walked out from the gate. It stood on two legs, its mouth slightly open, continuously dripping saliva. Its eyes looked as if it had been hungry for three days.

After it completely walked out of the iron gate, the gate immediately closed.

"This is... a bear?!" Qiao Jiajin couldn't help but take a step back. If the opponent was human, he had full confidence to fight them, but the opponent turned out to be a bear over a person's height.

Qi Xia took a closer look, his expression darkening. This bear was a 'black bear', with a very obvious white crescent pattern on its neck, but this black bear was simply too large.

Generally, black bears' height rarely exceeds humans, approximately between 1.6 to 1.8 meters, but this one looked at least 2 meters tall, extremely terrifying.

"Ah!"

A girl wanted to scream but subconsciously covered her mouth, though a bit of sound still leaked out.

This abrupt sound not only startled everyone but also frightened the black bear.

After a brief pause, the black bear let out an even lower, muffled roar, appearing to be angered.

"What the hell kind of game is this!" The middle-aged man wailed loudly, then turned and ran, but after three steps, he froze in place.

He discovered that the stairs they had come down had disappeared.

At this moment, behind them was just a high wall, with no way to retreat.

The middle-aged man seemed to have lost his mind, sitting on the ground: "It's over... we're dead... we're definitely going to die..."

"Damn it... what do we do?" Qiao Jiajin turned to look at Qi Xia, "This is no longer something we can win through physical strength alone."

"This isn't easy to handle..." Qi Xia's expression also began to grow heavy.

Why did the opponent have to be a bear?

A bear's close-range lethality is even greater than that of tigers and lions, and this limited venue is its perfect hunting ground.

Watching the huge black bear approach step by step, the two young girls closest to it were already so frightened they couldn't move.

"Quick, quick, play dead!" The middle-aged man sitting on the ground shouted, "When encountering a bear, playing dead gives you a chance to survive!"

This shout startled the two girls at the front back to their senses. They immediately lay on the ground, closing their eyes while trembling.

"No!" Qi Xia also shouted, "Get up! Run!"

But the two girls completely ignored Qi Xia's words, lying motionless on the ground.

Seeing someone playing dead, the rest of the people also lay down on their backs. Now, only Qi Xia, Qiao Jiajin, and a slightly chubby girl remained standing in the venue.

"Con artist, isn't playing dead correct?" Qiao Jiajin also asked with a serious expression, "Shouldn't you play dead when encountering a bear?"

"If you encounter a brown bear, playing dead gives you a chance to survive, but not with a black bear!" Qi Xia shook his head seriously, "Brown bears don't eat humans; they attack humans only to protect their territory. When they believe a dead human poses no threat to them, they will stop attacking. But black bears are different. Black bears will eat humans when extremely hungry!"

As soon as he finished speaking, the huge black bear approached one of the girls playing dead, sniffing her face with its nose.

"Foolish..." Qi Xia thought to himself that this was bad. Even if humans tried their best to escape from a black bear, they would have a slim chance of survival, let alone lying on the ground waiting for death.

Sure enough, after sniffing for a few seconds, the black bear suddenly opened its mouth and bit the girl's neck.

The girl let out a scream, but the sound abruptly stopped, stuck in her throat.

Her flailing hands continuously beat against the black bear, but it felt like hitting a hard sandbag.

The black bear didn't loosen its grip but extended its front paw, firmly slapping the girl's chest.

The chest visibly collapsed, looking as if all the bones were broken.

The girl spurted out a large mouthful of blood, and her entire body went completely still.

Seeing this scene, Qi Xia's heart seemed to skip a beat.

He had only seen news about animal attacks on his phone but had never witnessed it with his own eyes. This scene was simply a massacre.

Everyone, regardless of gender, gasped.

Only now did they finally believe that playing dead was useless, and they scattered in all directions.

Although humans are the rulers of the Earth, they are completely powerless against these Earth natives.

Without tools and weapons, how can one fight against this bear?

Wait a moment... tools and weapons?

Qi Xia suddenly thought of the iron plate in the center of the venue, the one the size of a table.

Who said there were no tools and weapons here? Didn't the organizer leave something here?

"Qiao Jiajin, we need to get that iron plate!" Qi Xia said, "Although I don't know what it is, it looks like it can protect us."

The chapter ends with a note that there's more to read on the next page, but I should only translate what's provided.

Let me review my translation to ensure it's accurate and flows well in English:

I've maintained the character names as they were in the original text (Qi Xia, Qiao Jiajin)
I've translated the setting and action descriptions accurately
I've preserved the tension and horror of the scene with the bear
I've made sure the dialogue sounds natural in English while keeping the original meaning
I've included the chapter title and number with a hash symbol for markdown formatting
