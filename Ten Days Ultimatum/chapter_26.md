# Chapter 26: The Dead

"Ten days from now, so this should be considered 'Day Zero', right?" Lin Qin switched hands to cover her mouth and nose, then added, "If you go out now, you won't be able to see the road clearly soon. After all, there are no street lights here."

Qi Xia knew Lin Qin was right, so he quietly walked to the side, found a clean shelf, and sat down.

He had indeed been too anxious, even forgetting to check the time.

But he was desperate to leave this hellish place, to see his wife.

To see Yu Nian'an.

To see that girl who loved to wear white clothes.

"Xiao An, I'll escape from this hellish place soon," he murmured to himself, "Wait for me, we'll have money soon."

Qi Xia's expression remained different from the others. He wasn't panicked or sad, just anxious.

As the sky darkened, everyone found clean places to sit down.

Fortunately, the nights here weren't cold. Everyone was just hungry, having gone without food or water for nearly a day, each feeling weak.

No one spoke anymore. They just slowly watched the earthy-yellow sun set, as the world completely fell into darkness.

The day's experience was like a terrible nightmare for everyone. They all fantasized that when they opened their eyes again, all the strange phenomena before them would disappear.

The entire city seemed to quiet down, as if brewing something. Everyone heard what seemed like rustling sounds in the distance, but couldn't make them out clearly.

It was too dark here, so dark they couldn't tell if their eyes were open or closed.

Everyone had grown up in cities since childhood and had never experienced a night so dark they couldn't see their own hands.

"Liar, are you asleep?" Qiao Jiajin suddenly asked not far from Qi Xia.

"What?"

"Do you think... there are other 'participants' here?" Qiao Jiajin asked.

Qi Xia was silent for a moment, then replied: "I've thought about this too. The 'Human Dragon' said tens of millions of people have walked out of the door. Logically, there should be more than just the nine of us..."

Qiao Jiajin was also silent for a while, then asked: "That female shopkeeper, could she be someone who walked out of the door before?"

"Huh?" Qi Xia was slightly taken aback. He had never thought in that direction, after all, the woman seemed to have been living here for many years.

But on second thought, this wasn't contradictory. Whether people were brought here ten years early or ten days early didn't matter. What mattered was that, according to the 'Human Dragon', this place would be annihilated in ten days.

They might have different starting points, but the same end.

Fortunately, they shouldn't end up completely crazy like the female shopkeeper, since they only need to stay here for ten days.

In any case, they would see the 'result' after ten days.

"Liar? Are you asleep?" Qiao Jiajin asked.

Qi Xia no longer paid attention to him, but turned his head to one side, seriously contemplating what had happened today.

What was the reason for all these strange circumstances?

Not getting an answer from Qi Xia, Qiao Jiajin stopped bothering him and gradually fell silent.

After a short while, two more people started talking in the darkness. It sounded like Dr. Zhao and Officer Li.

"Dr. Zhao..."

"Yes?"

"I want to ask... if a woman is malnourished for a long time, can she give birth to life?"

Dr. Zhao was silent for a moment, understanding Officer Li's meaning. The female shopkeeper in the room seemed not to have eaten for a long time, so how could she have given birth to a child?

Others seemed interested in this question too, all quietly waiting for his answer.

Dr. Zhao organized his thoughts and said: "This is a complex question. If a woman is malnourished for a long time, it can easily lead to irregular menstruation, or even amenorrhea and menopause. In other words, lack of basic nutrients can cause them not to ovulate, naturally making it impossible to conceive."

"So... is this another thing that science cannot explain?" Officer Li asked in a deep voice, "The female shopkeeper's physical condition looks very poor."

"I can't draw a definitive conclusion. In some regions of Africa, people's nutritional intake is also very low, but they still have relatively high birth rates..." Dr. Zhao sighed, "But this isn't my area of expertise. It involves each person's physical constitution and intake of key nutrients, so I don't know much about it."

After hearing this, Officer Li said nothing more and fell silent.

Everyone in the room fell into silence again.

Qi Xia didn't want to sleep at first, but with complete loss of vision, a person's perception becomes blurry, and they slowly stop thinking.

Accompanied by the quiet "rustling" sound on the street, Qi Xia's eyelids grew heavy.

He didn't know when he fell asleep. In his dream, he saw Yu Nian'an.

"Xia, do you know? There are many paths in this world, and everyone has their own path."

"Yes, Xiao An, I know." Qi Xia in the dream nodded, "I'll be out soon. Wait for me."

After some unknown amount of time, a huge bell rang, almost as if it were right beside their ears, like thunder.

Qi Xia opened his eyes and hurriedly stood up, finding that it was already bright outside.

Turning around, everyone was still shaken, just like Qi Xia, looking around. The bell was too loud and had woken them.

"What's going on?!" Xiao Ran instinctively hid behind Officer Li.

Before anyone could react, a strange coughing sound came from the corner of the room.

That coughing sounded as if the person had a mouthful of water.

Dr. Zhao noticed the sound came from behind, so he slowly turned around, only to see a terrifying scene.
