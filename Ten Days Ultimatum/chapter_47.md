# Chapter 47: Escape

As the onlookers watched in panic, Earth Ox slowly approached.

"You two, stop." he said calmly, "It doesn't matter if you kill each other, but please take it outside this room."

The two paid him no mind, completely ignoring Earth Ox as they gritted their teeth and secretly exerted their strength.

Earth Ox looked at the two grappling figures and, giving up on persuasion, bent down. He effortlessly removed Qiao Jiajin's arm from Zhang Shan's neck, then grabbed Zhang Shan's collar with his left hand and Qiao Jiajin's arm with his right. With a gentle toss, the two flew away like small pebbles, knocking over all the chairs.

"Damn it..." Qiao Jiajin felt as if his bones were about to break.

On the other side, Zhang Shan wasn't faring much better either. He lay on the ground, rolling in pain as all his wounds bled.

"You... damn old ox, one day I'll skin you alive..."

At this moment, everyone rushed forward to check on the two.

"Hey, Qiao Jiajin, are you still alive?"

Hearing this, Qiao Jiajin gave a bitter smile: "What do you think..."

Tian Tian and Lin Qin also gathered around, helping Qiao Jiajin to his feet.

Meanwhile, Zhang Shan was helped up by Little Glasses and Lao LÃ¼.

"Are you okay? Zhang Shan?" Little Glasses asked.

"I'm fine." Zhang Shan scratched at the wounds on his body, feeling uncomfortable but still turning to Little Glasses and saying, "It seems you were right, those two are quite interesting."

"Right!" Little Glasses seemed pleased as if he himself had been praised, smiling happily, "The tattooed man is very strong, and that one called 'Liar' is extremely clever. The two of them are definitely qualified."

Lao LÃ¼, however, kept pursing his lips to the side, seemingly not agreeing with Little Glasses.

"Come on, let's go talk with them again." Zhang Shan laughed heartily, leading the two forward again.

Before they had taken three steps, Earth Ox extended a pitch-black hand and pressed it on Zhang Shan's shoulder.

"Still looking for trouble?"

Zhang Shan looked at Earth Ox and said: "Don't worry, just a simple conversation."

Earth Ox considered for a moment, then withdrew his hand.

"Be careful, I'm watching you."

In just a few steps, Zhang Shan and Qi Xia, Qiao Jiajin faced each other again.

Qiao Jiajin stepped forward, blocking Qi Xia: "Big guy, planning to settle the score with me again after we leave?"

"Forget it." Zhang Shan scratched at the shocking wounds on his chest, "I don't have the strength today. I'll schedule another time with you."

"Ha." Qiao Jiajin was amused by the other, "Since you're not here to fight, what do you want with us?"

"That's not fair." Zhang Shan shook his head helplessly, "I wasn't looking for a fight from the beginning. It was your friend who suddenly attacked me."

Qiao Jiajin thought for a moment and realized this was indeed the case.

"Not looking for a fight?" Qi Xia found the man before him somewhat strange, "Then what do you want with us?"

Zhang Shan turned back, waved at Little Glasses and Lao LÃ¼, and the two immediately removed cloth bags from their waists and handed them to him. Although Lao LÃ¼ looked reluctant, he seemed to fear Zhang Shan and could only follow his instructions.

Zhang Shan weighed the two cloth bags in his hands, then tossed them to Qi Xia.

"Thirty-eight 'Dao' in total. For you."

Qi Xia caught the two bags in disbelief, opened them, and indeed found golden spheres inside.

"What does this mean?" Qiao Jiajin looked at Zhang Shan suspiciously, "We haven't decided a winner yet. Why are you giving us the 'Dao'?"

"Because this was agreed upon in the game. When you make a bet, you must accept the outcome." Zhang Shan looked back at Little Glasses and continued, "Besides, Little Glasses has praised you repeatedly in front of me, saying you two are quite good."

"Quite good?" Qi Xia and Qiao Jiajin looked at each other, not knowing what the other was planning.

"I didn't come looking for you to cause trouble either." Zhang Shan extended a finger, tapped his temple, and said to Qi Xia, "Little Glasses told me you defeated that black bear with this. Is that true?"

Qi Xia didn't answer, still watching Zhang Shan cautiously.

"Don't overthink it." Zhang Shan said, "We're gathering a group of capable people to get out of this place together. Are you two interested in joining?"

"No." Qi Xia answered.

"Don't refuse so quickly..." Zhang Shan gave a simple laugh, reached out and patted Qi Xia's shoulder, "You can think about it some more."

"That's right!" Little Glasses also stepped forward, saying to Qi Xia and Qiao Jiajin, "Mr. Qiao, Mr. Liar, both of your abilities are outstanding. We have a great chance of getting out of here."

"Mr. Liar?" Qi Xia thought he had misheard, "You're calling me?"

"Yes..." Little Glasses thought he had said something wrong, "Hasn't Mr. Qiao been calling you 'Liar'...?"

Qi Xia shook his head helplessly and said, "Forget it, a name is just a form of address. Call me whatever you want, but I won't join you."

"Why so firm?" Little Glasses was a bit confused, "As the saying goes, there's strength in numbers. Besides, I participated in a game with you and know you're a trustworthy teammate. If we work together..."

"But I don't trust you." Qi Xia interrupted, "Besides, only one person can get out of this place. What's the use of gathering more people? In the end, won't they just serve as cannon fodder?"

"O-only one person can get out?" Little Glasses was slightly stunned, "What nonsense are you talking about? Why can only one person get out of here?"

"Isn't that so?" Qi Xia asked in return, "Those animal masks said..."

Just as Qi Xia was about to say something, he suddenly froze.

Wait.

Why did I think only one person could get out?

Has anyone said something similar?

No, they haven't.

Human Goat had once told Qi Xia that if they won the game, one of them would become a "god."

At that time, Qiao Jiajin had clearly asked Human Goat, "What happens if we don't win the game?"

Human Goat's answer wasâ€”"If you don't win, that would be such a pity."

He had never mentioned the issue of escaping.

"Did I misunderstand...?"

The word "pity" is quite ambiguous.

Whose "pity" was Human Goat expressing at that time?

For himself... or for the participants?

Qi Xia blinked, feeling as if he understood something.

In this hellish place, besides "becoming a god" and "being destroyed," is there really an option to "escape"...?

"You... why do you think you can escape here together?" Qi Xia asked.

"Because we've seen people who've escaped from here, of course." Zhang Shan answered.
