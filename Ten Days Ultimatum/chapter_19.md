# Chapter 19: Omnipotent

"I..." The Human Snake froze slightly. He wanted to choose an answer, but realized that no matter how he responded, it would be futile.

"Hahahahaha!"

The Human Snake suddenly burst into laughter, laughing so hard he bent forward and backward. After a while, he stopped laughing and said: "You're truly interesting."

"Interesting?" Qi Xia looked coldly at the Human Snake. "What's so interesting? Haven't I already won?"

The Human Snake slowly walked to the wall and pulled down the lever.

Everyone felt their bodies drop, then begin to slowly descend.

Qiao Jiajin's face was full of confusion. He turned his head and asked Qi Xia: "Swindler, what does this mean? Why does this count as winning?"

Qi Xia noticed the ropes were indeed descending and secretly breathed a sigh of relief. "Think about it. The moment this question was asked, we were already saved no matter what."

"If my next question is 'Will you pull the lever,' would your answer be the same as to this question..." Qiao Jiajin silently repeated the question, completely unable to understand.

"I see..." Dr. Zhao nodded thoughtfully. "If he answers 'yes,' then the next question can only be answered with 'yes,' and we'll be saved. After all, the next question is 'Will you pull the lever.'"

"But what if he says 'no'?!" Qiao Jiajin felt he had found a loophole. "Couldn't he just say 'no'?"

"If he says 'no,' the next question can only be answered with 'yes,'" Han Yimo said weakly. "The beauty of this question is that if he answers 'no,' he admits he would give different answers to the two questions. Remember? This snake-headed man said he doesn't lie."

Qiao Jiajin froze, then turned to look at Qi Xia again and asked: "Did you think of all this just now... What kind of monster are you?"

"I wouldn't call myself a monster." Qi Xia shook his head. "I'm just a swindler who wanders the world."

As they spoke, the few people had slowly reached the ground.

Due to hanging for a long time, everyone's palms were burning with pain, and the conditions of the two injured were even more concerning.

"Everyone, congratulations on surviving the 'interview.' Push open this door, and a new world awaits you." The Human Snake put his hands behind his back and stood beside the wooden door.

"You bastard..."

Qiao Jiajin walked up fiercely, seemingly wanting to vent all his anger toward the "Human Goat" and "Human Dog" on the current "Human Snake."

The Human Snake turned coldly, looking at the aggressive Qiao Jiajin without moving.

"Are you all some kind of perverts?!" Qiao Jiajin shouted loudly, grabbing the Human Snake's collar as he stepped forward. "Wearing these strange masks, trying to kill us again and again, and now I've finally caught you!"

The Human Snake sneered and said in a low voice: "While you're still alive, I advise you to let go quickly."

"What did you say?!"

Qiao Jiajin raised his fist forcefully, but just as it was about to hit the snake-headed man's face, Officer Li grabbed his arm.

"Hey, did you forget the man whose head was smashed?" Officer Li said in a low voice. "If they're all the same kind of people, how do you plan to defeat them?"

"I..." A trace of unwillingness appeared on Qiao Jiajin's rugged face. He gritted his teeth and slowly uttered a few words, "But these damned..."

"Don't worry, we're getting out, aren't we?" Officer Li interrupted him, saying in a low voice, "Once we're out, I'll give them what they deserve."

Hearing this, everyone fell silent and slowly approached the Human Snake.

Looking at this person up close, they realized how eerie he was.

The temperature around the Human Snake was lower than in other places. His old suit and the mask on his head emitted a strange, fishy smell.

His eyes were looking out from behind the mask, clearly human. But the smell on his body was like a snake that had been dead for a long time.

"Everyone, welcome to the new world."

The muffled voice of the snake-headed man came from behind the mask, and then he turned and opened the door.

With a creak, light from outside streamed in.

Qi Xia frowned, noticing that outside wasn't the outdoors at all, but a corridor.

"Where's outside?" Qi Xia asked.

"I told you, it's a new world." The Human Snake slowly raised his hands. "The future 'god' will be born among you! Will be born in the new world! How exciting!"

"Another god..." Qiao Jiajin asked fiercely, "What exactly are you planning?"

Seeing someone ask a question, the Human Snake showed obvious interest: "An omnipotent god...! He can realize all thoughts!"

"Omnipotent?" Qiao Jiajin's eyebrows furrowed together.

Dr. Zhao subtly waved his hand at Qiao Jiajin, then said to the Human Snake: "Alright, we understand. Let us out quickly."

The Human Snake paused, then nodded and stepped aside.

Qi Xia walked up first, and the people behind him seemed unwilling to stay here any longer, quickening their pace to follow.

As soon as everyone stepped into the corridor, a special smell filled their nostrils.

How should one describe that smell?

Heavy, a very heavy smell.

This smell was as if billions of people around the world had died, then were exposed to the air and rotted. This rotting smell attracted countless insects to feast on them.

They reproduced in large numbers, then died in large numbers, and then rotted as well.

Let this overwhelming rotting smell settle for a while, and when it was no longer pungent, it became the heavy smell it was now.
