# Chapter 6: The Police Officer

"Stop trying to sow discord, kid." Officer Li glared at Qiao Jiajin, speaking sternly. "You're a loan shark, and I'm a police officer. Who do you think people will believe?"

Qi Xia looked at the arguing crowd. He knew Officer Li probably wasn't lyingâ€”he really was a criminal detective.

But he was heading in the wrong direction.

Perhaps it was professional instinct, or perhaps a sense of justice, but he kept trying to organize everyone in an orderly fashion.

The halftime break was more than halfway over, and the crowd gradually fell silent.

During this time, Qi Xia had repeated "My name is Li Ming" in his head countless times, until he started to get annoyed with himself.

After all, there was a body with a shattered skull lying next to him, making it impossible to find peace of mind.

Blood dripped from the table to the floor, drop by drop. The group had been in the same room with this corpse for nearly an hour, and a strange odor began to spread.

Qi Xia glanced casually at the body beside him. Its pants were already filthy.

After death, various organs lose the constraint of muscle strength in a short time, causing incontinence.

Before the smell of decomposition arrived, a foul stench had already assaulted their senses.

Qi Xia and another girl sat on either side of the body. The girl seemed quite displeased with the smell, constantly covering her mouth and nose with her hand.

Ten more minutes passed before the Goat Head finally spoke: "The twenty-minute halftime break is over. The game resumes."

The young man named Han Yimo from earlier steadied his nerves, took a deep breath, and said: "My name is Han Yimo. I'm an online novelist."

"Before coming here, I was writing the finale of a novel in my rented apartment. Since over a hundred characters appear in the book, and almost all of them appear in the finale, I was completely focused on writing and didn't hear anything happening outside."

"Even... I don't even know when the earthquake happened or when I lost consciousness..."

Han Yimo's story was different from everyone else's. At present, he seemed completely "independent," and his story ended abruptly after just a few short sentences.

"That's it?" The muscular man was slightly taken aback. "You think you can just say 'I don't know' and be done with it?"

"Because I can't lie, I don't need to fabricate an answer just to please everyone." Han Yimo's voice wasn't loud, yet it was strangely convincing.

"Alright... next then." Officer Li's expression still carried suspicion as he spoke again. "It's that lady's turn."

"Hey, cop." Qiao Jiajin was dissatisfied with Officer Li's attitude. "We're all 'participants.' Don't act like you're the team leader."

"Someone has to organize everyone, right?" Officer Li argued. "I've said it beforeâ€”only one of us is the enemy. The remaining eight people must unite."

"But that doesn't mean you get to give orders here." Qiao Jiajin paid no mind to Officer Li's words. "Outside, I might be afraid of you, but in this situation, who knows if you're the 'Liar'?"

"You two, stop arguing." The cool-voiced woman interrupted them.

This cool-voiced woman had accused the Goat Head of imprisoning everyone for twenty-four hours from the very beginning. She appeared logical and very calm.

Seeing that the two had calmed down, she continued: "In this so-called 'game,' no matter who wins in the end, the survivors could be considered 'indirect murderers.' After all, we collectively voted to have the Human Goat kill him. That's what you should be considering."

Hearing these words, Qi Xia's expression changed slightly.

If he really made it out of this room alive, then he had indeed "killed" the other eight people.

But what else could he do?

The card in front of him was a genuine "Liar" card. Who would willingly give up their own life to let others survive?

"My name is Zhang Chenze, and I'm a lawyer." The cool-voiced woman said with her arms crossed and an expressionless face, "It's unfortunate to meet everyone in such a strange place. Otherwise, I would have handed you my business card."

The group couldn't understand Zhang Chenze's humor at all, but she herself didn't seem to care.

"Before coming here, I was organizing court documents. My client was defrauded of two million yuan. The amount involved is huge, and the nature of the crime is vicious."

When she mentioned the figure "two million," everyone's expression remained normal, but Qiao Jiajin was clearly shocked and asked: "Two million?"

"That's right, two million. They say lawyers are the most impartial and selfless people, but we have personal feelings too. That man, in order to support his family, resorted to borrowing from loan sharks, which is very concerning. But illegal lending is another case, and it has nothing to do with me."

"When the earthquake happened, I was driving to meet my client on Qingyang Avenue. I had just passed Du Fu Thatched Cottage and was near Wuhou Shrine. I remember... I wasn't driving fast, about forty miles per hour, when I suddenly saw the ground crack open not far ahead."

"I immediately braked and stopped steadily in front of the crack, but I didn't expect the cars behind me to be unable to avoid it in time, causing a chain collision."

"I only heard a few loud bangs before my car was pushed into the crack. Then I lost consciousness and ended up here."

Another story ended. At this point, only three people had yet to speak.

"Wuhou Shrine..." Dr. Zhao pondered for a moment and said, "Is it the Wuhou Shrine in Chengdu?"

"Yes, I work in Chengdu."

It seemed this earthquake had affected the entire country.

Based on these unfamiliar stories one after another, it was truly too difficult to guess who was lying.

"I'm next." Officer Li looked at everyone. "I already said my name earlier. I'm Li Shangwu, a criminal detective from Inner Mongolia."
