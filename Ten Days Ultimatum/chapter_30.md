# Chapter 30: Human Rat

"Damn it, another madman." Qiao Jiajin spat on the ground. "I feel like if we stay here long enough, we'll all go crazy too."

Qi Xia was irritated by this old man.

"Qi Xia, are you alright?" Lin Qin asked from the side.

"I'm fine." Qi Xia steadied his nerves. "These people can't stop me. I'm going to participate in the 'game' now. You don't need to follow me."

"I'll go with you." Lin Qin said. "Whatever 'game' you're participating in, I'll go with you."

Hearing this, Qi Xia slowly stopped in his tracks. He turned around and looked coldly at Lin Qin.

This gaze was exceptionally cold, frightening Lin Qin.

"Wh-what's wrong?"

"Lin Qin, what's your motive?"

"Motive?" Lin Qin asked back, somewhat confused. "Do I need to have a motive?"

Qi Xia stared into Lin Qin's eyes again and said, "What's your purpose in approaching me? No matter how I think about it, you should be following the other team, right? The three of us are not on the same path as you, and we shouldn't become companions."

Hearing Qi Xia's question, Lin Qin just smiled slightly and said, "I've said it before, I'm very interested in you. I want to know what you're thinking."

"I want to get out." Qi Xia said without hesitation. "I've said it many times, I want to get out, to see my wife. She can't live without me. Do you understand?"

Lin Qin blinked and replied, "I understand."

"My wife's name is Yu Nian'an. She suffered for me, took the blame for me. She's my life's only thought, so I must go back to find her. That's all I'm thinking. Is that clear enough?"

"Clear enough."

"Now you know what I'm thinking. Are you still not prepared to leave?" Qi Xia said coldly.

Lin Qin lowered her head slightly, and after thinking for a long time, she replied, "I'm sorry, but for certain reasons, I still can't leave."

Qi Xia frowned as he looked at Lin Qin. Although he didn't sense danger or lies from her, he still couldn't see through Lin Qin's purpose.

"Whatever..." Qi Xia, seeing that he couldn't reason with this woman, could only turn around and continue walking forward.

Qiao Jiajin also followed Qi Xia and said, "You swindler, we had an agreement. You have the brains, I have the strength. We'll cooperate."

"Do you also have a reason you must get out?"

"Yes." Qiao Jiajin nodded. "Although I don't want to die, I don't want to sit around waiting for death either."

"Cooperation is fine, but I need to make something clear first." Qi Xia glanced at Qiao Jiajin and continued, "You and I have no friendship. If only one person can get out in the end, I will abandon you without hesitation."

"Damn it... you have no sense of loyalty at all?" Qiao Jiajin shook his head helplessly. "Really not likable."

Hearing the conversation, Tian Tian silently lowered her head.

Everyone seemed to have a clear goal.

But compared to them, what was she doing?

Suppose she really overcame all difficulties and got out of this hellish place.

Suppose she really returned to the real world and went back to her original life, then she would once again live in dim days, warmly embracing those dirty old men.

Thinking about it this way... perhaps "dying here" would be a goodå½’å®¿.

"Tian Tian, what's wrong?" Lin Qin asked.

"Nothing."

After leaving the square, the group came to a street on the other side.

This street was different from the convenience store street. It seemed to be some small residential houses, with low buildings arranged in a crisscross pattern, and it was unclear if anyone lived here.

After walking a few steps, the four people saw another animal mask.

That person was standing at the door of an old room, hands behind their back.

Qi Xia walked straight toward them.

Only when he got closer did he realize that this person was wearing a huge rat mask, emitting a foul smell. But this person's figure was very small, not as strong as the animal masks they had seen before.

Qiao Jiajin asked, "Human Rat, right?"

The rat-headed person finally noticed the four people in front of them, then smiled and said, "I'm not 'Human Rat', I'm 'Human Rat' oh."

Her voice was very pleasant, a girl's.

This should be the first time the group encountered a woman under an animal mask.

"Damn it, you're getting cocky..." Qiao Jiajin said irritably. "I don't care what you are."

"Human Rat is Human Rat. If you call it wrong, it'll be troublesome." The girl said with a chuckle, "It's rare for someone to visit my place. Do you want to participate in a 'trial'?"

Qi Xia looked at the house behind the Human Rat and asked her, "What are the rules?"

"Rat 'trial', one 'Dao' for admission." The Human Rat was like a very patient salesperson, gently introducing to the group, "It's hard to find a 'trial' with such low difficulty in other districts."

"So what's the game behind you?" Qi Xia asked again.

The Human Rat turned around, pushed open the door, and walked inside. This was a small warehouse.

"My game is called 'Warehouse Dao Seeking'. There is one 'Dao' in this room now, limited to one person entering. Find the 'Dao' within five minutes, and you win. That 'Dao' will also belong to you."

Qi Xia felt something was wrong, so he asked again, "What if we can't find it?"

"Can't find it?" The Human Rat laughed out loud. "If you can't find it... your admission fee will be forfeited, and you'll lose one 'Dao'."

"Lose one 'Dao'?" Qi Xia was stunned. "That's it?"

The prompt mentions that there's more to the chapter, but I don't have the complete text. I'll translate what I have and add a note that this is only part of the chapter.

Actually, let me review the prompt again. It says "GIVE ONLY THE CHAPTER TRANSLATION ALONG WITH THE CHAPTER TITLE AND NUMBER. DON'T STOP BEFORE YOU HAVE TRANSLATED THE ENTIRE CHAPTER PROPERLY." But I don't have the complete chapter. The text ends with "å°ä¸»ï¼Œè¿™ä¸ªç« èŠ‚åŽé¢è¿˜æœ‰å“¦ï¼Œè¯·ç‚¹å‡»ä¸‹ä¸€é¡µç»§ç»­é˜…è¯»ï¼ŒåŽé¢æ›´ç²¾å½©ï¼" which means "Little master, there's more to this chapter, please click the next page to continue reading, it's more exciting later!"

This seems to be a message from a reading platform indicating that the chapter continues on the next page. Since I don't have the complete chapter, I'll translate what I have and note that this is only part of the chapter.
