# Chapter 17: The Goat and the Dog

"The goat and the dog..." Qi Xia narrowed his eyes, carefully pondering everything.

At first, the person who called himself "Human Goat" wanted them to kill each other, but now this "Human Goat" said he was very concerned about them, and that he couldn't bear to watch them die.

"This is a lie..." Suddenly, a flash of insight struck Qi Xia's mind.

That's it!

This is it!

Lying!

Everything was going in the direction Qi Xia had predicted. "Goat" and "Dog" weren't names at all, but "game types"!

Could "Goat" represent the story of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"? The shepherd boy who lied repeatedly received no help when he was truly in danger, so the "Goat" game involves "lies"â€”it's a game of "lying."

Could "Dog" represent loyalty, just as in the harpoon game earlier, where if they hadn't cooperated, none of them would have survived now? So could it be "cooperation"?

Qi Xia picked up the harpoon again. He knew that the "Goat" might have been lying when explaining the rules.

But in these few short sentences, which one was the lie?

"I can't bear to watch you die"â€”if this sentence was a lie...

"Wait a minute..." Qi Xia's eyes slowly widened, "This passage isn't the 'answer,' but a trap that will kill everyone."

"What are you talking about?" Qiao Jiajin asked, confused.

"This entire passage is a lie!" Qi Xia said decisively, "Standing by the wall will lead to 'death,' standing under the hole is where 'life' is!"

Dr. Zhao and Officer Li looked at each other, not understanding what Qi Xia was trying to express.

"Everyone, remember? The 'Goat' lies!" Qi Xia stood in the center of the room, trying to get everyone to move closer to him, "If we follow the rules he stated, we'll end up killing ourselves. This is the difference between the 'Goat' and the 'Dog'!"

"But is this really reasonable?" Xiao Ran asked timidly, "In the entire room, only above your head is there a hole. No matter how you think about it, that should be the most dangerous place..."

Qi Xia hadn't figured this part out either.

What could possibly fall from the hole in the ceiling to kill people standing by the wall?

"Hmm..." Qi Xia pondered for a moment, then changed his wording, "It doesn't matter. After this round, there's a high probability we can get out, so you can choose according to your own thoughts."

"How do you know we can get out?" Officer Li asked vigilantly.

"Because in this hint, there's no 'preview' of the next game," Qi Xia replied, "This suggests two possibilities: either this is the last game, or the organizer is very confident they can kill all of us in this game."

Everyone's expressions grew heavy after hearing this, but they had no way to argue.

"In any case, I'll stand here." Qi Xia pointed to his feet, "As for what you choose, that's up to you."

After hearing Qi Xia's words, Qiao Jiajin slowly came to his side and said, "I've said it before, I trust you."

"But I'm a liar," Qi Xia replied coldly.

"Doesn't matter."

Lin Qin thought carefully, then covered her mouth and nose and walked toward the center of the room.

"Hey! What are you doing?" Xiao Ran shouted from against the wall, "You really believe him?"

Lin Qin nodded slightly and said, "Yes. Think carefully, who is it that has kept us alive until now?"

Xiao Ran was startled when she heard this, suddenly feeling that Lin Qin made sense. After some internal struggle, she followed.

Han Yimo, clutching the wound on his shoulder, also walked over.

"You're... Qi Xia, right? I trust you too."

Tian Tian and Zhang Chenze followed.

At this point, only Dr. Zhao and Officer Li were still pressed against the wall.

"Hey, aren't you coming over?" Tian Tian shouted.

"I..." Dr. Zhao seemed hesitant, as if he hadn't decided what to choose.

"There's no need to force others." Qi Xia waved his hand, "This round doesn't involve cooperation. As long as you can survive, that's what matters."

The clock on the floor gradually approached 1:28.

Officer Li narrowed his eyes, staring at Qi Xia.

He didn't think this liar would choose to seek death now, but why was he leading everyone to stand under the hole?

At this moment, Lin Qin noticed their thoughts and said to them, "Qi Xia doesn't seem to be lying. Do you want to come over?"

"You can tell?" Officer Li asked in a low voice.

"Yes." Lin Qin nodded, "Because of my work, most of the time I can tell if someone is lying."

"In that case..." Officer Li and Dr. Zhao looked at each other, walked forward silently, and said to Lin Qin, "If a professional says so, we'll trust you."

Despite saying this, they still held fragments of the broken table in their hands.

When they reached under the hole, they raised the table fragments above their heads to protect themselves, in case something fell from the hole.

"You're quite clever." Qiao Jiajin cursed and was about to pick up a piece of the table from the floor.

Qi Xia glanced at the time and stopped Qiao Jiajin.

"Don't bother, there's no time."

As soon as he finished speaking, the clock struck 1:30. A loud chain sound came from the ceiling, as if something invisible was being wound up.

"Is this really okay, liar?" Qiao Jiajin looked up timidly, feeling that this scene was a bit like gambling, except this time the stakes were highâ€”nine lives.
