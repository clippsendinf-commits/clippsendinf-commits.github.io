# Chapter 20: Seeking the Dao

What do the Twelve Zodiacs represent?

And what lies at the end of this corridor?

The underworld?

On this seemingly endless dim corridor, the group trembled as they moved forward.

After several rounds of high-intensity "games," everyone felt physically and mentally exhausted. Now that they had suddenly relaxed, the aura of death that had been surrounding them had also faded.

Qi Xia inadvertently turned his head and saw Lin Qin standing beside him.

She was still covering her mouth and nose with her hand.

"Isn't it uncomfortable like that?" Qi Xia imitated Lin Qin's gesture, placing his own hand over his mouth and nose. "Although the smell here is terrible, you'll have difficulty breathing like that."

"Breathing?" Lin Qin was slightly taken aback, then revealed a smile. "I don't feel any difficulty breathing, it's just that if I don't cover my mouth and nose, it feels strange, like..."

"Like what?"

"Like I'm not wearing clothes." Lin Qin smiled shyly, then removed her hand from her face.

Her nose was quite straight, and her lips were very redâ€”there was really no need to cover them. Qi Xia didn't understand what "like not wearing clothes" meant.

Lin Qin smiled faintly, still feeling uncomfortable, so she covered her mouth and nose again with her hand.

"It's a bit embarrassing... don't you find it awkward?" Lin Qin asked Qi Xia, "exposing your mouth and nose like this."

"Why would it be awkward?" Qi Xia found it very strange.

"It's about 'masks'..." Lin Qin looked at Qi Xia with great confusion, her gaze like she was looking at an alien. "How can you be so calm without wearing a 'mask'?"

"Mas..."

Before Qi Xia could react, a strange light suddenly appeared in the distance.

Everyone was drawn to this light and looked forward.

It was the exit.

A light resembling the sunset glow was coming from the exit.

"We're getting out!!" Qiao Jiajin shouted excitedly, "I can see the sunset light!"

This shout was undoubtedly a shot of adrenaline for everyone. Dr. Zhao helped Han Yimo as they followed the group and quickened their pace.

"Sunset?" Qi Xia pondered for a moment, then said to everyone, "We woke up at twelve o'clock. After more than an hour of game time, it should be around two o'clock now. Whether it's two in the morning or two in the afternoon, it's impossible to see a 'sunset'."

"I think you're overthinking it," Officer Li shook his head. "The time in the room might not be accurate either. Perhaps the actual time now is evening."

Qi Xia nodded slightly. He knew Officer Li was right. All his knowledge about time came from the clock in the room, but no one could guarantee that the clock in the room showed the correct time.

After walking a few more steps, they saw a black shadow beside the exit.

As they continued forward, the shadow gradually took on a human form. He was also wearing an animal mask, but this mask made everyone feel nauseous.

Unlike all the other animal masks, this person's mask wasn't made from a single animal's head but was created by stitching together many organs.

His mouth was like a crocodile's, his nose like a cow's, fish scales were used on his face, snake skin on his neck. In addition, he had stitched a lion's mane and deer antlers onto his mask.

This creature was almost like...

"Hello, I am 'Human Dragon'." The stitched monster slowly spoke. "All survivors? How novel."

"Dragon...?"

Everyone subconsciously stopped walking, their nerves tensing up.

It wasn't because the "Dragon" was frightening, but because they were too familiar with this opening.

Every time someone introduced themselves like this, a terrifying game would follow.

"Don't be nervous, everyone. Your 'trials' have come to an end for now." Human Dragon waved his hand, and only then did everyone notice he was wearing eagle claw gloves.

All the animal organs on his body were somewhat rotten and bloated, emitting a foul smell, but he seemed unaware of it, continuing to speak on his own:

"I won't bring you new 'trials,' just give you some advice."

No one spoke. They huddled together, watching the Human Dragon before them with vigilant eyes.

"Ten days. You have ten days to change all of this." Human Dragon said slowly. "If you don't obtain 3,600 'Dao' within ten days, the world you're in will be annihilated. Everything you can see will perish with it."

This short sentence left everyone confused.

"3,600 'Dao'?" Qi Xia frowned. "What is 'Dao'? And what do you mean when you say the world we're in will be annihilated?"

"Questions, hehehe, very good." Human Dragon nodded. "Having questions shows you're still clear-headed. As for 'Dao,' it is..."

Human Dragon reached into his black suit pocket, fumbled for a while, and took out four small golden spheres.

The outer ring of these spheres was white, the inner ring was golden, and they shone with a golden light all over, looking rather strange.

"This is 'Dao'." Human Dragon continued. "With just 3,600 'Dao,' you'll be saved."

Qi Xia pondered for a moment, reached out and took one of the small spheres. This sphere didn't feel hard to the touch; it even had some elasticity.

"Take them. They were yours to begin with." Human Dragon said with a smile.

After thinking for a while, Qi Xia took the four "Dao."

"You've passed four trials: 'The Liar,' 'Bamboo Shoots After Rain,' 'Death From Above,' and 'Right and Wrong.' This is your reward, and also your 'chips'."

No one had expected that the things they had exchanged for their lives multiple times would turn out to be these inconspicuous little beads. At this moment, they didn't know what to say.

"'Dao'..." Qi Xia frowned, saying helplessly, "You mean if we can't find 3,600 of these little spheres, this place will be destroyed?"

"Hehehe, that's right. If this place is destroyed... you won't be able to get out." Human Dragon nodded. The fish scales and lion's mane on his face moved along with his head, looking very awkward.

"It seems you have quite a few of these spheres. Can't you gather 3,600 yourself?" Officer Li said decisively. "Besides, you're much stronger than us. You could obviously find them yourself. Why choose us?"

"Me?" Human Dragon sneered. "We are all sinners. Sinners cannot obtain 'Dao.' Only chosen ones like you can obtain 'Dao' and finally become 'gods'."

"This is absurd!" Zhang Chenze interrupted Human Dragon, her arms crossed over her chest, asking with slight anger, "Do you know what you're talking about?"
