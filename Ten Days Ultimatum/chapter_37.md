# Chapter 37: Team Division

"Here he comes!" Little Glasses called out excitedly. "He's finally here!"

The large man slowly approached them. He stood about one meter ninety tall, with a buzz cut.

He yawned as he felt his pockets, then asked the minotaur, "How much?"

"One 'Dao' for entry."

The big man pulled out a small ball from his pocket and flicked it with his thumb to the minotaur, who caught it steadily in his hand.

"Rested well... let's begin." The big man stretched and cracked his neck, saying in a low voice, "Let me see what you've come up with this time."

Qi Xia and the other three looked at this fierce-looking man, feeling he wasn't a kind person.

Qiao Jiajin paid little attention to the big man, as he had seen too many people like him on the streets.

These people relied on their strong bodies to act recklessly on the streets, and Qiao Jiajin had personally made several of them cry.

But he didn't know if this big man in front of him was also just a paper tiger.

With twenty people gathered, everyone began to slowly walk forward to pay the "entry fee."

Qi Xia thought for a moment and also took out four "Dao."

This was not a small amount for them. After paying these four, they would have only one "Dao" left.

"Are we really participating in this game?" Qiao Jiajin asked. "What about our strategy?"

"I'm struggling with that too," Qi Xia said. "Although it's risky, I feel that a game with twenty people participating together isn't something you encounter easily. It's worth taking a gamble."

After getting the consent of the other three, Qi Xia dropped four "Dao" into the box in front of the minotaur.

"Very good." The minotaur nodded, then turned around and opened the door, revealing a downward staircase leading to the basement.

"Participants, please enter."

He turned around and slowly walked down the stairs.

The participants followed behind him with cautious expressions, heading deeper into the ground.

"This venue looks quite large... it's not on the same level as the 'Human Rat's' at all," Tian Tian whispered softly.

"Be careful," Qi Xia replied. "I have a bad feeling."

The middle-aged man had declared before the game that people would "die" in this game, which made Qi Xia very concerned.

But now, what he feared wasn't death, but being forever buried in this strange place.

As a con artist, he had experienced too many life-threatening adventures, but without exception, he had survived them all.

Thinking carefully, this situation wasn't really different from the pastâ€”it was just another case of licking blood from the edge of a knife.

Before long, everyone reached the end of the stairs.

This was a small room, filled with the smell of age under the dim lighting. In the center of the room were twenty chairs.

On each side of the room, there was a door, painted with yellow and green paint respectively.

"Everyone, please take a seat," the minotaur said. "Don't worry, the game hasn't started yet."

After hearing this, everyone sat down skeptically, with Qi Xia and the other three sitting together in a row.

Only then did they notice that each armrest of the chairs had a small light, one yellow and one green.

"Since this is a team game, to ensure fairness, we will now conduct a 'random team division.' Please remain in your seats, or you will face 'sanctions' in advance."

As soon as these words were spoken, everyone's expression became unnatural.

The ones who reacted most strongly were Little Glasses and the middle-aged man: "What?! Team division?!"

Qi Xia stroked his chin and thought for a moment, knowing this setting only benefited the organizers.

If this was a "betting" game, they would need to minimize the participants' chances of winning. Thinking this way, the best method would be to disrupt everyone's teams.

The minotaur walked to a corner of the room, found a button switch, then turned back to give everyone a meaningful look and said, "The game officially begins."

After speaking, he pressed the button, and the lights on both sides of everyone's chairs began to flash. Yellow and green lights continuously changed, creating an eerie scene in this dim space.

Qi Xia looked at the small light on his armrest, feeling slightly nervous too.

If the "Ox" really represented a physical-type game, it wasn't within his area of expertise. This game would still rely on Qiao Jiajin's brute strength.

But if he could think this way, others would too.

For example, Little Glasses and the chubby middle-aged man had called that big man as their helper.

But it seemed everyone's little schemes were within the Earth Ox's grasp. He would try to avoid such situations, hence this "random team division."

Qi Xia knew that if he had extremely bad luck and was divided into different teams from Qiao Jiajin, the benefits of this game would become difficult to predict.

Before Qi Xia could come up with a complete strategy, the two-colored lights stopped flashing.

Some people's yellow lights lit up, while others' green lights lit up.

So this was the random team division.

Qi Xia turned his head to look at the division of the four people, feeling both happy and worried.

He was happy that both he and Qiao Jiajin had yellow lights lit up, so they were on the same team. But he was worried that the two girls had green lights lit up, placing them on the other team. If this was really a physical-type game, it would be very disadvantageous for them.

Sighs rose and fell among the crowd. It seemed that besides Qi Xia's team, other people's divisions were also unsatisfactory.

"Now I will announce the game rules," the minotaur said in a low voice. "Both sides will play independently, each with their own venue, unrelated to each other. As long as you can persist for ten minutes in the venue without being eliminated, you will pass. Finally, everyone can receive 'Dao' equal to the number of people who pass."
