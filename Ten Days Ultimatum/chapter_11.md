# Chapter 11: Continue

Qi Xia remained seated, neither standing up nor searching for clues.

He still felt something was off.

The psychologist Lin Qin also remained seated.

"What are you thinking about?" Lin Qin asked nonchalantly, covering her mouth and nose.

"Me?" Qi Xia was taken aback. "What? Are you going to give me a psychological diagnosis?"

"Not really. Although someone as intelligent as you likely has some psychological issues, this situation isn't suitable for psychotherapy." Lin Qin smiled slightly. "I just wanted to ask what you're thinking about."

Qi Xia pondered for a moment, then said: "I'm thinking about the reason."

"The reason?"

Ignoring Lin Qin, Qi Xia called out to Dr. Zhao instead, asking: "Doctor, how long can a person survive after being shot in the heart?"

Dr. Zhao turned back, thought for a moment, and said: "If I remember correctly, when someone is shot in the heart, they lose consciousness within seconds. But since medical 'death' refers to 'brain death,' even when unconscious, the brain continues to function for several minutes."

Qi Xia nodded: "The goat-headed man screamed for several minutes just now, which means his body structure is much more resilient than an ordinary human's, right?"

"Yes. He remained conscious for several minutes even after being shot in the heart."

Everyone quieted down upon hearing Qi Xia and the doctor's conversation.

Just moments before, it was because this con artist's thinking was clear that all nine people had survived.

"Then why do you think this happened?" Qi Xia extended his index finger and thumb, forming the shape of a gun, and placed it against his temple. "Most people would choose to commit suicide this way."

He thought for a moment, then pointed his hand upward toward his chin: "Or like this."

Qi Xia withdrew his hand and pointed to his heart:

"Regardless... a person committing suicide would choose a method that causes as little pain as possible. So why would he aim at his own heart?"

Qiao Jiajin was playing with the goat mask in his hand, then flipped the man's head over and said: "Maybe this bastard's skull is harder, and one shot couldn't kill him."

"Since he was coughing up blood, that proves his body structure is the same as ours." Officer Li said. "Even if he's stronger, at this distance, a shot to the head would definitely be fatal."

Qi Xia nodded: "If that's the case, I can only think of one reason."

He pointed to the mask in Qiao Jiajin's hand and said: "The reason the goat-headed person chose to shoot himself in the heart was most likely to protect something. The 'game' probably isn't over yet."

Qiao Jiajin was startled: "Are you saying... he was afraid of damaging his mask?"

"That's right."

Under Qi Xia's direction, Qiao Jiajin turned the sheepskin mask over, exposing the rough sheepskin lining to everyone.

A rotting, sour smell emanated from it.

Just as Qi Xia had suspected, words were written inside the sheepskin mask with a black pen.

Some parts were stained with blood, but Qiao Jiajin didn't mind. He grabbed his T-shirt and wiped it clean, finally making the writing legible.

"What the hell?" Qiao Jiajin was stunned and began reading the words in his non-standard Mandarin:

"I am 'Human Dog'."

"You are cursed."

"I hope you survive."

"The clock never stops, danger lurks from all directions."

"If you want to survive, turn toward your hometown one hundred times."

"Oh, by the way, they say bamboo shoots after rain, why aren't bamboo shoots afraid of the rain?"

"See you after the rain."

Qi Xia frowned slightly. It was indeed a clue for the next game...

The shadow of death hanging over everyone refused to disperse.

They had already died, but did they have to die again?

"Hey, con artist, what does this mean?" Qiao Jiajin asked.

"How would I know?" Qi Xia snorted coldly. "There are nine people here. Do I have to be the one to think?"

Lawyer Zhang Chenze slowly sat down on a chair and said: "Although I don't want to admit it, your way of thinking is very similar to the 'organizer's.' If you have any ideas, you should speak up."

"I..."

Before Qi Xia could speak, the walls around them suddenly began to change.

To everyone's shock, holes appeared out of thin air.

The cement walls now seemed like a constantly changing soft body.

After a moment, rows of holes were neatly arranged on the walls, as if they had been there all along.

At the same moment, the sound of chains pulling could be heard from all four sides.

"What's happening?" Everyone panicked in an instant.

"Look at the ceiling!" someone suddenly shouted.

Everyone looked up and found that even the ceiling was covered with dense holes.

Qi Xia finally stood up, took the sheepskin mask from Qiao Jiajin's hand, and carefully read the last sentence.

"See you after the rain."

"Rain...?"

Qiao Jiajin tiptoed to the wall, peeked inside a hole, and was so startled he jumped back several steps.

"Holy crap!"

He shouted, looking for a place to hide, but found there was nowhere to hide.

"What's wrong? What's inside?" Xiao Ran asked fearfully.

Everyone knew Qiao Jiajin was quite brave, so for him to be scared enough to retreat repeatedly, it must be something extraordinary.

"Holy mother of...!" Qiao Jiajin shouted, "They're harpoons! The holes are filled with 'retreating' harpoons!"
